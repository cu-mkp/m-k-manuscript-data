Sand for casting in gold

Take common sand of alum, of plaster &amp;
brick, according to the composition said above. Add to it some
more feather alum. And mix in not quite the third
part of crocum ferri. However, its quantity cannot
be harmful, for it is that which receives the gold &amp; thanks
to which it comes out very neatly. But it were good that your
crocum had previously been in the
glassmakerâ€™s fornaise, three or four
days and three days and three
nights, in a flat box where it should not be very thick, so that it reheats better.



You could cast gold well in common sand of
goldsmiths, should you throw therein some substance that makes it
run. Before the invention of crocum, one would cast
flowers in silver but not at all in gold. It has not been
forty years that one knows this in
Germany.



Sublimate is commonly employed by goldsmiths for
gold. Some add sulfur, but they &amp; others are wrong,
for sulfur sours, even as it heats. And the sublimate is
agitated, boils, and bubbles. It is very good to clean gold
because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in
smoke. But to warm gold &amp; conserve its heat, there is only
the couleur, which is verdet, sal ammoniac,
saltpeter &amp; borax. This makes it run, &amp; you can
throw in a branch of wormseed.
