Casting for gold and silver



It is necessary that the molds be fiery red &amp; ablaze when
you cast in gold &amp; silver, or you burn flowers and
bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the
molded thing because the substance flows better when at ease and
without shaking the mold, &amp; does not become as porous.
