Lizards

When one takes them with two fingers from the
sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their
g mouth, then one takes the a
end of its lower mandible with the end of the
fingernail, &amp; next, with the upper mandible,
he bites the nail, but he cannot pass through, but he
clenches very strongly. And if he were to bite living flesh it would
au not let go, &amp; there would be no better remedy
than to promptly cut off his head. In the spring, as they
have changed skin, they are more beautiful.




The small lizards that one takes in the summer, the
size of small female lizards, grey on the back &amp; green on
the belly, are very appropriate to cast in silver &amp;
gold, or other metal, because they have rougher scales
than the female lizards &amp; show better.
