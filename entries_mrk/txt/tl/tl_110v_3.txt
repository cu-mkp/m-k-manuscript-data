Cast of lead and tin

Because tin wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal,
plant, or other thing for molding is espe thin &amp;
fine, do it so that there is more tin, much more than
lead, namely less than the fourth part lead for three
parts tin. And still, one puts lead only to form an
alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong &amp;
thick, put a lot more lead in than tin. And in one &amp;
the other you can put a little looking-glass tin, but only a
little, with a little rosin, when you want to cast. Since
then, when molding with fine and new lead, I put into one
lb two ounces of fine tin. And when molding
with fine tin, I put in two ounces of fine lead
for one pound. I made plants &amp; snakes just like
nature.

S



I cast tin almost red, and lead the same, which, however,
had not remained in the fire for too long, for it becomes brittle and
calcines.
