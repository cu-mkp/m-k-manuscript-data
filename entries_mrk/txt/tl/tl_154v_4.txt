Reinforcing flowers and delicate things

For flowers &amp; delicate things
&amp; herbage, one does not use wheat oil but melted
butter, of which one gives a light # coat
 on the back of the petals of the
rose flower &amp; the pansy &amp; other flowers that
need it. But one reinforces the little legs of flies &amp;
other small animals with wheat oil to strengthen them
&amp; make them hold up.
