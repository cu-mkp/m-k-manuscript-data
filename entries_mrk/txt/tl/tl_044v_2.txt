Excellent water against the plague of Monsieur de
Montorsin

Take some theriac, rue &amp;
dittany, &amp; good vinegar, put the whole in a
glass bottle, leave it half-open &amp; well strapped, and
put it in a very long bath for three or 4 days. Then
separate your decoction from the residue, of which in time of
need you will pour some on a flaming red tile &amp; receive
the vapor of it &amp; also fumigate your clothes with it. This is a very
rare &amp; tested secret.
