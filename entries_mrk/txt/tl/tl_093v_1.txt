Faces in distemper

Because colors in distemper dry promptly &amp; one would not
have leisure to perfect the shadows &amp; touches on the face, one wets
the reverse of the face which is on canvas with a wet
sponge. Then, with a small paintbrush, one makes
the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
areas. And with another paintbrush, one does the shadows
again by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
because they are made of bistre, which stains the canvas
like rust. The said bistre is good with for
making shadows in distemper mix, for in oil it
has no body &amp; would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in
the said bistre, for shadow, ocre de ru &amp; a
little sap green. The best bistre is the greasy &amp;
shiny kind from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is
difficult to grind &amp; screeches on the marble.
