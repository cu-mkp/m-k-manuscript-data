Making silver run

If it is for a large work, arsenic &amp;
tartar, pulverized &amp; thrown on the melted silver, makes it run
If it is and suffices. But for fine work, one needs some
aes ustum, filings of
latten of thin copper, u
 antimony, sublimate, finely pulverized.
This From this gets made a mass that does not sour. If the s plaster is good, one ought
not to add crocum for silver, but one puts more
feather alum. It needs also some melted common
salt &amp; some saltpeter with the aforesaid drugs:
arsenic, tartar, aes ustum, copper
filings, antimony &amp;c.
