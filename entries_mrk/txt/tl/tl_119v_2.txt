Excellent secret for molding hollow and very delicately in fine
gold

Cast with your aforesaid sand your animal and lizard
or other thing with billon silver, &amp; it will come out very
neat. E But take heed to mold it hollow, or at least leave a
small hole in its mouth or in another place. Next,
gild it with fine gold, as uniform as it will be possible
for you, three or four or five times, &amp; until your gold has
the thickness of a piece of paper or something similar,
&amp; all the scales will always show equally. Next, put it in good
aquafortis, which, by this hole, will corrode the billon,
&amp; the gold will remain hollow &amp; light &amp;
wonderful.
