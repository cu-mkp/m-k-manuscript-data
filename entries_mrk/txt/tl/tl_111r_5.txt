Iron wire

You also need to have provision of different sizes,
according to the molds that you want to make; thick
like cord, smaller , &amp; thin p,
like the thick strings of a spinet, for the small works. Once de reheated, you
make clamps from it to close the
molds, &amp; points, like needles of different lengths,
according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded &amp; keep it
held down. Needles would not be good for this because their points have to be empty &amp; of the same thickness
throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as
you have need of. Iron wire is firmer than that of
latten.
