Fish glue or isinglass and
mouth glue

It is made from codfish skin, boiled rather than
being salted. Joiners glue their masterpieces
with it and guitar maker use it for delicate works.
It wants to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently in barely boiling
water.

Mouth glue is made of parchment scrapings and
one uses it without fire, for glueing paper or similar things, 
wetting it with the mouth.



One beats it and soaks it in in eau-de-vie of
vinegar white wine for one
night, then one melts it on a slow fire. Others soak
it in eau-de-vie.
