Extraction of regulus

â„ž one lb of antimony, half a lb black
soap, and half a lb of tartar from
Montpellier. Once the whole is pulverized, one needs to
boil in a varnished earthenware pot on a big fire while
stirring the whole often with a pick of wood or
iron, &amp; the said soap will be consumed and burn
off and the rest will stay as if red, and it will be necessary
that it is reduced by a third. Then one needs to cast it on a
tile and it will turn blackish. One will need to melt this four
or five times and pour it on the flat tile and then you will
have the regulus drawn from antimony.

Others pulverize the antimony &amp; mix it with
saltpeter &amp; pulverized tartar, as much of one as of
the other, &amp;, having heated a pot or crucible
red hot, they put a little of it at a time, &amp; se
turn their back for fear of the fumes, and continue thus until
everything is put in, and strengthen the fire until everything is
thoroughly melted &amp; melt it again several times.
