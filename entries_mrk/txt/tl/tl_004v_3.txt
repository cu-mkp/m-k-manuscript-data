Varnish of iron etchers

Take linseed oil or walnut oil
&amp;, in place of black pitch, you will put in a little
pitch resin, &amp; it needs to be cooked in the fashion of black
varnish on fire. And for applying it, heat your iron &amp;
give it only one layer of varnish, &amp; when it no longer
smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a steel point
whatever you want. Next take salt &amp;
verdigris &amp; mix as much of one as of the other in quite
strong vinegar &amp; leave it for xx4 hours
before using it, &amp; all will be tempered. Next spread some of this
liquor or sauce on the engraved object with a sponge








or linen &amp; leave it thus for xx4
hours &amp; it will be etched. But if you should
want to etch promptly, varnish all your work &amp; boil it in the
said liquor, &amp; it will promptly etch.
