Cleaning closed molds

One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for when hot, they retain the ash. When cold, they are cleaned better. Take a thin wire of latten or a delicate straw to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the gate. Blow into it &amp; suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
thicken the tail with wax, then cut it,

    







    





 &amp; join &amp; solder a tail of latten wire with
solder. The lumps on a flower are a small matter, for this can
be removed with the chaple, but let the leaves come
out well, then the paint covers everything.
