For preserving

Acetum paratum ex ruta baccis juniperi 
simul tusis. Eo aceto extinguantur lateres igniti et vapor excipiatur 
ore &amp; naribus.
This is to preserve oneself when one goes into infected air: a
garment can be thus perfumed &amp; removing its infection, 
the room, house, &amp;c. If you find yourself in a place where
you do not have this preparation, carry rue &amp;
seeds pestled together, then, according to
your need, boil them in vinegar and use as above.
