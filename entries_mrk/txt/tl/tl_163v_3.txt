Repairing

It is better to repair little with the burin called
onglet, or with that which one calls
chaple, or some small file. But above all,
avoid touching your work, but only the flashing or the lump that will have
occurred during the cast. And while repairing, wet &amp; rub with your
very small hog bristle brushes.
