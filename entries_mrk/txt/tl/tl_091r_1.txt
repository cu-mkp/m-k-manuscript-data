Grafting

With any tree that has coarser marrow, the graft is awkward
to estre cut well, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, &amp; if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the vine, from all
peaches &amp; apricots.

Apricot trees have a very thin bark, &amp; thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of prune trees &amp; almond trees.

The grafts scarcely  take if the cut of the tree is
damp. One needs then to graft in serain &amp; mild
weather, &amp; not too cold &amp; windy.

Old wood that one leaves to the graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made &amp; of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, &amp; if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood than the young better, because it is harder than
the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile &amp; short &amp; slow to
grow.
