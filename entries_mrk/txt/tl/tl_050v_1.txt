Small birds

Ortolans sing at night if they are left
in the serain, but they are better for fattening for
fine tables than for singing. Chaffinches are prone to becoming
blind, &amp; their eyes become swollen at the beginning of
August. Goldfinches like lettuce seeds very
much, &amp; often one catches them in gardens on seeded
lettuces with two lime-twigs. But because such regular
fare would be too expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with
hemp seed. The passe solitaire is purged
with a spider, which one needs to give to it
once a week in order that no
gaillardisse comes to it. The calandra is purged with dry
mortar, composed of lime &amp; sand to keep it from
gaillardise &amp; fattening too much. Young small
birds are purged with the same dry mortar, by putting some
pieces in their cages. The cuckoo lays in the nest of
ortolans otherwise called verdaule.
This bird is very simple. In the past, I have given leave to two of them,
which after several days returned to their cage. For feeding
young goldfinches, one needs to pestle
almonds with pith a very little amount
of bread pith and lettuce seed or
hemp seed. If it is for linnet, some
rapeseed.
