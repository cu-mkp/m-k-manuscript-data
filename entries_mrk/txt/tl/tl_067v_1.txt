Files

If they are not trempées à pacquet, that is, in the fashion
described, with soot, salt, &amp; vinegar, they
will not be good. The square large square files used
by locksmiths for their rough work are only made of
soft iron, but the soft files must be made of
steel. Founders whose work is to repair latten
&amp; copper must have their files d
coarse otherwise they would fill up with the copper which would
make them smooth &amp; soon render them useless. Latten, which is
more brittle, welcomes softer files than copper
does.
