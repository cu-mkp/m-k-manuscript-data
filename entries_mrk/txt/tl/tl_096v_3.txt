Yellow varnish

One whitens very strongly &amp; one cleans the guards well. Next,
one applies walnut olive oil all
over them with a feather while they are cold, and next turns them over a good charcoal fire that is on the
furbishersâ€™ furnace, without them touching the
charcoal or the ash. And when they do not smoke anymore,
it is done.
