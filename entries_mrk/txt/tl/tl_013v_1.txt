For knowing the good cendr√©e of azure for oil

The one that accumulates in small clods and is lumpy is
the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is very
pale in color, because oil darkens it. Certain
sophisticators mix them, but you will know this if you pour
some onto a piece of paper &amp; press it &amp; spread it with
the finger since, if it is mixed, it will be found
variegated &amp; as if striped with a pale one &amp; a darker one, but if it is
unmixed it will be even &amp; of one color.
