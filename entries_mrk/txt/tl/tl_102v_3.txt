Tin comes out better being thin &amp; fine rather than
thick, because being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore,
if you want to mold a thick piece in tin, mold it only on one
side &amp; with a cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way
you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to solder
two halves together. But if you must mold it thick, make it in the
form, &amp; mold a lot of feeders 
    

around the figure, in this way.
