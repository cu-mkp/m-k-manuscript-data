Spider’s web

It comes undone in water &amp; thus cannot be molded 
en noyau, but one casts the spider and then one draws the
drawn threads between the grass that they make in the fields
on some quarton with a point. One makes
around it an edge of paper, glued to the
quarton &amp; one casts with tin, very little
alloyed with lead.
