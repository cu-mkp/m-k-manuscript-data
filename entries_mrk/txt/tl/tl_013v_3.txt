Toadstone

The kind which comes from the head of the toad &amp; has
the figure of the toad painted naturally, as you have seen, is
the most excellent. It is held that if one puts the powder of it on a
brazier in the chamber of some persons at night, they
will be neither able to move, nor speak, nor thwart thieves.
