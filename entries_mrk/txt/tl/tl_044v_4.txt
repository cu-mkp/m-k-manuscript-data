Stucco

For glueing stone, some do not use
poi resin &amp; black pitch resin
because it is too fatty, but take rosin &amp; sulfur,
as much as of one as the other, &amp; as much of

wax as the two together, and mix it with pestled brick for greater
strength. Others, white chalk or white stone pestled &amp; pulverized
&amp; sieved.
