Foundry casting

One casts candlesticks and small works in a frame with
sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles it with
flour in order to make the e metal
copper or latten run better. When the sand has been used
for a month, it is necessary to take some new, because the one
that was used, being reheated in fire
+, dries out &amp; loses its bond. However,
it is used to mix among the new, for it makes the work not so porous.
One casts large works such as artillery, bells &amp; similar things in
earth, &amp; copper cast in earth makes less of a
crust, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The
earth is sandy clay mixed with horse dung
&amp; cloth waste. That which is has been used for
founding, which is black, cooked &amp; as if burnt, is
cast mixed with artificial sand, &amp; is
very good. / To soften &amp; make the copper run, throw in,
once it is melted, a little lead, which does not form an alloy
but is found on the surface of the cast.
