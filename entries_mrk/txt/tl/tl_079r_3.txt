For making bronze in the color of gold



Take six ounces of calcined tin &amp; as much of
natural sulfur &amp; six ounces of sal ammoniac,
and put the tin to melt in a spoon. When it is melted,
put in quicksilver, and cast it in a line, then pestle all these
drugs together in a mortar,
&amp;








and put it into an earthen pot, &amp; it should have
many hot ashes underneath, &amp; little by little you will make
the fire underneath bigger and bigger, &amp; one ought not to move it,
&amp; when it is cooked, &amp; it needs to be for six
hours, mind that the fumes do not harm you
for they are bad.
