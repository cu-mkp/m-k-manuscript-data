Crucibles

Those from Bayonne, which seem to be made of
gr√®s are better, for they last, without comparison,
longer than others. And because they are not very thick, one wastes less
charcoal melting gold &amp; silver, for they heat
quickly. They do not drink as much silver as the others,
&amp; for this reason, there is hardly any residue to be
found in them. They are less prone to tipping as others that have a
flat foot.
