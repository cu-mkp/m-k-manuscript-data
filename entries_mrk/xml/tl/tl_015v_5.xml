<ab>When some <md>defluxion</md><comment rid="c_015v_01"/> occurs there, one needs
to be very careful not to put anything inside, and according to the
proverb,<comment rid="c_015v_02"/> <md>one ought only to touch the
<bp>ear</bp> &amp; the <bp>eye</bp> with the <bp>elbow</bp></md>. However, it
is good to put on an affected <bp>ear</bp> <m>musked cotton</m>, that is
to say, kept in <m>musk</m>, for it <md>comforts quite well</md>.</ab>
