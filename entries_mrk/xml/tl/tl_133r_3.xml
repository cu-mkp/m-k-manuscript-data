<head>Marks from the <tl>points of <m>iron wire</m></tl> which are found
on the head of the animal</head>

<ab><del><fr>L</fr></del> With the <tl>points</tl>, one has previously
set the stance, especially that of the head. But the head being pierced,
there remains around the hole some moisture and a little exudation,
which hinders the <m>sand</m> from covering the <tl>point</tl> &amp; there
always remains some little opening <del><fr>g</fr></del>. But to avoid
this, you can plant <add>in the slab of earth</add> an
<tl><m>iron</m> point</tl>, <del><fr>arro</fr></del> cleaned &amp;
rounded at the top end, &amp; on this end place there a little <m>hard
wax</m> or <del><fr>du</fr></del> a little <m>mastic</m> or
<m>cement</m> and, by means of the <tl>hot <m>iron</m>
wire</tl>, hold in place the throat of the animal, which can be removed
when you come to uncover the belly &amp; the throat to make the second
cast.</ab>
