<tl><m>glass</m> vial</tl> not too big and put into it a half of these
two, namely two &amp; a half <ms>ounces</ms>. Next take the said
<m>benzoin just as coarsely <tl>pestled</tl></m>, and put it to use with the
said <m>water</m> and let it rest for the space of one &amp; half
<ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>, &amp; then take the said <m>water</m> &amp;
put it into another <tl><m>glass</m> vial</tl> &amp; mix it very well.
And on the rest of the said <m>benzoin</m> that remains at the bottom of
the said first <tl>vial</tl>, put the rest of the <m>water</m> over this,
and do as before when you see that the case is going well, and mix the
first <m>water</m> with the second. By means of this you will be able to
use it for something more noble.</ab>
