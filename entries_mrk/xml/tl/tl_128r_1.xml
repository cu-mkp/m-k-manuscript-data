<head>Casting in <m>silver</m> and <m>gold</m></head>

<ab>

Wanting to melt, always put for these two <m>metals</m>
a <m>small stone of pulverized borax</m> at the bottom of
the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> &amp; the <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> on top.
This makes it so that if the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> gives off some vapor or
sour fumes, it will not impair these two <tl>metals</tl>. For
<m>gold</m> in particular, this is good.</ab>

<ab>

If you have several <m>molds</m> to cast, do not think of filling them
in one cast, for the <m>metal</m> would be cold. But having cast while
hot &amp; filling one, remelt &amp; cast in the other. </ab>

<ab>When your <tl>mold</tl> starts to redden on the inside, <del>&amp;
when the cast</del> <del>loses its blackness,</del> <del>then put your</del> &amp; when
looking inside <add>the cast</add> you <del>you</del> do not see
<del><fr>plas</fr></del> <add>a single point</add> of blackness,
continue to maintain it in this heat &amp;, if need be, add in some half-lit charcoals with your <tl>pincers</tl>. However,
<del><fr>com</fr></del> put <add>in the <tl>forge</tl></add> your
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> with a little <m>ground borax</m> at the bottom, &amp;
the <m>silver</m> that you want to cast <del>in your
<tl>forge</tl></del> <add>should be on top</add>, letting your
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> reheat between the lit charcoals
<del><fr>jus</fr></del> <del>without blowing</del> until it is red, for
before, one ought not to blow. And when you do blow, push in a longish
&amp; continuous movement the <tl>bellows</tl>, giving them a little
shake when pushing &amp; another when pulling toward you. In this way,
the heat becomes stronger. <del><fr>Com</fr></del>
<del><fr>Ne</fr></del>Take heed to raise sometimes your
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> <del>with the</del> with hot <tl>pincers</tl>, 
because<del><fr>il</fr></del><comment rid="c_128r_02"/> <add>if it</add> is placed right in front of the

<del><add>wind builds the</add></del> wind of the <tl>bellows</tl> hits
the <tl>crucible</tl>, it will cool your <m>silver</m> rather than
heating it. Make sure that the lit charcoals support it from above the
<tl>blast-pipe</tl>, &amp; take care that it is at a distance of
three <ms>good <bp>fingers</bp></ms> from the wall of the
<tl>forge</tl>. In this way, it heats better. Therefore, when your
<m>silver</m> starts to melt, if you recognize that it is brittle,
seeing cracked &amp; burst lumps, take the <ms>size of a
<pa>hazelnut</pa></ms> of <m>arsenic &amp; <ms>two times as much</ms> of
raw tartar, coarsely pulverized</m>, for in this way, they have more
ability to heat. And occasionally throw it in the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> on the
<m>silver</m>, which clarifies it. But if you have some of that crust sublimated on a <m>metal</m> substance, which looks like
grain of <m>steel</m>, as previously described,<comment rid="c_128r_01"/> take a little
of that, leaving <add><mark>#</mark></add> the others, &amp; throw it
on your <m>melted silver</m>.</ab>

<ab>

You will see that it will torment it &amp; heat it very well and soon
render it very liquid &amp; ready to cast and be clarified, as it should
be. When it is in this state &amp; when it is very white and polished,
shining like <m>quicksilver</m>, prepare yourself to cast. And to this
effect, have some <m>lean delicate sand</m>, in a
<tl><fr>terrine</fr></tl> or another <tl>vessel</tl>, that you would
like to help yourself to. Make a pit in your <m>sand</m>, then, with your
<tl>pincers</tl>, take your <tl>well-reddened mold</tl> &amp; place it
in this pit of <m>sand</m>. Cover immediately the opening of your <tl>mold
</tl>in order that no <m>ash </m>&amp; dust enters inside, &amp; then
enclose it with <m>sand</m> up to the edge of the gate &amp; the vents. This done,
uncover your <tl>mold </tl>&amp; throw on top of your <m>well-melted
silver</m>, the <ms>size of a <pa>pea</pa></ms> or thereabouts, some
of this metallic grain, which will immediately spread through
all your <m>silver</m> &amp; make it boil &amp; turn. Cast as soon as
you have put in this substance, for it is this that is the secret to
making the <m>silver </m>run, since its crust heats it &amp; clarifies
it. You can cast <m>silver finer than the alloy from the <pl>capital
</pl>and like that of the <cn>real</cn></m>, but you must add this
grain in.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


With all of this, do not let yourself forget to put, before all things,
a little <m>borax </m>in the <m>melted silver</m>, for even though
<pro>goldsmiths</pro> do not put any in, nevertheless it is good, and I have
seen it practised well. Next, one puts in the crust of the substance at
two different times &amp; then the metallic thing. Then make sure <ill/> that
it be placed at the end of your <tl>forge</tl>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


If you want to blow the <m>ash</m> that is around your <tl>mold</tl> when
you hold it between the <tl>pincers</tl>, hold it with the opening at
the bottom, &amp; blow.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


When <m>silver</m> is well melted, you can uncover it and blow with the
<tl>small bellows</tl>, not continually like with <m>gold</m>, but only
to cast out the <m>charcoals</m> in order to put in the substances that
make it run.</ab>
