<head>Molding and shrinking a large figure</head>

<ab>

Mold it with <m>bread pith</m> coming from the <tl>oven</tl>, or
as the aforesaid, &amp; in drying out, it will shrink &amp; consequently the
medal that you will cast in it. You <del>it</del> can, by this means, by
elongating and widening the imprinted <m>bread pith</m>, vary the figure
&amp; with one image make many various ones. <m>Bread</m> coming from
the <tl>oven</tl> is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts
more. You can cast <m>sulfur</m> without leaving the imprint of the
<m>bread</m> to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you
want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.<hr/></ab>
