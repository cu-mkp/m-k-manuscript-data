<ab>Those that <del>can</del> are taken <tmp>at <pn>St. Michael</pn></tmp> are
good for keeping, but those that are taken in <tmp>March</tmp> die,
because they are starting to fall into love. <oc><al>Ortolans</al></oc>
are fed on <pa>oats</pa> <tmp>all summer</tmp> in order that they are nourished without becoming
fat, to be more appropriate for hunting &amp; catching others.
Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them
<pa>millet</pa>. They sing <tmp>at night</tmp>. One needs to
<del><fr>c</fr></del> take them <tmp>after mid-July until
<pn>St. Michael</pn></tmp>, for after that time when they have their young in
this country, they go away like <al>turtledoves</al> do. <al>Siskins</al>
should also be taken <ms><tmp>from All Saintsâ€™ Day until
Christmas</tmp></ms>, for after that they go to the <env>mountains</env> to
brood.
