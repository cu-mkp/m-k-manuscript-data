<head>For unspiking a <wp>cannon</wp></head>

<ab>Some say that one should remove the ball if the <wp>cannon</wp> is loaded
&amp; give fire through the mouth of the <wp>cannon</wp>. But it is to be
believed that the fire would sooner exit that way than going to seek its
exit through its usual touch-hole which is
spiked &amp; constrained. The most reliable way is that the
<pro>gunner</pro>, who is often a <pro>founder</pro>, wedges &amp;
thoroughly rivets the <tl>nail</tl> that the enemies placed, and with a
<tl>trepan</tl> makes <del>at the side</del> another touch-hole next to
the one which has been spiked, which will be done in an hour. And if
with time the violence of the <m>powder</m> loosens the <m>nail</m> with
which the <wp>piece</wp> is spiked, you will make a <tl>thread</tl> in the second
touch-hole &amp; place a <tl>screw</tl> in it quite perfectly which will
never come undone. <del><fr>M</fr></del></ab></div>
