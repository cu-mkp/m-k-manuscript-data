<ab>It is good that the jaws of the <tl><oc>vise</oc></tl> should be high to make
a long piece in it, and that the jaws join well to clamp a delicate
object. To <m>solder</m> the <tl>nut</tl>, after you have forged the
<tl>bolt</tl>, you <del>will make</del> will forge a long <m>iron
strip</m> <del><fr>quar</fr></del> of such thickness that it can fit
into the notch of the <tl>bolt</tl> when red hot, &amp; you will bend it
<del><fr>po</fr></del> all around, striking it with a <tl>hammer</tl>.
Once it is well <del><fr>jo</fr></del> wrapped around, you will insert
<del>it</del> the <tl>bolt</tl> <del><fr>o</fr></del> around which
<del>is</del> it is wrapped.</ab>
