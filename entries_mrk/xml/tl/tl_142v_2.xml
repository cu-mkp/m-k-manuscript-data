<ab>Make the notches from those that enter more into the inside of the
<tl>mold</tl> than on the outside, for in this way, they have more
strength. Keep from reheating in one go &amp; in too ardent a fire, for
this makes them <del>melt</del> break.</ab>

<ab margin="right-middle">Do not keep them in a <env>humid or
enclosed place</env> if they are not quite dry, for they go moldy. So do
dried animals.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">One ought not to reheat <tl>molds</tl>
twice when the animal can be removed without burning, like a
<al>toad</al>, which can well be molded hollow like all thick animals.
However, it is always good to redden the <tl>mold</tl> once.</ab>
