If there is not enough good <m>feather alum</m> or
<m><la>crocum</la></m>, it will easily crack in the fire. But if it is
mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. It is recognized to be
good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes <m>water</m>
when one quenches it &amp; <del>rends</del> breaks
easily because the <m>alum</m> &amp; the <m><la>crocum</la></m> render
it spongy. On the contrary, <m>bad sand</m>, which is only of <m>plaster</m> &amp;
<m>brick</m>, &amp; little mixed with <m>alum</m>, breaks easily in the
fire &amp; hardens in <m>water</m>. Cast, if possible, all in one
go.</ab>
