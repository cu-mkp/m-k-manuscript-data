<ab>If they are not <fr>trempées à pacquet</fr>, that is, in the fashion
described, with <m>soot</m>, <m>salt</m>, &amp; <m>vinegar</m>, they
will not be good. The <del>square</del> large <tl>square files</tl> used
by <pro>locksmiths</pro> for their rough work are only made of
<m>soft iron</m>, but the <tl>soft files</tl> must be made of
<m>steel</m>. <pro>Founders</pro> whose work is to repair <m>latten</m>
&amp; <m>copper</m> must have their <tl>files</tl> <del><fr>d</fr></del>
coarse otherwise they would fill up with the <m>copper</m> which would
make them smooth &amp; soon render them useless. <m>Latten</m>, which is
more brittle, welcomes softer <tl>files</tl> than <m>copper</m>
does.</ab>
