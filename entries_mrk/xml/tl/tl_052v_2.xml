<head>Colors</head>

<ab>If you want to keep them beautiful in <m>gum</m> and such that they
do not lose any of their true color, put <m>white wine</m>, the
whitest and clearest you can, in a <tl>bottle</tl> with a little
<m>tragacanth gum</m>. And having <tl>stoppered</tl> the
<tl>bottle</tl>, scramble &amp; shake it very strongly together, &amp;
let it rest until the <m>tragacanth</m> is dissolved. Also put in a
little fine-grained <m>white salt</m> to brighten the whole.
Some mix <m>clear water</m> with <m>white wine</m>, and with this
mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
beautifully in <pro>illumination</pro> work.</ab></div>
