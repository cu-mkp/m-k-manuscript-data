<ab>They assemble <m>silver filings</m> with <m>saltpeter</m> which
refines it &amp; does not make it brittle. But <m>gold filings</m> are
assembled with <m>borax</m> or, to save the <m>borax</m>, with
<m>lead</m>, which refines the <m>gold</m> &amp; softens it, for the
<m>saltpeter</m> would make it brittle, which <m>silver</m> does not do.
This is why, to save money, <pro>goldsmiths</pro> use it to assemble, in
order to save <m>borax</m>, which costs viii <cn>sous</cn> per
<ms>ounce</ms>, &amp; <m>saltpeter</m> x <cn>sous</cn> per
<ms>lb</ms>.</ab>

<ab>When <pro>goldsmiths</pro> have thus assembled their <m>silver
filings</m> with <m>saltpeter</m>, a <m>red enamel</m> vitrifies at the
bottom of the <tl>crucible</tl>. I do not know if the <m>copper</m>
mixed in with the <m>silver</m> is the cause. <emph>Try for
<m>enamel</m></emph>.</ab>
