<ab>When the color has dried inside, &amp; you want to clean them, soak
them in <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> and they immediately will
turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>. <m><pa>Walnut</pa> oil</m> is not <del>as
not</del> as appropriate to soften them as that of <m><pa>spike
lavender</pa></m>, which is clear like <m>water</m> &amp; penetrates
&amp; does not have body like <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>. The <tl>handle
of paintbrushes</tl> is made by those who work with
care from <m><al>porcupine</al> quills</m>,
by others from <m><m>wood</m> of arrows from <pl>Turkey</pl></m>
<del>with whom</del> with which they also make <tl>small rods to rest
their <bp>hand</bp> when they are painting</tl>.</ab>

To work well on a small scale <tl>very thin paintbrushes which
have a firm point</tl> are<del><fr>on</fr></del><comment rid="c_058v_04"/> needed. And because a 
<m><al>squirrel</al>’s tail hair</m> is soft,
the most careful take the <m>bristles of the oldest <al>rats</al></m>,
especially of <al>dormice</al> if they can find them, &amp; put two or
three of them in the middle of the <tl>paintbrush</tl>. These make
a straight line like a <tl><m>quill</m></tl> &amp; all the other
<m>hairs</m> of the <tl>paintbrush</tl> stick to them as to the
point. The <m>bristles of <al>beech martens</al> &amp; <al>weasels</al>
&amp; small animals that make <m>musk</m></m> are even better, for a
single <m>hair</m> in a <tl>paintbrush</tl> suffices.</ab>

<ab><m>Lake</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m> &amp; <m>ceruse</m> are easy to
work in <m>oil</m>, but every kind of <m>azure</m> is difficult. And to
make beautiful <m>azure</m>, one needs to layer it not with large
strokes of the <tl>paintbrush</tl> but with small strokes of the
point. Not only <m>ash</m> &amp;
    <m><fr>azur d’<pl>Acre</pl></fr></m><comment rid="c_059r_02"/> but mainly <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m>
which one needs to choose to be very delicate, <del>for it</del>
otherwise you will not <del><fr>v</fr></del> be able to work with it
except with much work, and even then you need to allay it with
<m>turpentine</m> to give it body, and mix it with a little <m>lead
white</m>. Any <m>azure</m> wants neither to be ground nor washed for it
loses color &amp; becomes pale. But putting it powdered on your
<tl>palette</tl>, you will thin it little by little either with
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> or <m>turpentine oil</m>,
dipping a <tl>knife point</tl> in the <m>oil</m>, then
tempering it little by little on the said
<tl>palette</tl>.</ab></div>
