<ab>If your <al>snake</al> has been without eating for a <tmp>long time</tmp>, it
happens that, when you want to put it to death in <m><bp>urine</bp></m> &amp;
<m>vinegar</m>, it fills with a lot of <m>water</m> &amp; swells, and
next it dries out as you fix &amp; arrange it on the <m>clay</m>
<po>cake</po>, and next it happens that when you have cast your
<del><tl>mold</tl></del> <m>tempered sand</m> on it, &amp; it has set, it
ends up coming out such that between the <al>snake</al> and animal there
is a <ms>line</ms> of distance <del><fr>D</fr></del>, in which enters
the second batch of cast <m>tempered sand</m> <del><fr>M</fr></del>. Avoid this,
therefore, if you can. But if this cannot be, do not let this prevent
your second cast, for the <m>sand</m> which will enter in this void will be so
weak that it will easily be removed with a <tl>small point</tl> &amp;
will not have set with the first hardened one.</ab>

<ab>Note that one needs more <m>feather alum</m> for
<tl>molds</tl> that should be reheated, like those for <m>gold</m>
&amp; <m>silver</m> &amp; things that one needs to burn inside than for those which release well &amp; that are only for casting
<m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>. However, do not put too much in either one. </ab>
