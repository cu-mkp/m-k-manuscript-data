<head><m>Verdigris</m> and another very beautiful bright green</head>

<ab>One ought not to grind it with <m>water</m> alone, for that makes it
die. To render it beautiful in <m>distemper</m>, some grind it with
<m>vinegar</m>, but that makes it turn pale &amp; become whitish. To
render it beautiful, grind it with <m><bp>urine</bp></m> &amp; leave to dry.
Then, whenever you like, grind it with <m>oil</m>. And after you have
collected it with the <tl>spatula</tl>, before finishing to clean the
<tl><m>marble</m></tl>, grind <m>stil de grain yellow</m> on it. And you
will have a very beautiful green.</ab>
