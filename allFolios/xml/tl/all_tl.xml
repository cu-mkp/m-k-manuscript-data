beautiful <m>clear pitch resin</m> and put in one <ms>ounce</ms> of
<m>subtly ground vermilion</m> with <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>, and if
you add in a little <m><pl>Venice</pl> <fr>laque platte</fr></m>, the
color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the <m>resin</m> melted
over a <m>charcoal</m> fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. 
Next dip in your branches while turning, &amp; if any filaments
should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of the
<m>charcoal</m>.</ab>

&amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid like

<head>For varnishing</head>

<ab><m>Turpentine varnish</m> does not need any <m>glue</m> because it
is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the <m>wood</m> like that
of <m>spike lavender</m> &amp; <m>sandarac</m>. Also, that of <m>spike
lavender</m> does not require any <m>glue</m> on <m>iron</m> &amp;
similar things that do not absorb. But on <m>wood</m> &amp; on colors
which <del>have</del> <add>do not have</add> <m>gum</m> or 
<m>distemper glue</m>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
<m>hide glue</m> &amp; to let it dry &amp; to
varnish.</ab>

<div id="p004r_1" categories="varnish">



<head><m>Varnish of spike lavender oil</m></head>

<ab>One needs to heat <m>spike lavender oil</m> &amp; as it begins to
simmer, put in <m>powdered sandarac gum</m> so that it soon melts. And
over a <m>charcoal</m> fire stir continuously until the <m>sandarac</m>
is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
<m>varnish</m> on a <tl>plate</tl>, and if it is fatty when you handle
it with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, it is ready. And for one <ms>lb</ms>
of <m>spike lavender oil</m>, you will put five <ms>ounces</ms> of
<m>pulverized sandarac</m>, although some only put in four
<ms>ounces</ms>, but this is neither so good nor so fatty. This one is
promptly dry. <pro>Frame makers</pro>, to avoid the trouble of polishing
their <m>ebony</m>, varnish it with this, as do <pro><mu>guitar</mu> makers</pro>.
This is not as appropriate for panels as that of <m>fine turpentine</m>,
though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not use to
varnish the landscape of a panel when <m>linseed varnish</m> was in use,
because it yellowed the landscape. But with that of
<m>turpentine</m>, one varnishes everywhere. You can put in
<m>pulverized mastic</m> extracted in tears or otherwise, &amp; it will be
more desiccative, in place of <m>sandarac</m>.</ab>

<ab>If you want to varnish on <m>plaster</m> or a wall, first put on
your very hot <m>hide glue</m>, because if were cold it
would not penetrate the wall, &amp; when you would put your
<m>varnish</m> on, it would come off.</ab>

<ab><mark>X</mark><comment rid="c_084v_02"/> They are called of <m>steel</m> because in times
past they were commonly made of <m>steel</m> polished with
<tl><m>emery putty</m></tl>. But more easily, various kinds are made
with <df><m><fr>cuivre franc</fr></m></df>, which is <m>rosette</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m>, because it is cast in a <tl>mold</tl> &amp; made
round, concave, convex &amp; however one likes, to represent various
forms.</ab>
    

<ab>So take <ms>half</ms> <m>rosette copper</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms>
<df><m>soft tin</m></df>, that is to say fine, which has not yet been used.
Put them in a <tl>crucible</tl>, &amp; first melt the <m>copper</m>
well. And once it is well melted, put in the <m>tin</m> and mix
together. Then cast in the <tl>mold, of <m>white stone</m> with no
eyelets</tl>, &amp; anoint the <tl>mold</tl> with <m>oil</m>, &amp; let
it be moderately warm. Then, having
<tl>molded</tl> your mirror, you can polish it in this way.</ab>

<ab>Set one of these in <m>plaster</m> in order that it holds firmly,
&amp; then put the other one over it with <tl><m>thin sand</m></tl> in between,
&amp; rub one against the other, whether it be concave or flat, &amp; thus you
will polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides,
you only need to switch them, that is to say put the one that was
polishing into the <m>plaster</m> &amp; the one that was in the
<m>plaster</m> to polish. After having polished them with the
<tl><m><fr>arene</fr></m></tl> you can smooth them with <tl><m><pl>Venice</pl> tripoli</m></tl>,

<head>Painting <m><fr>esmail d’azur</fr></m> in <m>oil</m></head>

cause the <m>azure</m>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the
panel flat &amp; put down the <m>azure</m> on it, which is also done
in distemper. The main thing is to grind it well on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl>, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly.
Some grind it <del>with</del> thoroughly with an <m>egg yolk</m> &amp;
then wash it in five or six <m>waters</m> and lay it
on not with a <tl>paintbrush</tl>, which would be too soft, but
with a <tl>brush</tl> thoroughly softened &amp; crimped,
&amp; layering it thickly as if one were putting it down with a

experienced that grinding <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m> with <m>egg
yolk</m> &amp; next washing it in several <m>waters</m> is
good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it.
I have also washed it in several <m>waters</m> &amp;, when it
had settled a little, I removed the <m>water</m>, still
<del>q</del> blue, with a <tl>sponge</tl> and squeezed it into another

<ab>To make <m>azures</m> beautiful, they wash or soak them in a

is natural, others say that it is a secret of <pro>ancient lapidaries</pro>
that is lost, others say that it is <m>refired enamel</m>. And by means
of the said crust, several ciphers, letters, circles
<del><fr>st</fr></del> &amp; other bizarre things can be formed. As for
the method, I have practiced it thus. Once I wished to give it a layer of
<m>arsenic</m> ground on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>. However, I experimented
without this, and I put the aforesaid thing, <m>enilanroc</m>, in a
small <tl><m>iron</m> casket</tl> on the fire of my
<tl><pro>goldsmith</pro>’s forge</tl> with three or four small
half-burnt <m>charcoals</m>, and blew only with my <bp>mouth</bp>. And
nonetheless the thing came to <del>redden &amp;</del> ignition &amp; turned
completely white, not only on its surface but also inside, &amp; then I
let it cool on its own <env>near the fire</env>, for otherwise, exposing
it suddenly to cold air, it would have burst. Once all white, I passed
it through my <tl><add><m>lead</m></add><comment rid="c_012v_01"/> <del><m>tin</m></del> wheel</tl>, 
where I found it as hard as before, &amp; uncovering the white
a little, I found it a fair flesh color. Finally, I polished it &amp;
saw that it took a very beautiful polish &amp; could paragon a
very beautiful <m>agate</m> for cutting some beautiful face on it &amp;
bringing it on <del>the</del> a table of

<m>agate</m> of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made an opening in
a <m>brick</m> of the exact size of the thing &amp; put it inside. Then
I reddened two <tl><pro>glassworkers’</pro>
solders</tl>, &amp; as they were red, I
presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I
had the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I
wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a <tl><m>diamond</m>
point</tl>, and I polished it with <tl>small <m><al>hog</al> bristle</m> brushes</tl>
and <tl><m>tripoli</m></tl>. I do not know if it would be better to
reheat it under hot <m>ashes</m>, &amp; if it would be good to encase it
in <m>alabaster</m>, which is very cold, as I encased it in the
<m>brick</m>.</ab>

<head>For walls of <m>earth</m> and rustic construction<comment rid="c_014r_01"/></head>

<ab><al>Swallows</al> have taught us this craft, making their nests out
of <m>mud</m> mixed with <m>wisps</m> &amp; <m>stalks of hay or
straw</m> to make it bond. Therefore, in places where <m>stone</m> &amp;
<m>brick</m> are lacking, one can use <m>earth</m> to make partitions
&amp; walls. And for this, <m>light earth</m>, which does not
form clumps when plowed, but which is as if intermixed with
<m><fr>arene</fr></m>, holds first rank, because it can be beaten &amp;
tamped down better. It is true that one needs to moisten it &amp;
<del><fr>la</fr></del> cut it into the shape of sods with a <tl><po>ditch-spade</po></tl>, and
thus place &amp; arrange it. This one lasts longer and there is not as much
construction work, and <del>not</del> dryness does not make it
crack &amp; split. But, because such kinds of <m>earth</m> are not found
everywhere, those who are on <env>good &amp; fertile land</env>, after
marking out with a <tl>measuring line</tl> the width &amp; length of
their foundations, drive <del>into the ground</del> in along the edges,

<head>On the <pro>gunner</pro></head>

<ab>

The <wp>cannon</wp> fires at point-blank from five to six hundred <ms>paces</ms>.
But not for battering, in which it can only perform well from two
hundred <ms>paces</ms>, or three hundred <del><ms>paces</ms></del> at
the most, and it should not be any farther. Its ball commonly weighs 40
<ms>lb</ms> of the <ms><pro>King</pro>’s caliber</ms>. There is
a <df><wp>cannon-perrier</wp></df>, which weighs xxv <ms>quintals</ms>, which are
<wp>small, short cannons</wp>. It is for fighting the <env>ditch casemates</env>
&amp; for battering at close range. It bears a large ball of the
<ms><pro>King</pro>’s caliber</ms> like the others, namely of
40 <ms>lb</ms>. It bears in the breech only the <ms>width of two balls
&amp; a quarter of a ball</ms>. The front only bears the <ms>width of
one ball &amp; a third of a ball</ms>. Its charge is similar to those of
bigger ones, namely xx <ms>lb</ms>. And for this reason, when one wants to try them
<del><ill/></del>, one ought not to over-charge it, for this damages the
<wp>piece</wp>. And for the first time &amp; until it has fired five or six
<del>pieces</del> shots, it is better not to give its complete charge,
for the <wp>piece</wp> is still proving itself. And the test that one can do is
to give it a charge of xx <ms>lb</ms> of <m>fine <wp>arquebus</wp> powder</m>
instead of <m>ordinary <wp>cannon</wp> powder</m>. And four good <al>horses</al>
are sufficient to drag them. They are easy, &amp; close up they have as
much force as the big ones, especially for <env>private houses</env>
&amp; <env>small towns</env> &amp; <env>fortresses of little
importance</env>. They are no more subject to bursting than the others
because they are short. For that which gives great strength to the
<m>powder</m> &amp; puts <add>the <wp>piece</wp></add> in danger of bursting is
the length of the <wp>piece</wp>, because the <m>powder</m> is burned entirely
before exiting, &amp; <del>the</del> its impetuosity is held constrained
for <tmp>longer</tmp> in a <del>small</del> <wp>long piece</wp> than a
<del><fr>gr</fr></del> short one. The <wp>cannon-perrier</wp> is commonly seven to

point at which you aim. Then take your sight from the top of the breech,
which will be done quickly. Next, lower your <wp>piece</wp> a little at your

<ab>Some keep their <wp>pieces</wp> loaded <del>and</del> from the day. Then, in

assailed are perhaps making repairs, the besiegers raise a false alarm

fire</tl> into the moats or around the breach, at which the
<pro>gunner</pro> aims. Sometimes, by using the reflection of

light up the breach. The method you know, with a <tl>quadrant</tl> &amp;
<tl><m>plumb</m> line</tl>, is very good. Others nail two or three rows
of boards with <m>strong iron pegs</m> on the <m>wooden</m> platform
made for mounting the <wp>cannon</wp>, and leave empty notches into which the
wheels of the <wp>cannon</wp> can just fit. And by such means you will always
<del><fr>te</fr></del> place it at a similar <del><fr>q</fr></del>
point, that it will not incline more to the right than to the left. And
in order that it be neither too high nor too low, when you fire during
the day, you place a <tl>ruler</tl> fixed well in the ground, which
comes just to touch the the bottom of the edge of the <wp>cannon</wp> after it
has been pointed &amp; adjusted for firing.</ab>

<ab>There are three reinforcement rings on a <wp>cannon</wp>, one at the breech,
one in the middle, one at the mouth. When <pro>founders</pro> want to work on their
craft or render the <wp>cannon</wp> or other <wp>piece</wp> lighter &amp; easier <add>to
cart around</add>, they make it from the ring at the breech to the ring
in the middle of the thickness &amp; proportion of the balls, as is said
above. But from the ring in the middle to the ring of the mouth
<del>&amp;</del> they diminish it one <ms>line</ms>, or more or less, on
each side, always taking their measurements with the <tl>compass</tl>
<add>from</add> the straight line which they make in the middle of the
<tl>model of <m>paper</m></tl> or otherwise. And this reduction amounts
to seven or eight <ms>quintals</ms> <del>reduction &amp;
lightening</del> <add>in weight</add>, and the <wp>piece</wp> is not less secure
for it. This is done for <wp>big pieces</wp>, but for <del><fr>gr</fr></del>
<wp>small pieces</wp> <del>from</del> <add>lesser than</add> the average, one
needs to observe the aforesaid proportion, &amp; draw the <wp>piece</wp> in a
continuous line from one end to the other. The trunnions are commonly
situated one <bp><ms>foot</ms></bp> from the ring of the middle,
<del>from</del> toward the edge of the breech.

But because some <pro>gunners</pro> prefer a <wp>piece</wp> which is weighted at the front
because it is easier to plant, to do this, one only needs to move the
trunnions closer to the breech &amp; further away from the middle. On
the contrary, if you want to render it <del><fr>s</fr></del>
<add>more</add> weighted at the back, you will move the trunnions

closer to the middle of the <wp>piece</wp> or place them further up toward the
mouth. When you bore your <wp>piece</wp> you make a fluted <m>cast iron</m> box
like a bedpost &amp; there ought to be sixteen channels or notches in
which you will slot sixteen <tl>blades</tl> quite evenly,
<del>with</del> in order that all together they cut &amp; scrape in the
same manner. Because if some were to not cut &amp; scrape, chambers
&amp; waves would be made in the <wp>cannon</wp> which would make it lopsided and
there would be a danger that the <wp>piece</wp> might break in the middle. In
order to avoid this, it is necessary that the <tl>borer</tl> should pass
evenly from the breech to the mouth, &amp; that the opening of the <wp>piece</wp>
should be evenly bored from one end to the other, because thus the
<m>powder</m> goes off all at once with more force. On the contrary, if
restrained, it goes sideways &amp; makes the <wp>piece</wp> break.</ab></div>

<ab>Take <m>tragacanth gum</m> and put it to soak until, having drunk
its <m>water</m>, it is swollen &amp; rendered like <m>jelly</m>. Then
grind it quite hard on <tl><m>marble</m></tl> &amp; next take
<m><pa>rye</pa> flour</m>, which is better than <m><pa>wheat</pa></m>
because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and
sprinkle your <m>tragacanth gum</m> with it, &amp; continue to grind
<add>and mix in</add> thus, little by little, <del>it and mix
<fr>legi</fr></del> the very finely sieved <m>flour</m>. And knead it as if
you wanted to make <m>bread</m>, until <del>you</del> you perceive that
it has enough body &amp; is as firm as <m>bread dough</m> that one is
ready to put in the <tl>oven</tl>. This is recognized when it can
stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it
would not <del><fr>sti</fr></del> release well. Once the paste is prepared, rub
the hollow form <del>at the <fr>u</fr></del> with <m>oil</m>, with a
<tl>brush</tl>, in order that the <m>oil</m> penetrates everywhere to make it
release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does
not release well, mix in more <m>flour</m> until it has enough body.
With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which
will be dry within one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms>. Next, you will apply them with
<m>strong glue</m> or <m>paste glue</m>, as you like, and you will be
able to paint and decorate them with <m>gold</m> &amp; all colors. One
makes ceiling ornaments with it in <pl>Rome</pl>. One can make bed
ornaments with it. <emph>If you want that the work stays white</emph>, it
is better to mold with <m>plaster</m> instead of <m>flour</m>. It is
true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare
it like this: temper it, when it is powdered <del>strong</del>, in a
good amount of <m>water</m> so that it is <add>clear</add>, &amp; grind
it several <ms>times</ms> a <tmp>day</tmp> for fifteen <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Then pour off the
<m>water</m> by tilting, and gather the <m>plaster</m> &amp; grind it
finely on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, &amp; place it in some kind of
clean <tl><m>lead</m> vessel</tl>, so that no dust &amp; dirt falls into
it, &amp; leave it <env>in the open air</env> &amp; <env>in the <fr>serain</fr></env> 
for fifteen <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> with its <m>water</m>, and
it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making
a seat for burnished <m>gold</m>. And this, in powder form, you
can mix, instead of <m>flour</m>, with <m>tragacanth gum</m>, and your
work will be very beautiful. Lacking <m>plaster</m>, you can mix in well
ground <m>chalk</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, &amp; try <m>bole</m> &amp;
similar things. This <m>stucco</m> with the <m>tragacanth gum</m> has
the quality that, yielding when it is not yet dry, it can be accommodated on either
round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little
expense.

thicker at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for

judge the proportions. Once the first drawing seems good to you, retrace

something fine &amp; thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as

well, place your <tl>crucible</tl> as low as possible &amp; at the very

to maintain the <m>charcoal</m> between the <tl>bellows</tl> &amp; the

increments &amp; drop by drop, which would stop &amp; plug up the
conduit of the substance. And if you were to make in the cast a
trough to feed the medal, it would be even better. And in order

Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other</head>

<ab>

It is necessary to cast two pieces of <m>copper</m>, <m>latten</m> or
similar <m>metal</m>, very neatly, and then when you have molded the
hollow form in the <m>sand</m>, leave the figure of <m>metal</m> that you

from its place. And cast, &amp; if there is not enough thickness press a
little &amp; push the figure down in the <tl>frame</tl>.</ab>

<ab>

It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
the entry of the medal, &amp; there, where the force is, the
<m>filth</m> &amp; <m>grime</m> accumulate. And, in this way, if you
were mold the face toward the cast, some <m>grime</m> could be found
there, &amp; it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
to repair.</ab>

<m>Vinegar</m> is better for moistening than <m>wine</m>. It is

<del>And that the cast be</del> as you press on one side, the other one

the <m>coarse sand</m>, which is humid, communicate its humidity to the

<ab>The first thing the <pro>apprentice</pro> does is to furbish as
said.</ab>

<ab>And next, to garnish the <wp>sword</wp> &amp; make a scabbard, which is the

<ab>They buy the <m>wood</m> pieces of

<fr>talan</fr>,<comment rid="c_096r_02"/> and the shorter the better.
Without this scraping, the <wp>sword</wp> would always cut the scabbard.</ab>

<ab>

The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth, &amp; on top is the
shape of the blade.<comment rid="c_096r_03"/></ab>

<ab>

The stop, which is a <m>leather</m> rim set on the edge of the blade
shape,<comment rid="c_096r_04"/> is made to stop the hangers.</ab>

<ab>

When the <fr>estelles</fr> are well levelled, one lays the <wp>sword</wp> on top,

blade &amp; the length, &amp; then with a <tl>chisel</tl>, one cuts the
excess. And one passes a <tl>joiner’s plane</tl> to even it
well, according to the mark.</ab>

Next, one glues the two <fr>estoilles</fr> edge to edge <add>and all
around</add>, only as far as the shape of the blade extends &amp; not
elsewhere. And this is to make the <m>leather</m> or <m>velvet</m> of

Then one puts the <wp>sword</wp> into the <fr>estelles</fr>. And precisely thus,
they set it in the scabbard, which is all sewn, and rub what is

sewn between <m>leather</m> &amp; <m>flesh</m>, &amp; then they rub the
stitching thoroughly with a piece of <tl><m><pa>boxwood</pa></m></tl> to

one does not leave it there for long. Next, the same
<pro>worker who made the <m>wood</m> piece</pro> has to adjust the
scabbard to be well made. It is true that for <pro>common people</pro>,
one may well get ones which are ready made, but they are never carried

one rubs it with a piece of <tl><m><pa>boxwood</pa></m></tl> or with a
<tl>cloth</tl>, having daubed it a little in <m>oil</m>. The scabbard of
a good <al>cow</al> is better than any and also costs more, except the
<m>velvet</m> kind. Under the <m>velvet</m>, one commonly puts <m>plain
canvas</m> or a <al>sheep</al> scabbard or a <m>parchment</m> cover. But
the best scabbard of all is a <m>waxed</m> scabbard, of either
<m>velvet</m> or <al>calf</al>. It is because one covers the <m>wood</m>
with <m>thin canvas</m>, which one next <m>waxes</m>, then one covers it
in <m>velvet</m> or <al>calf</al>. A <m>waxed</m> scabbard is worth at

that is white &amp; purified of any dirt &amp; dust &amp; black dross.
And when you wash it &amp; dry it to render it very white &amp; clean,
it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these

contains an <fr>œillet</fr> or sprout with the leaf, thus marked B.<comment rid="c_105r_01"/>
<del>But</del> <del><fr>plusto</fr></del> Then, carefully make on the

Next, separate, with the point of the <tl>penknife</tl>, the bark &amp;
open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your

it entirely with a <tl><m>slip of <pa>linen</pa></m></tl> or <tl><m>very
soft thread</m></tl>, so that there is nothing uncovered but the leaf,
which in three or 4 <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> will give you an indication
whether the shield should take, accordingly it will be green. Leave your
graft seven or eight <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> thus, then unbind it &amp;
join it well to the bark, especially at the sprout, &amp; then rebind
all gently but not as strongly as before; &amp; if there is any output

<head>A means of molding flowers and plants</head>

<ab>One needs to choose them in their full verdure &amp; vivacity, &amp;
<del>them <fr>mou</fr></del> not pick them, if possible, until the time
one will want to mold them, so that they do not wilt. Or, if you need to
carry them from afar, soak their stems in a <tl>bottle <add>of
<m>water</m></add></tl> or, better still, <m>wine</m>. Make, first, a
<m>wax</m> stick pointed like a large peg, of a size appropriate to what
you want to cast, as you see in the margin, marked A. Put &amp; prick at
the foot of this small peg a bit of rather thickish &amp;
strong <m>iron wire</m>. And at the point of this, you will fit your flower stem or your
plant. This done, set it aside neatly. And arrange your
<del><tl>mold</tl> of <fr>t</fr></del> circle &amp; shape of <m>clay</m>, as you
have done for the <al>snakes</al>, in the form of a <mu>mandore</mu>
<del>in such a way that</del> according to the size of your plant. Then,
take the one that you have prepared to be cast, as we have taught you,
&amp; wet &amp; moisten it very carefully with <m>good
<add>eau-de-vie</add></m> with a <tl>paintbrush</tl>. Then pass the
<tl><m>iron</m> stem</tl> through the end of the <m>earthen</m>
<mu>mandore</mu>, in order that the <m>wax</m> <del><fr>q</fr></del>
peg, where the plant is fastened, joins to the end of the <m>earthen</m>
<mu>mandore</mu>. And arrange thus your plant in such a way lying down
that it remains in the middle of the said <mu>mandore</mu>, without
touching on either side, so that <del>a</del><comment rid="c_033r_01"/> the <m>sand</m> that you will
pour in it will be of equal thickness <del>as</del> everywhere &amp;
<add>exceed</add> <corr><del>is</del></corr> everywhere by the height of two good
<ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> the top of the <del>such</del> plant. And
having secured the <tl><m>iron</m> stem</tl> well, promptly pour <del>wetted</del>
your <m>wetted sand</m>, much thinner than the one for <al>snakes</al>, in the
<mu>mandore</mu>. And the sooner the better, in order that the
<m>eau-de-vie</m> does not dry. And take heed to put in a little more
<m>sal ammoniac water among the
common</m><comment rid="c_117r_02"/> than you would do for the
<al>snakes</al>. And when you will make <m>sand</m> especially for your
bouquets, where you would mix in a little more <m>feather alum</m>, it
can only be better. Thus, your <tl>mold</tl> will be in one piece
and it will not be necessary to unjoin it, but rather <del>leave</del>
separate it from the <m>clay</m> once it will have set, let it dry, and
then reheat it again until the plants are burnt.
<del>Then</del> And note that if the plant you want to cast has
a strong stalk &amp; stem, you can cast it lying down, as had been said.
But if it is some weak &amp; delicate <add>flower</add>, <del>cast</del>
plant it upright with the <tl><m>wax</m> peg</tl> because the <m>sand</m> will
always <del>cast</del> lift it up, it being very thin. Do not forget to

<head>Casting in <tl>frames</tl></head>

<ab>The same <m>sand that was used in the cooked <fr>noyaulx</fr></m>,
composed, as is said, of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp; <m>feather alum</m>, is excellent for casting in <tl>frames</tl>, and I

ground finely upon <tl><m>marble</m></tl> what seemed to me too coarse.
And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with <df><m>sal ammoniac

<fr>ault</fr></del> two <del><fr>au t</fr></del> <tl><ms><m>silver</m>
spoonfuls</ms></tl> of <m>eau-de-vie</m>.
<del><fr>J’a</fr></del><comment rid="c_118v_03"/> Having thus moistened the <m>sand</m> in such a fashion
that it gives a good hold, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my

<m>oil</m> and all other <m>grease</m>, which are necessary to avoid,
for they would <del>make</del> hinder a good release. I blew on my medal
&amp; molded it, <add>and the female part of the <tl>frame</tl> once

<del>Once <fr>fai</fr></del> I separated the <tl>frame</tl> and did not hit the

that knocks the <m>sand</m> &amp; makes it <del><fr>esp</fr></del> crumble.
Rather, I struck the back of the <tl>frame</tl>, retaining the obverse of

<head>Advice about the above</head>

<ab><df><m>Good tin</m></df> is that which is hard as <m>silver</m>
&amp; soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
<m>tin</m> &amp; alloyed as is said.</ab>

<ab><m>Looking-glass tin</m> must not be <del><m>smoked</m></del> mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.</ab>

<ab> Nor must the forms be <m>smoked</m> until then.</ab>

<ab> If the <m>sand</m> shrinks in the <tl>frame</tl>, this means that it must
be reheated &amp; reddened on the fire.</ab>

<ab>Good <m>sand</m>, when moistened, does not stick at all to the
<tl><bp>hand</bp></tl> when pressed.</ab>

<ab>The <m>perfect sand for the <tl>frame</tl></m> is
<m><fr>aspalt</fr></m>, which is found in
<pl>Germany</pl>, which is soft as <m>flour</m> <del>&amp; <fr>presq</fr></del>
when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.</ab>

<ab>

<emph><la>Nota</la></emph><comment rid="c_119r_01"/> that the cast must be thin &amp; hardly thick
in order that it does not overtax the material, and must not
exceed the <ms>thickness of <del><fr>un</fr></del><comment rid="c_024r_05"/> the width of a <m>grain of
<pa>wheat</pa></m></ms>; likewise for <m>tin</m>, which wants to be cast
very thinly. For <m>lead</m>, a little thicker. There is no need to make
the vents very large &amp; deep either.</ab>

<ab>
For <tl>frames</tl>, the <m>sand that you use for the <fr>noyau</fr></m>, of the
aforesaid composition, is excellent. But in washing, crushing &amp;
reheating it several times, it must be corrupt from its nature &amp; no longer fit to make a hold &amp; to mold <fr>en noyau</fr>.</ab>

<ab>It is found in earth in <pl>Germany</pl>, the color of <m>cooked
plaster</m>, made of long filaments, very soft to handle. And because it
is mixed with <m>earth</m> and <m>filth</m>, one <tl>pestles</tl> it coarsely
&amp; one makes little balls, having for this purpose soaked it in
<m>sal ammoniac water</m> of such a composition that you were told
above. One places these balls to reheat in the fire of the <tl><fr>fornaise</fr>
of the <pro>potters</pro></tl>, then one soaks it again in the same
<m>water</m>. The <m>earth</m> and <add>the</add> coarseness and
<m>filth</m> go to the bottom, and the <m>pure <fr>aspalte</fr></m>,
which is light &amp; soft, and handleable as <m>wet flour</m>, adheres
with the <m>water</m> and goes to the surface, clouding the
<m>water</m>, which murkiness is emptied into a separate <tl>vase</tl>.
When it has settled, one empties the <m>water</m> by tilting or by taking
it away with a <tl>sponge</tl>, and the <m>pure <fr>aspalte</fr></m>
remains at the bottom. Dry it &amp; employ it in a <tl>frame</tl> that has
been moistened with <m>sal ammoniac water</m>. And try it in the
<tl>frame</tl>, in which it shrinks when reheated or dried, that is to
say that one needs to reheat it again on a good fire and redden it.
Thus, for medals and flat things, you should use this one, because it is
the most perfect of all for <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>copper</m>,
<m>lead</m>, <m>latten</m>, &amp; <m>tin</m>, for it withstands the fire
&amp; reddens whenever need be, without corrupting. The more it is used,
the <del><fr>b</fr></del> better it is, &amp; it does not spoil. At the beginning
it is white, &amp; being used, it becomes grey. However, make sure to put
aside the one that served for casting <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> &amp;
<m>latten</m>, for <m>gold</m> would sour in it, &amp; would not come
out of it well. And to do this better, you could put it aside to be used
for each <m>metal</m>. </ab>

<ab>

When you want to cast in <m>wax</m> in the <tl><m>plaster</m> mold</tl>,
you must know as secret that there is need for your <tl>mold</tl> to be
in <m>hot water</m>. Never does the animal come out so neatly as in

animal closest to nature <del>and</del> to repair
it afterward. One needs to smooth well away all the scales, <del>when</del> <add>for</add>
<m>wax</m> would enter there &amp; not release well. In molding thus
the animal, flatten down the scales for <m>wax</m> &amp;, on
the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they stand up for
animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not wait for the
<m>wax</m> to <del>a bit</del> cool completely to release it,
but do so when it is still a bit warm. When you have also molded the
first cast of the animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its
release, there is as much of it in one half of the <tl>mold</tl> as in the other. Make also strong wide gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified
when it is released, &amp; afterward you cut this off.</ab>

<head>Molding fruits and animals in <m>sugar</m></head>

<ab><m>Sugar</m> is fatty <add>when runny and brittle &amp; breakable
when dry</add>, and with it, one casts well round things &amp; large
muscles, but awkwardly things fine &amp; delicate. However, try
<m>well-clarified sugar</m>. One needs to soak for one <ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms>
or one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms> the <tl><m>plaster</m> mold</tl> before
casting the <m>sugar</m>, in order that it is very full of <m>water</m>
&amp; does not imbibe the <m>syrup</m>. One needs also for it to be of
easy release, for the <m>sugar</m> is sour &amp; brittle. Finally, do
not consider casting anything in <m>sugar</m> that does not release well
and that cannot be neatly molded in two halves, to open it when you will
need to. If you want to mold a bunch of <pa>grapes</pa>, one needs to
take it, like any other fruit, in its true vigor, for if it is withered,
it will <del>not</del> come out that way. Take heed, therefore,
to make your <tl>molds</tl> in the natural <tmp>season</tmp> of
<del>that</del> all things. The <pa>grapes</pa> that are
usually wanted cast in <m>sugar</m> can be made artificially or with
<m>wax</m> or <m>earth</m>, or even with some <pa>grapes</pa> attached
with some <m>melted wax</m> on some <tl>slab</tl> &amp; other full
thing, so that they are very close together and release well, &amp; only
make up one half. Or, if you have some of those <pa>grapes</pa> called
<pa><fr>chauchés</fr></pa> or <pa><fr>sauvignons</fr></pa>, which have the <pa>grapes</pa>
very close together, encase half of them <del>on</del> in the
<tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl> and cast on the other half. And if some 
<pa>grape</pa> is not released, pluck it out. Note that neither in
<m>sugar</m>, nor in <m>metal</m>, can a <pa>bunch</pa> which has light &amp;
separated <pa>grapes</pa> be cast properly, because the end of the bunch
is so delicate, especially if the <pa>grapes</pa> are kept, that it could not
sustain the large <pa>grapes</pa>. Thus, you will need to cast
hollow, which you could not do if the <pa>bunch</pa> does not have the
<pa>grapes</pa> close together &amp; <del><tl>molds</tl></del> without having them
scattered &amp; spread apart.</ab>

You will see that it will torment it &amp; heat it very well and soon
render it very liquid &amp; ready to cast and be clarified, as it should
be. When it is in this state &amp; when it is very white and polished,
shining like <m>quicksilver</m>, prepare yourself to cast. And to this
effect, have some <m>lean delicate sand</m>, in a
<tl><fr>terrine</fr></tl> or another <tl>vessel</tl>, that you would
like to help yourself to. Make a pit in your <m>sand</m>, then, with your
<tl>pincers</tl>, take your <tl>well-reddened mold</tl> &amp; place it
in this pit of <m>sand</m>. Cover immediately the opening of your <tl>mold
</tl>in order that no <m>ash</m> &amp; dust enters inside, &amp; then
enclose it with <m>sand</m> up to the edge of the gate &amp; the vents. This done,
uncover your <tl>mold </tl>&amp; throw on top of your <m>well-melted
silver</m>, the <ms>size of a <pa>pea</pa></ms> or thereabouts, some
of this metallic grain, which will immediately spread through
all your <m>silver</m> &amp; make it boil &amp; turn. Cast as soon as
you have put in this substance, for it is this that is the secret to
making the <m>silver </m>run, since its crust heats it &amp; clarifies
it. You can cast <m>silver finer than the alloy from the <pl>capital
</pl>and like that of the <cn>real</cn></m>, but you must add this
grain in.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



With all of this, do not let yourself forget to put, before all things,
a little <m>borax </m>in the <m>melted silver</m>, for even though
<pro>goldsmiths</pro> do not put any in, nevertheless it is good, and I have
seen it practiced well. Next, one puts in the crust of the substance at

<head>Whitening of cast <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>

Because one commonly casts in <m>base silver</m>, &amp; especially the
<pl>Germans</pl>, and that such an alloy readily makes a film
or crust, <del>which is contrary to</del> <del>our</del> <add>some</add>
<pro>goldsmiths</pro> <del>from <pl>France</pl></del> are usually quick
to whiten their works, especially rough ones, because they only
use <m>common <fr>bullitoyre</fr></m>, which is <m>tartar</m> &amp;
<m>common salt</m>, <ms>nearly as much of one as the other</ms>. But I
have seen an excellent <pl>German</pl> working thus. Having in my
presence cast a <al>little lizard</al> with an <m>alloy of
<cn>teston</cn></m>, he made a greyish <del><fr>noi</fr></del> crust.
And to clean it from it, he boiled it in the above-mentioned
<m><fr>bullitoyre</fr></m> of <m>tartar</m> &amp; <add>pulverized</add>
<m>common salt</m> <del>and</del> mixed with <m>common water</m>, in the
fire of his <tl>forge</tl>. Once taken out, he <tl>brushed</tl> it. And
because it was not as clean of this crust as he fancied, he burned some
<m>tartar</m> <add>in some <tl><m>paper</m></tl></add> until it was
black &amp; no longer <m>smoked</m>. Then, he wetted the aforesaid <m>tartar</m>
<del><fr>d</fr></del> with the <m>water of <fr>bullitoyre</fr></m>,
composed of <m>salt</m> &amp; <m>tartar</m>, &amp; covered all his
<al>lizard</al> with it. Then, he put it between the live <del>of</del>
<m>charcoals</m> of his <tl>forge</tl> &amp; blew a little. When the
<al>lizard</al> was red, he took it out, let it cool, then reheated it
in the <m><fr>bullitoyre</fr></m>. Next, he <tl>brushed</tl> it in
<m>clear water</m>. </ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

<mark>+</mark><lb/>

Note that the <m><fr>bullitoyre</fr></m> for <m>silver</m> is never good
in a <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> because the <m>water</m>, taking the form of the
<del><fr>f</fr></del> <m>tartar</m>, evaporates. But the <tl>vessel</tl>
for boiling, being of <m>copper</m>, is excellent for the whitening of
<m>silver</m> &amp; for the mixture which colors <m>gold</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



He took heed not to let his <m>water of tartar</m> boil so much that it
would have poured out on top, because then its strength goes away. Therefore, when this first fury of boiling comes, remove it from the fire &amp; put it
back. He held as a secret this <m>burned tartar</m> put on top for

<head>When the cast of <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> becomes porous</head>

<ab>

If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
<m>wax</m> which you can gild afterward with <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. To prevent this, if you cast thin, the alloy of one
<ms>℥</ms> <del><fr>d’est</fr></del> of <m>lead</m> for
one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>tin</m> is good. But if you cast with <m>lead</m>
<add>for a thick thing</add>, one needs for one <ms>lb</ms> of the
latter, two <ms>℥</ms> of <m>tin</m>, for the
<m>lead</m>, being fatty &amp; weighty, carries more. From this alloy, I
cast a <al>large lizard</al> like a natural one. In thick things,
<del>if</del> which keep their heat a <tmp>long time</tmp>, if there is little
<m>tin</m>, it makes it porous. Your <tl>mold</tl> must not be cold, but
<sn>of such a heat that you can handle it without harm, or that you can
keep your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> in the gate without burning yourself</sn>.
It is also necessary that your <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> be as if red.
Melt first the <m>lead</m> &amp; then the alloy of <m>tin</m> on top.
And as you want to cast, put a piece of <m>rosin</m> &amp; then a
little<m> looking-glass tin</m>. If you put too
much <m>lead</m> into the <m>tin</m>, it does not run very thin. And to know
<add>this</add>, if <del><fr>l</fr></del><comment rid="c_123v_01"/> the <m>tin</m> <sn>cries loudly</sn>,
it is a sign there is not too much <m>lead</m>. If it <sn>cries weakly</sn>, that

<ab>The <m>latten from skillets in which one makes the mush for

the one that is in the remelted <del><fr>de</fr></del> <m>latten</m> is
half corrupted from its nature, &amp; makes it become porous &amp;
blusters because it is disposed to exhaling. Therefore, use
<m>calamine</m> alone, on its own, very recent, on the melted
<m>latten</m>. Take heed to cast very hot &amp; that your <tl>mold</tl>
be red like for <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>copper</m> &amp;
<m><fr>metal</fr></m>.<comment rid="c_016v_05"/> If you cast with recent <m>calamine</m>, <md>keep

<m><pl>German</pl> tokens</m> to cast medals &amp; took thirty &amp; xii
<m>nails of rosette</m>, like for chairs, which are of
<m>soft latten</m>. This substance, containing a lot of
<m>calamine</m>, like all <m>strong yellow latten</m>, has made great fumes,
which is what prevents <m>latten</m> from running<add> and makes it
porous</add>. Make many vents &amp; cast very hot, that your
<m>latten</m> is white like <m>water</m> or <m>melted silver</m> &amp;
similar to a very polished <m>steel</m> mirror. The second fusion comes

fumes as much. If it is in a <tl>frame</tl> which does not break

Your <m>sand</m> having set, clean &amp; scrape your <tl>mold</tl> on one side
&amp; the other, &amp; make a notch at the foot &amp; the border of the

in order that the second cast joins with it without varying, &amp;
especially make a notch at the bottom of the <tl>mold</tl>

<head>Cast of <m>wax</m> to represent an animal that one has not

<ab>Take some <m>white wax</m>, which is more appropriate for this work

The <m>charcoal</m> gives color <add>and body</add> to the <m>wax</m>,
which would otherwise be transparent &amp; the features would not be
seen as well. Therefore, put your <m>wax</m> to melt in the charcoal fire. And when it will be well melted &amp; liquid, take, for a

<m>sulfur</m> <del><fr>la</fr></del> <ms>as a large

<ab> like other things, &amp; on this occasion, you can cast two or

the first cast, your work becomes porous and does not come out neat
<del><ill/></del>, it is all the same, for it is necessary that you
realise that the three or four first ones are not readily good. In the
first one, you recognize if there are some barbs, which keep from
releasing well and you remove them if they do not remove
<add>themselves</add> at the second or third first casts. And the more
you will cast, the neater you will make it, and your <tl>mold</tl> will serve
you for more than a hundred times if it is well managed. But it is
good to soak it one <ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms> or one

imbibed. The same must be done for fruits of <m>sugar</m>. <sn>This
<m>wax</m> is very soft &amp; amiable &amp; pliant as

provides an example for casting many other very difficult things. Males
are distinguished by the eggs that females carry and by the four
<del>legs</del> little white leglets at the back that males
<del><fr>ap</fr></del> have inside their tail, after the
eight main legs. It is only a good thing to dry them out a little,
because the lumps only come out <del>hard</del> rougher &amp; more
beautiful, for everything that is of shell does not diminish. It is true
that if you let them dry too much, these little inside leglets diminish
&amp; become more slender &amp; do not have as much body. If also they
are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales. Take heed, therefore,
to use moderation. They have some hair between the legs &amp; at the end
of the tail. And because all hair is vexing to mold, because it
gets mixed up with the <m>sand</m> &amp; is not released, you can burn it with
a <tl>hot <m>iron</m></tl> on the <al>crayfish</al>, so that no one sees
it. As for animals that have hair or feathers, it is necessary that you
anoint them with <m><add><pa>olive</pa></add> <pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, which
is quickly dry &amp; which will keep the hair flat &amp; spread out.
Thus, you will have the form of your animal and the hair will also show,
but made wavy, and this is something which can be repaired. If your
<al>crayfish</al> has eggs, which are delicate and which
would be awkward to uncover without breaking, you would do better to
make the first cast on the belly &amp; eggs, in order that
<del>you</del> you only need to uncover the back, which is hard &amp;
easy to handle. And the belly &amp; the eggs will remain in the

<del>all</del> it will open easily, for what is burned will no longer be

recognize that they are dry enough when, after having brought the inside
&amp; the imprint of these to the fire, <sn>they cry &amp; crackle once

<head>Repairing cast things</head>

<ab>

It happens often that what you have cast makes flashing, either through
fault in the <tl>mold</tl>, or from the cast, or from the <m>metal</m>.
The fault in the <tl>mold</tl> comes from <m>plaster</m>, which is not
hard &amp; strong and does not withstand fire (which is corrected by
mixing it with <m><la>crocum</la></m>). Usually as well, if there is an
imperfection, it is from the cast. If there is also too much <m>tin</m>
in a moderately thick thing, it does not come out well, because
<m>tin</m> cast thick retracts &amp; becomes porous. Also, things
molded hollow are fanciful to cast. If, therefore, some flaw should
happen, take a <tl><m>leather</m> cushionet</tl> full of <m>fine sand</m>,
&amp; having placed it on the <fr>bequet</fr><comment rid="c_152v_02"/> of the
<tl><pro>goldsmith’s</pro> table</tl>, where one <tl>files</tl>, place
your work on it &amp; secure it with a <tl>rope</tl> <add>which passes
under your <tl><bp>foot</bp></tl></add>. The <m>sand</m> in the <tl>bag</tl>
obeys &amp; arranges itself by and by, thick on one side &amp; thin on
the other. Then, forthwith, with a <tl>burin</tl>, make &amp; trace
roughly the fine lines which were omitted or which are not apparent
enough, or with a <tl>file</tl> or a <tl><fr>chaple</fr></tl>, remove
the flashing. And if there is some fault in the substance, which left some
pit or too-hollow thing, rescrape this with a <tl>burin</tl> and
notch around the edge, then imprint this with some <m>wax</m>. And place
the imprint on a <tl><m>delicate plate of lead</m></tl>, &amp; mark
thus the appropriate measure of <m>lead</m> or of the alloy similar to
your substance, then place the piece of the notched thing &amp; attach
it well with some <tl><m>latten wire</m></tl>, then rub the edge with
<m>rosin</m> if it is <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> &amp; place all around
some small thin pieces of <m>solder</m> or <m>tin</m> or other things,
then with a <tl>hot <m>iron</m></tl> or in the fire of the
<tl>forge</tl>, <m>solder</m>, and next repair this with the aforesaid

The principal thing is to let your reheated <tl>molds</tl> cool down
well rather than cleaning them &amp; blowing inside them to make the
<m>wax</m> come out, because when the <tl>mold</tl> is hot, the <m>ash</m>

And when you have cast your <m>tempered sand</m>, blow
thoroughly until it begins to set. The <pa>rose</pa> came out
well. But because the <m>sand</m> finds itself mixed among the petals, make your

<head>Molding a <al>fly</al></head>

<ab>Take the <al>largest <del><fr>vo</fr></del> flies</al> that go into

to dry a lot, their <del><fr>e</fr></del> legs would break when you
want to spread them out. One needs also, to make them come out
better, to place them on something like a leaf, or similar thing, to
help the casting of their little legs, which are so frangible that, by
themselves, they would not come out well in the cast. They can be
planted on a <pa>sage</pa> leaf or similar. They are cast well in
<m>silver</m> &amp; <m>gold</m>, but one usually makes the legs &amp;

joined there &amp; make the leaves frangible. The
<m>☿</m> cleans the <m>ash</m> well, especially flat

weight. And thus, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, do not
use it. But if it is necessary to use it, mix your <m>sand</m> with

<head>Reducing a round figure to a hollow form</head>

<ab>You need to first mold it with some <m>plaster</m>, as said
before, &amp; in the <m>plaster</m> cast in <m>wax</m>, from which will
come out a relief that you will repair very neatly, and
<del><fr>b</fr></del><comment rid="c_169v_01"/> model it as you fancy. And then you will model
this relief of <m>wax</m> again in <m>plaster</m>, or better yet, with
your <m>wetted sand <mark>#</mark><comment rid="c_112r_02"/> like for <fr>noyau</fr></m>, &amp; in the
latter, cast in some <m>lead</m>, &amp; from this you will have a very
neat relief, &amp; if it is not, repair <add>on the <m>cement</m> or
otherwise</add>, &amp; take heed that it is always of good release. And
this one will always serve you well for making as many hollow forms as you
please, in this way. Place <add>half of</add> your figure of
<m>lead</m>, <m>oiled</m> &amp; wetted with <m>eau-de-vie</m> according
to the above, in the <tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl>, then mold this half with
some <m>white plaster</m>. Having set <del>Next</del> <add>and having
well smoothed &amp; flattened the <m>plaster</m></add>, take your
<m>black wax mixed with sulfur</m>, as is said, because it leaves
nothing in the <tl>mold</tl> &amp; melts quicker. Wet it in <m><bp>warm
urine</bp></m>, &amp; once softened enough, make an imprint with it
on the half of the <m>lead</m> figure, and <del>it</del> you will have a
very neat hollow form. Shape next the hollow <m>wax</m> form in a square shape, as
you please, with sufficient thickness &amp; smooth it well on all sides,
&amp; <del>thus</del> next, mold this hollowed <m>wax</m>,
imprinted on one part &amp; flat &amp; smooth on the other, in the same
fashion that you mold flat medals of <m>wax</m> or <del>other</del>
<m>metal</m> <fr>en noyau</fr>. And the <tl>mold</tl> <fr>en noyau</fr>
will render in <m>silver</m> or such <m>metal</m> as pleases you
<del>the <fr>m</fr></del> a similar figure to the <m>wax</m>, that is to
say flat &amp; smooth on one side &amp; hollow on the other. And having

you will be able to mix there some works of <m>sugar</m>,</ab>

<head>Cleaning closed <tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
