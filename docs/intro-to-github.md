During the development process, we will be using [[Github]{.underline}](https://github.com/), a hosting platform for software development that utilizes
[[Git]{.underline}](https://git-scm.com/), the open source system for distributed version control and source code management.

        i.  Github allows large-scale and international collaboration on
            > thousands of projects. While Git was originally intended
            > for software development, it can be used in any
            > collaborative working setup where maintenance of
            > versioning is desirable.

        ii. Some of you may already be familiar with Github, and for
            > those of you who are not, fear not! Apart from Terry and
            > Nick, no one on the M&K team had any experience with
            > Github, but picked it up fairly quickly. We will review
            > Github together during our next check-ins and make sure
            > everyone has the resources they need to work efficiently.

        iii. At each small check-in, we will create and set up a
             > repository for each case-study project and introduce you
             > to some of the built-in project management features we
             > will use together

    -   **Next steps:** small group "one-on-one" meetings in late
        > January / early February

        -   We have created a number of 1.5 hour slots where we would
            > like to meet with two projects at once. Choose the slot
            > you would like, based on your availability and/or the
            > other project you wouldn't mind sharing the time with. As
            > you will see, there are two sign-ups for each slot and you
            > will be able to see who else has signed up for that slot:
            > [[https://www.slottr.com/sheets/18274157]{.underline}](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.slottr.com_sheets_18274157&d=DwMFaQ&c=009klHSCxuh5AI1vNQzSO0KGjl4nbi2Q0M1QLJX9BeE&r=kiXbfzspwEVSXFrNIWEJcXxQdILZ3Af5CpX9CuxXYfg&m=4Pwu-QGwwk8aLx20tQt7Zq4G4IWrrn7mym2GUjWyDlCW0ccu6p82tW-oRDQAZ1XS&s=G907Y9B-RzlE1By8OolJ4QbC7KKvA3-4VAXicKY-80M&e=).

            -   If no slots work for you, please don't hesitate to reach
                > out.

        -   Please also create a Github account (it is free) if you
            > don't have one already and send me your username. See
            > [[Getting started with your GitHub
            > account]{.underline}](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)
            > for more details

        -   Some more advanced preparation if you can:

            -   Take a look at [[M&K's repository for Ms. Fr. 640's
                > data]{.underline}](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data) -
                > read through the "read me" (scroll down below the file
                > and directory listings) to get familiar with how we
                > have already worked within Github for our Edition

            -   Skim over [[Basic writing and formatting syntax in
                > Markdown]{.underline}](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
                > Markdown is the language used throughout Github and,
                > as its name suggests, is a simplified markup language
                > that allows you to style and format text and media,
                > which converts readily to html, but is much easier to
                > pick up and write with. Almost all of the webpages of
                > M&K's Edition are authored in markdown (which you can
                > see in our [[Edition Webpages
                > repository]{.underline}](https://github.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages)).

Looking forward to meeting with you all soon,

Naomi, Pamela, Caroline, Terry, and Nick
