## <span class="m">Amber</span>

 
It softens like a paste when it is boiled in molten <span class="m">wax</span>, and colors when boiled with the <span class="m">grease</span> of a young <span class="al">kid</span>, since that <span class="sup">the grease</span> of a <span class="al">goat</span> would break it, especially if it is glazed.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Bois madre</span>

 
The <span class="m"><span class="pa">elm</span></span>, in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks diversified with grey and black, and the <span class="m">root of the <span class="pa">maple</span></span>, but one needs to chose well the grain of the <span class="m">wood</span>. One gives the <span class="m"><span class="pa">maple</span></span> a certain yellow color, then one varnishes it.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sugared</span> and <span class="m">mulled wine</span>

 
 When the <span class="pl">English</span> have a cold, they mull <span class="m">wine</span> in this way. They heat <span class="m">wine</span> in a <span class="del">large</span> <span class="m">tin</span> pot until it boils, and when it becomes frothy, <span class="del"></span>they light it with burning <span class="m">paper</span> to determine if it is hot enough. After, to mull the whole of it, they pour it from one vessel into another, as if they wanted to churn <span class="m">eau panée</span>, and as they do it, someone else lights with a burning <span class="m">paper</span> what is falling from the one vessel into the other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the <span class="m">wine</span> is mulled enough, heat it again a little while adding a few <span class="m">cloves</span> & a sufficient quantity of <span class="m">sugar</span>. And they <span class="sup">the <span class="pl">English</span></span> <span class="del"></span> drink it when it is as hot as possible in order to overcome their melancholy.

>   <span class="pl">English</span> commoners put <span class="m">sugar</span> in <span class="m">wine</span> as a substitute for new sweet <span class="m">wine</span>, which they cannot have because, owing to the long sea crossing, the <span class="m">wine</span> loses its sweetness and clarifies itself before it reaches their country.
 
 
  

## Weary <span class="al">horses</span>

 
In order to restore a harried <span class="al">horse</span>, they make it drink some of the aforesaid <span class="m">wine</span> through a horn, and it finds itself disposed to do an even harder labor.

 
  

## <span class="m">Eau de vie</span>

 
The <span class="al">Irish</span> do not drink any <span class="m">wine</span> because they convert it into <span class="m">spirits</span>, which they use almost as habitually as we use <span class="m">wine</span>.
