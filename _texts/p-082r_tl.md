## <span class="m">Copper</span> heat

 
It is hot enough when you see it <span class="sup">is</span>clean & smooth on top of its impurity.
 
 
  

## Box mold

 
<span class="m">Iron</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> swell if the <span class="m">metal</span> touches it [the box mold], & the <span class="m">wood</span> warps. Thus, make a mold from <span class="m">wood</span>, & [then] make the box molds from <span class="m">brick</span>s in this mold <span class="sup">the <span class="m">wood</span>en mold</span> of the thickness that you will want.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Egg white</span>

 
<span class="m">Egg white</span> gives strength to <span class="m">sand</span> so that many casts <span class="sup">can be</span> made from it
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Watchmakers</span>

 
To distribute the teeth proportionately on their wheels, they do not use a compass because there is no compass so fine that it can draw distances as small as those of the small wheels. But they make a platform (as they call it) out of <span class="m">latten</span> <span class="sup">that has been</span> divided into various circles, & each <span class="sup">of those</span> circle<span class="sup">s</span> is divided into equal sections marked by a point. And each circle has a certain number <span class="sup">of points</span>, as <span class="sup">for example</span> one <span class="sup">has</span> 30, another 36, others 40 &. Then, on the pierced center of the platform, they place the little wheel. And on the center of the wheel <span class="sup">there is</span> a flat line or an alidade which points to the number on the circle that you want to mark on your wheel. Then with a point, they draw a line on the wheel. Then they return the alidade to the following point, & they thus go on marking it <span class="sup">the dial</span>. And to mark the points on the circles of their platform, they divide the circle in three & then divide this third part into as many sections as is necessary with regard to the total division of the circle. &, in this manner, they make the teeth's division & distribution as fine as they please.
