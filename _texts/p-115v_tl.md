## <span class="m">Tin</span> casting

 
If the <span class="m">herbage</span> or <span class="m">flower</span> you want to cast is delicate and fine, <span class="m">tin</span> must exceed <span class="m">lead</span> in your mixture; on the contrary, if it the flower or herbage is thick, you must add into your mixture more <span class="m">lead</span> than <span class="m">tin</span>. For a fine thing<span class="m">,</span> add one part of <span class="m">tin</span> for four parts of <span class="m">lead</span>. Your mold must not be too hot, so you can hold it with your hand when you cast. Your alloyed <span class="m">tin</span> must be very hot and almost red for casting, and that way it will enter all the small parts of the mold. Otherwise, your tin will cool down before reaching the thin parts of your <span class="m">herbage</span>. Do not forget to mix a little <span class="m">bismuth</span> in your mixture; that way, your tin will run better and be firmer.

But do not put too much, because if hardens the matter and makes it sour, and if your work on fine things —— like legs and similar things —— it will not cast properly.
 
 
  

## Giving ventilation to your mold

 
If your herbage is very fine, in addition to vents, you can drive a thread through the <span class="m">clay</span> contour of your herbage instead of casting with a needle, and thread it also in the herbage. The thread will burn, like the herbage, and the hole will remain, thus giving extra ventilation.

>   Do not remove your annealed molds out of the <span class="m">fire</span> before they have cooled down by themselves. Also make sure that your very hot molds do not come into contact with wind or coldness otherwise they would burst. Do not reheat your molds before they are drained and firm again, otherwise they would cast before the vent holes are made and the clamps are fixed.
 
 
  

## Annealing core molds

 
After your molds have their cast vents and clamps, fix the clamps as above mentioned. Then make a round, made of <span class="m">bricks</span>, at the edge of your forge, or in a clean place. Fill this round with big, half—lighted pieces of <span class="m">charcoal</span>. Put your molds on the round, and leave it during half an hour, that way it will gently heat up and not all at once. Finally, when <span class="m">coals</span> start being white, add big half—lighted big pieces of <span class="m">charcoal</span> and blow with your small bellows until hot. Do as such, slowly, until the molds redden inside and out. If you want to cast a herbage or an animal which are difficult to strip, and you need to burn what is in the mold, look into the cast and see if it is molds are quite red and inflamed inside; this will be a sign that they are properly annealed. If it is not so, increase the heat and keep at it until it becomes thus. If there is nothing inside the mold to be burnt, this heat is good for <span class="m">tin</span> casting. The molds for <span class="m">tin</span> casting are much better annealed in a reverberatory furnace.

 Do not heat too much at first otherwise your molds could break
