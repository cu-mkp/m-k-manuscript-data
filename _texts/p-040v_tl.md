## Cross of the commanders of <span class="pl">Malta</span>

 
This beautiful <span class="m">rouge clair</span> which makes the field of the white <span class="m">enamel</span> cross is <span class="del">blood</span> of fine tear of <span class="m">dragon's blood</span> tempered with <span class="m">eau de vie</span> or else <span class="m"><span class="pl">Indian</span> laque plate</span>, which in my opinion is made in <span class="pl">Flanders</span>, tempered with clear <span class="m">turpentine</span> & tear of <span class="m">mastic</span> amp; laid down on a <span class="m">silver</span> leaf, not the kind which the <span class="pro">painters</span> use, but a thicker kind, which is burnished by <span class="pro">those who make foil backings for gemstones</span> <span class="del">Av</span> or by <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span>, amp; that gives it this beautiful brilliance.

 
  

## <span class="m">Latten</span> and <span class="m">calamine</span>

 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> do not melt <span class="m">latten</span> in a <span class="tl"><span class="del">air</span><span class="add">bellow</span> furnace</span> but in <span class="tl">crucibles</span>, for in a <span class="tl"><span class="add">bellow</span> furnace</span> & amid the <span class="m">charcoals</span>, the <span class="m">calamine</span> would disappear. <span class="del">A</span>

 
  

## <span class="m">Metal</span>

 
<span class="m">Tin</span> should be pure for if there is any <span class="m">lead</span>, it will go up in smoke while melting. Mixed <span class="m">tin</span> holds in the fire for a long time but the <span class="tl"><span class="m">cendrée</span></span> separates it.

 
  

## <span class="m">Aqua fortis</span>

 
If your retort is well luted you should not surround it with <span class="m">ashes</span>, which would only prevent the vapors from escaping properly. But when, towards the end, you fire it intensely, surround it with <span class="m">charcoals</span> lit elsewhere beforehand, such as those in the furnace should be, so they do not crackle or smoke. Place said lit <span class="m">charcoals</span> around the body of the retort, not close to the neck, which does not need to be heated as much. The top grate, on which you place your retort, should be sufficiently far, one <span class="ms">dour</span> or half a foot, from the bottom grate where the <span class="m">charcoal</span> is placed, since thus you will not waste as much <span class="sup">aqua fortis</span>.
