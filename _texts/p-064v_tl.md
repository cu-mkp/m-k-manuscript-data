## Apprenticeship of the <span class="pro">painter</span>

 
First, one gives him an <span class="m">egg</span> to do in which one has him make half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two & three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the <span class="m">charcoal</span> by the end, & also the <span class="tl">pinceau</span>. Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to layer colors.
 
 
  

## One also presents him with these strokes & lines

 
<span class="del">C</span> <span class="add">T</span>he figure of the <span class="m">egg</span> is the main pattern for faces <span class="add">and for bent bodies</span>, as the cross is the model for a straight & whole figure. Without these strokes you will never do well.

## Softening

 
To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but rather layer them twice, except for <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span>.

>   All colors that have no body in <span class="m">oil</span> have none in <span class="m">distemper</span>, <span class="del">and</span> but in <span class="m">distemper</span> they sink to the bottom. <span class="m">Distemper</span> colors want to be greasy, which is recognised when they gel on the <span class="tl">palette</span> once distempered in <span class="m">oil</span>.
 
 
  

## Straight lines

 
You can use the <span class="tl">ruler</span>, but do not lay it flat on the panel, but as if lifted off, & resting on the edges of the panel. Otherwise you would smudge everything, & also you would not see the stroke well.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Distemper</span>

 
<span class="m">Distemper</span> colors need to be <span class="add">kept</span> darker <span class="del">pr</span> while you temper them, <span class="add">because they whiten while drying</span>. But <span class="m">oil</span> colors remain the same in color.
