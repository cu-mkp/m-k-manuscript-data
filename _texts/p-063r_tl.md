## <span class="pa">Amaranth</span> color

 
Although it is said to be immortal, it is nonetheless the case that <span class="m">white wine</span> removes its tint & turns claret—colored, & next the dried <span class="m">flower</span> ends up white. Note that thus <span class="m">wine</span>, & I have tried it. <span class="m">Eau de vie</span> does as much.
 
 
  

## Drying of <span class="m">oil</span>

 
If the <span class="m">oil</span> does not dry out, put in <span class="m">massicot</span> & <span class="m">minium</span>. There is no better <span class="m">oil than <span class="pa">walnut</span></span>, for it does not dry out too soon nor too late.
 
 
  

## Casting

 
The <span class="pl">Germans</span> use <span class="m">lead from <span class="pl">Flanders</span></span> because it is very soft. And to cast better they take <span class="m">lead ore</span> & melt it, & separate what is melted from the from the <span class="m">filth</span> & <span class="m">ore</span>, & pour it into a separate <span class="tl">vessel</span>, then <span class="del">the bottom</span> they cast with it. For the <span class="m">lead</span> must not have been used in works before, but rather completely new. Some cast into <span class="tl">molds of <span class="m">iron</span> & <span class="m">copper</span></span>.

>   or new <span class="m">lead</span> coming from the <span class="env">mine</span>. They melt it twice in a <span class="tl">crucible</span>. In the first one, they cleanse it of <span class="m">filth</span>. In the second, they <span class="del">en</span> cast.
 
 
  

## Shadows

 
<span class="pl">German</span> <span class="pro">painters</span> make their shadows on flesh colour of people with ground <span class="m">jet</span>, <span class="m">stil de grain yellow</span> & <span class="m">ochre</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Bistre</span>

 
It is only used in <span class="m">distemper</span>, & with this wood color is made.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Verdigris</span> and another very beautiful bright green

 
One ought not to grind it with <span class="m">water</span> alone, for that makes it die. To render it beautiful in <span class="m">distemper</span>, some grind it with <span class="m">vinegar</span>, but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To render it beautiful, grind it with <span class="m">urine</span> & leave to dry. Then, whenever you like, grind it with <span class="m">oil</span>. And after you have collected it with the <span class="tl">spatula</span>, before finishing to clean the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, grind <span class="m">stil de grain yellow</span> on it. And you will have a very beautiful green.
