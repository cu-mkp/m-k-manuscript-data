*[continued]*
  
for fifteen days. Next you will break it sc. the bottle from a good distance & with a long stick without looking at it & your eyes covered, you will put it where you want, or rub a little in a running river or on a tree or on grass that is on the bank.

 
  

## Another for <span class="m">waters</span>

 
<span class="al">Toad</span> in a pot, with quicklime, who will consume all this powder, next and.

 
  

## <span class="m">Damascus steel</span>

 
Distil some worms on one side & some horseradish leaf on the other & mix these two <span class="m">waters</span>, as much one as the other, and do the tempering in that.

 
  

## To know one's course in open sea

 
Soak a piece of <span class="m">cloth</span> in <span class="m">oil</span>, then attach it to the poop of the boat so that it is dipped in the water, and it will make a trail that will be visible for ten leagues since the <span class="m">water</span> parts wherever the <span class="m">oil</span> has passed.

 
  

## For casting

 
<span class="m">Chalk</span> most recently taken from the <span class="env">quarry</span> is good for <span class="m">lead</span>. One ought not grind wet, but rather grind finely while pestling or scraping through a <span class="tl">sieve</span>. Thus for <span class="m">pumice</span>, which one ought not grind with <span class="m">water</span>, nor corrupt its natural state. <span class="m">Lead</span> should be slightly mixed with <span class="m">tin</span>, in order only to give it strength, and two <span class="ms">parts</span> <span class="del">of<span class="m">tin</span>for</span> of <span class="m">lead</span> for <span class="del">of</span> one of <span class="m">tin</span> or more.
