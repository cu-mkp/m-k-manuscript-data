## <span class="m"><span class="pro">Printers</span>’ letters</span>

 
Those who make them, mix into the <span class="m">lead</span> some <span class="del"><span class="m">nails</span></span> <span class="m">nailheads</span> & old <span class="m">horseshoes</span>, & <span class="m">antimony</span> which makes it all melt. This composition is strong for printing, &holds steadfast. It runs and is good for casting in <span class="m">lead</span>.
 
 
  

## Casting in <span class="m">copper</span> 

 
It is necessary that the <span class="tl">box mold</span> be well smooth & that it fits well also on the <span class="tl">board</span> where it sits, so that it holds firm & does not shift when one moulds. It is necessary that the sand be clean & well chosen and well reheated, & pulverised very finely on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, for the one that you want to put first on the medal, and when molding you press strongly. Guard against <span class="m">oiling</span> your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly and reheat well, & let cool. Moisten your sand with <span class="m">wine boiled with <span class="pa">elm</span> root</span>, and cast <span class="m">latten</span> which comes out well, namely from the <span class="m">substance of the trebuschets</span> and similar thin things. Make your cast broad & even if it is barely thick, it will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the <span class="tl">mold</span>. Cast from the foot of the medal, so that the face, further away from the heat, comes out better & sweetened from the violent heat. And if your <span class="tl">box mold</span> does not have vents, make some <span class="del">qu</span> in the sand, which come, from the corners of the piece, to render themselves into the cast. Cast very hot, something that you will know, when you cast a little leftover substance in the one which has already been melted, & if it melts quickly, this is a sign it is <span class="del">fo</span> well hot. At that time, invigorate the heat of your <span class="tl">furnace</span> with <span class="tl">bellows</span> of the right size, keeping the mouth of the <span class="tl">furnace</span> well covered with some big <span class="del"><span class="m">copper</span></span> <span class="tl"><span class="m">tile</span></span> or other similar thing, which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take your well red <span class="tl">mollettes</span> & the <span class="tl">crooked <span class="m">iron</span></span> as well, to clean the <span class="m">charcoals</span> which are in your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">latten</span> wirebrush</span>. The <span class="m">grindings from sharpening large scissors & large knives</span> is very good for <span class="m">copper</span>.
