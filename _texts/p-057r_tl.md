*[continued]*
  
 <span class="m">Lake</span> takes long to dry in <span class="m">oil</span> and for that reason one must grind <span class="m">glass</span> in it. But one needs to choose <span class="m">crystallin</span> because it is neater. And because it would be too difficult to grind by itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it into cold <span class="m">water</span>, & it will be crumbled & pulverized easily for grinding after. Being well ground <span class="del">it</span> with a lot of <span class="m">water</span>, it resembles ground <span class="m">lead white</span>, but for this it has no body. I think it would be good for casting.
 
 <span class="m">Lead white</span> is made with <span class="m">sheet lead</span> beaten subtle & put under the <span class="m">dung</span>.
 
 <span class="m">White varnish of <span class="m">turpentine</span> or of <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> and <span class="m">turpentine</span></span> is colored with <span class="m">pulverized terra emerita</span>, making it boil together. It gives agold color on <span class="m">silver</span> and more beautiful if it is burnished. It is dry in <span class="tmp">a quarter of an hour</span>. <span class="m">Aloe</span> would make brighter color, but it takes long to dry & the other is dry in <span class="tmp">a quarter of an hour</span>, <span class="tmp">in winter</span> as well as <span class="tmp">summer</span>.
 
 Good <span class="m">lake</span> moistened with <span class="m">saliva</span> is rendered promptly dark. That from <span class="pl">Florence</span> is too gummed.
 
 If you make a layer of <span class="m"><span class="pro">printers</span>' ink</span> on <span class="m">velvet</span> and there apply <span class="m">gold leaf</span> and then stretch the <span class="m">velvet</span>, it appears grainy as if it was <span class="m">gold powder</span> sprinkled on top.
 
 <span class="m">Vermillion</span> ground by itself is wan and pale, but ground after <span class="m">lake</span>, it is more beautiful.
 
For taking the fattiness from <span class="tl"><span class="m">marbles</span></span>, one grinds <span class="m">ordinary ashes</span> on it, which is good afterward to make the first primer coat of a panel that is prepared in <span class="m">oil</span> in order to seal the cracks & chinks of the <span class="m">wood</span>. It has more body than <span class="m">chalk</span> & it has <span class="del"><span class="m">chalk</span></span> a certain fattiness. One mixes it with the aforesaid <span class="m">chalk</span> or <span class="del">ra</span> with the colors collected from the <span class="tl">vessel</span> where one cleans the <span class="tl">pinceaulx</span>. It is desiccative and spares colors. <span class="del">On</span> Once this primer coat is made on the <span class="m">wood</span>, one scrapes with a <span class="tl">knife</span> to even it. Next one makes a second coat of <span class="m">ceruse</span> or of the <span class="add">poorest</span> colors mixed together. In a painting in <span class="m">oil</span> <span class="add">on <span class="m">canvas</span></span>, one applies only one coat, and the same <span class="m">ashes</span> can be used there. Also, after one has ground a color, one grinds the <span class="m">inside of a large loaf of bread</span> on it to remove the fattiness from the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>.
