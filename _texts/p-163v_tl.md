## <span class="al">Crayfish</span>

 
The hairy little horns that it <span class="sup">the <span class="al">crayfish</span></span> has under its snout tend to come out lumpy and unclear because, after they are burnt, it is difficult to remove and clean away their ash, which, staying in the mold, prevents the <span class="m">metal</span> from running well. And for this reason, one makes a small gate of <span class="m">wax</span> thread at the tips of them, in order both to hold them up and to blow away the cumbersome ashes from inside.

> Do not spare any pins, placing them not only in the middle of the body, but also on the big legs, and two or three on the tail, according to the positioning that you want to give it.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Crocum</span>

 
That which has become rusty by itself, having been doused with <span class="m">water</span>, <span class="m">salt</span>, and either <span class="m">vinegar</span> or <span class="m">urine</span>, and then well—dried and reddened by heating, is deep red when crushed on <span class="m">porphyry</span> and is of the color of <span class="m">bol de levant</span>, almost like <span class="m">minium</span>. But that which is doused with <span class="m">urine</span> and dried acquires a deeper color and almost like crushed <span class="m">aes ustum</span> or like <span class="m">vermillion</span>. But the first one, finely crushed, acquires a bright red color like <span class="m">cinnabar</span> when placed in <span class="m">spirits</span>. And the one and the other, when prepared as said above, finely ground and made very hot, produce a red smoke like an acid vapor if, being thus hot and fine, one throws <span class="m">vinegar</span>, <span class="m">urine</span> or <span class="m">spirits</span> on top. The <span class="m">urine</span> makes a lot of color and the <span class="m">spirits</span> as well.

## Repairing

 
It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a burin called an "onglet" or the one called "chaple" or with a small file. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While reworking, moisten and rub your work with a small <span class="m">bristle</span> brush.
