## <span class="tl">Casting</span> <span class="pa">plants</span> and <span class="pa">flower</span> bouquets

 
 One must cast them as soon as they are picked because they wilt and dry out. Dunk them, therefore, right away in good <span class="m">spirits</span> and then put them in your <span class="tl">sand mold</span>, soaked like <span class="al">snakes</span>. There is nothing to be released <span class="sup">from the <span class="tl">mold</span>s</span> because while the <span class="tl">mold</span>s are heating up, the <span class="pa">plant</span> material burns away, which does not happen with animals, which have <span class="bp">bone</span>s. For bouquets, the sand must be finer than for <span class="al">snakes</span> because, if it were thick, it would crush the <span class="pa">flower</span>.

 burn the <span class="pa">plant</span>s, <span class="pa">flower</span>s, and <span class="al">animal</span> parts that are remaining. Afterward, they must be cleaned and the <span class="m">cinder</span> removed. Then reheat them <span class="sup">until</span> they are red for <span class="tl">casting</span>. Reheat in the beginning with some <span class="m">charcoal</span> lit over a gentle fire, and put your core <span class="tl">mold</span>s down flat on the <span class="m">charcoal</span> encircled by <span class="m">bricks</span>. <span class="tl">Molding frames</span> are reheated on a <span class="tl">grate</span>. 
 
 
  

## Core <span class="tl">molding</span> the same sand <span class="sup">for</span> <span class="m">wax</span> images, <span class="m">lead</span> medals, and similar things

 
Make sure that these are well emptied. If they are not, fill <span class="sup">them</span> with <span class="m">wax</span>, which will not be it, and then smear your <span class="m">wax</span> or <span class="m">lead</span> images with a very thin and light layer of <span class="m"><span class="pa">olive</span> oil</span> in such a way that the <span class="m">oil</span> does not give any thickness or body to the medal. Then heat it with a little <span class="m">spirits</span> and, when it is lukewarm, wet the <span class="m">oiled</span> medal, because if the <span class="m">water</span> is cold, it will resist the <span class="m">oil</span>. It will not hold on to it. After, cast your <span class="m">plaster</span> sand,<span class="m">matton</span>, and <span class="m">alum</span>. Wet it on top having placed your image on <span class="m">clay</span> mold in the shape of a mandore and having given it some contour to give the necessary thickness. These medals <span class="m">oil</span> and rub against themselves in this way with the <span class="m">spirits</span> because they are firm and hard, and they would not ready to be taken out of the <span class="tl">mold</span>, which is resistant like real <span class="al">animals</span>, which are soft and flexible.

>   When you have soaked your sand, do not cast on the middle of the <span class="tl">mold</span>, but on the edge so that the sand gently settles, so that the first <span class="m">cement</span> be clear and thick afterwards. If your soaked sand sizzles like <span class="m">water</span> falling in a <span class="tl">mold</span>, it is a sign that it is too light. Make it, then, of an average thickness. 
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Casting</span> <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>

 
 The <span class="tl">molds</span> must be fire—red and ablaze when you cast <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span> in them, or when you burn <span class="pa">flower</span>s and <span class="pa">bouquet</span>s. The gate must not be very big where the thing being cast enters because the matter will flow better without disturbing the <span class="tl">mold</span>, and does not become so filled with bubbles. 
 
 
  

## A way to <span class="m">enamel</span> very fine <span class="m">gold</span> <span class="m"><span class="pa">rose</span> leave</span>s and others

 
 After you have cast or beaten in <span class="m">gold</span> the thin <span class="m"><span class="pa">rose</span> leaves</span> or other things, if you want to <span class="m">enamel</span> them, you must solder or braze your fine <span class="m">gold</span> leaves onto <span class="m">silver</span> strips, which will strengthen them to support the <span class="m">enamel</span>. After the things has been <span class="m">enameled</span>, put the work in <span class="m">aqua fortis</span>, which will eat away the <span class="m">silver</span> and leave all the <span class="m">gold</span> with its <span class="m">enamel</span>. For this, the <span class="m">gold</span> must have been passed…
