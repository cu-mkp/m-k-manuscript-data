## <span class="tl">Molding</span> bouquets, plants and flowers

 
 One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they wilt and dry out. Dip them, therefore, immediately in good <span class="m">freau de vye</span> & then put them in your wet <span class="tl">sand</span>, like <span class="al">snakes</span>. For which one needs no release, for while the <span class="tl">mold</span>s being reheated, the <span class="pa">plant</span> burns, which does not happen with animals, which have <span class="bp">bone</span>s. It is necessary that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for <span class="al">snakes</span> because, if it were thick, it would crush the <span class="pa">flower</span>.

 burning the <span class="pa">plant</span>s, <span class="pa">flower</span>s, and <span class="al">animal</span> parts remain inside. Next one needs to clean them & remove the ashes. Secondly, reheat them & render them red for casting. At the beginning, reheat with some charcoals, gently lit, and put your noyau <span class="tl">mold</span>s flat on the <span class="m">charcoals</span> surrounded by <span class="m">bricks</span>. <span class="tl"> Frame molds</span> are reheated on a <span class="tl">grill</span>. 
 
 
  

##  Noyau<span class="tl">molding</span> with the same sand, <span class="m">wax</span> images, or <span class="m">lead</span> medals, and similar things

 
Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with <span class="m">wax</span> what does not, and then smear your images of <span class="m">wax</span> or of <span class="m">lead</span> with olive oil, very thinly & very lightly, such that the oil makes no thickness nor body on the medal.Then, heat a little <span class="m">eau de vye</span> & when it is lukewarm, moisten the <span class="m">oiled</span> medal with it, for if the <span class="m">water</span> were cold, it would reject the <span class="m">oil</span>, it would not set well. Next, cast your sand of <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="m">matton</span>, and wet <span class="m">alum</span> on top. Having arranged your image on the clay mandore & having made a circle around it to give it the necessary thickness. These medals are <span class="m">oiled</span> and rubbed thusly with <span class="m">eau de vye</span> because they are firm & hard & would not malleable for taking out of the mold, which is tenacious, as are the animals from nature, which are soft & flexible.

>   When you have wet your sand, do not throw it in the middle of the <span class="tl">mold</span>, but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently, and that the beginning is not thick & afterwards thick. If your wet sand sounds like water falling in the mold, it is a sign that is not thick enough. Make it therefore of average thickness. 
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Casting</span> for <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>

 
 It is necessary that the <span class="tl">molds</span> be fiery red & ablaze when you cast in <span class="m">gold</span> & <span class="m">silver</span> , or you burn <span class="pa">flower</span>s and <span class="pa">bouquet</span>s. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the molded thing, because the substance flows better when at ease and without shaking the mold & does not become as porous. 
 
 
  

## A way to <span class="del">unmold</span> <span class="m">enamel</span> <span class="ms"><span class="del">gold</span></span> very delicate <span class="m">gold</span> <span class="pa">rose</span> leaves and others

 
 After you have cast or beaten in <span class="m">gold</span> the thin leaves of a <span class="pa">rose</span> or other things, if you want to <span class="m">enamel</span> them, you need to <span class="m">solder</span> or braze your delicate <span class="m">gold</span> leaves onto <span class="m">silver strips</span>, which <span class="del">uy</span> will strengthen them to support the <span class="m">enamel</span>. Next, once the thing has been <span class="m">enameled</span>, put the work in <span class="m">aqua <span class="del">d</span>fortis</span>, which will eat away the <span class="m">silver</span> & leave all the <span class="m">gold</span> with its <span class="m">enamel</span>. For this, the <span class="m">gold</span> needs to be passed <span class="ill"></span>
