## <span class="m">Earth for casting, for <span class="pro">founders</span></span>

 
It renders itself fat once beaten and also mixed with <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span> dung</span>. <span class="m"><span class="pro">Potter</span>'s earth</span> would be too fat and would crack & would not hold in the fire, but one needs to mix it with <span class="ms">half the quantity</span> of sand and a <span class="ms">quarter</span> or a <span class="ms">fifth</span> of <span class="m"><span class="add"><span class="al">horse</span></span> dung</span>. And leave it to dry, then powder it, then <span class="tl">sift</span> it to render it fine & cleansed, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The <span class="m">dung</span> renders the <span class="m">earth</span> more amenable & easier to deal with, but it is necessary that it be well free of <span class="m">straw</span> & other things. And when the <span class="m">earth</span> is very fat, one needs to give it more sand & more <span class="m">dung</span>. But one does find fat varieties of <span class="m">earth</span>, themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, make them so artificially. One always needs to reheat the <span class="m">earths</span> before casting.

 
  

## Garden lily

 
If it is broken during its first blossom, it will not grow or bloom until the following year, and I believe it is the same for bulbous flowers [in general].

 
  

## Sand

 
The sand chosen <span class="del">cast</span> for casting should be neither so lean that it has no stickiness, nor too fat. And even if it is found <span class="env"><span class="m">in nature</span></span>, however, it is not everywhere. And if you are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with <span class="m">fat earth</span>, for the sand does not want any of that, for it makes it very porous. But you can make it bindable with <span class="m">brick well ground</span> on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, or <span class="m">plaster</span> or <span class="m">calcinated alabaster</span> or something similar, or the <span class="m">burned marrow of <span class="al">ox</span> horn</span> or <span class="m">burned asphalt</span>. If you grind it quite finely on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, it <span class="del">s</span> acquires stickiness better & then you can burn it with <span class="m">asphalt</span> or mix it with a <span class="ms">quarter part</span> of <span class="m">tripoli</span>. Guard against <span class="m">bread</span> falling into your sand because it makes it very porous.

## <span class="al">Ducks</span>

 
Young domestic ones do not grow for a month after hatching but remain in this state. But after, they soon grow up, even if they go into the water. They are fed boiled <span class="m">millet grains</span>, to which are added crumbled <span class="m">bread</span> and finely chopped <span class="m">lettuce</span>.
