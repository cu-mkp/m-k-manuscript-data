## Regulus extracts

 
Take one pound of <span class="m">antimony</span>, half a pound of <span class="m">black soap,</span> and half a pound of <span class="m">Montpellier tartar</span>. Once it is all pulverized, you have to boil it in a <span class="m">varnished earthenware pot</span> on a big <span class="m">fire</span> as you stir it with a <span class="m">piece of wood or iron</span>. The <span class="m">soap</span> will burn off and be consumed by the <span class="m">fire</span> and the rest will stay red. The quantity has to be reduced to a third. Then throw that on a <span class="m">tile</span> and it will turn blackish. You will have to melt and pour that on a <span class="m">tile</span> four or five times and then you will have <span class="m">regulin from antimony</span>.
 
Others pulverise the <span class="m">antimony</span> and mix it with equal quantities of <span class="m">saltpeter</span> and powdered <span class="m">tartar</span> and heat a <span class="m">pot</span> or <span class="m">crucible</span> until it is red hot, then add a little bit at a time, turning their back for fear of the smoke, and keep doing so until everything is added. They maintain the <span class="m">fire</span> until everything is completely melted and melt that several times.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lead</span>, <span class="m">tin</span>

 
They become brittle having been put back to melt, often or for a long time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one melts a saulmon, the <span class="m">tin</span> thickens at the bottom if, while casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to melt a little <span class="m">lead</span> <span class="del">& the</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> & <span class="del">remuer</span> to renew at each melting. The <span class="m">antimony</span> renders them breakable. The <span class="m">looking glass tin</span> whitens them. <span class="del">One</span> <span class="pro">Pewterers</span> put in <span class="del">on the <span class="m">fine tin</span></span> one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">looking glass tin</span> per one <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">fine tin</span> & two <span class="ms">lb</span> & a half or three <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">red & soft copper of cauldrons</span>, which is better than <span class="m">latten.</span> There is <span class="m">fine & soft tin</span> & <span class="m">brittle tin</span>. The brittle one is cast in <span class="tl">grille</span> by the <span class="pro">pewterers</span> to sell it better. <span class="del">O</span> They come out better & more neatly in <span class="tl"><span class="m">stone</span> moulds</span> than in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> mold</span>, because <span class="m">copper</span> is fat & sticks unless one heats the <span class="tl">mold</span> well or one casts large works. Three <span class="ms">quarters</span> of <span class="m">lead</span> per one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">soft tin</span>, makes a very liquid line & proper for casting, which has a shine like a mirror. <span class="m">Tallow for glass</span> lightens them. All things that lightens well <span class="m">metals</span> & remove their thickness & dense nature & render them <span class="del">like</span> liquid like <span class="m">water</span>, render them proper for casting, for it is the thickness that prevents them from running. <span class="m">Soft tin</span> is more even <span class="del">com</span> than the <span class="m">brittle one</span>, which is whiter and seems to be burnished like a mirror.

>   To alloy well <span class="m">tin</span> & <span class="m">lead</span>, one needs to melt one by itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it often on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> or the <span class="tl"><span class="m">square tile</span></span>. And when you will see it become well even <span class="del">like</span> & shiny as if it were burnished, it is good. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much <span class="m">lead</span> & sometimes due to too much <span class="m">tin</span>. There is some <span class="m">tin</span> that has more <span class="m">lead</span> than others. <span class="m">Common tin</span> is the one that is mixed with <span class="m">lead</span>.
