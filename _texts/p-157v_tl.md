## Ashes in the moulds

 
You must let the mold cool down rather than blow into it to try to get the ashes out. Because when the mold is hot, the ashes stick to it, and when it cold, they separate from it more easily, and will exit by blowing with le vent a vapeur.

 
  

## Moulding a <span class="al">bird</span>

 
You must give it its pose. And to do so, place it on its side on a <span class="m">clay</span> base and hide it in the aforesaid <span class="m">clay</span> base and sink half the aforesaid <span class="al">bird</span> in it, so that it is only showing one leg and foot, then you will apply <span class="m">butter</span> to keep the feathers down and then apply some <span class="m">spirits</span>. Then cast it. And having taken hold, clean and uncover what needs to be uncovered. Because the feet are made of bones which are hard to burn, and which will not be able to be cleaned neither with <span class="m">quicksilver</span>, nor by any other means, if the mold does not open, uncover the bottom of the foot and the toe, or the nail of the claw, and mold <span class="sup">it with</span>a separate piece. Make a second cooking and open your mold and clean the bones. Feet generally remain <span class="sup">too</span> weak to support the a heavy <span class="al">bird</span>. Because of this one adapts an <span class="m">iron</span> thread in the foot mold which goes through the body before you cast. In this way they are reinforced. Some mold the wings in a frame. Some mold the head and the aforesaid wings separately en noyau, then reattach and repair them to start shaping <span class="sup"><span class="al">the bird</span></span>, which will firstly have a rigid shape and support the tempered sand.

> They are skinned and filled with <span class="m">cotton cloth</span>. And for the best result, you must prepare it in the way that <span class="pro">leather—workers</span> do, so that they do not lose their comely feathers. The preparation is made of <span class="m">alum</span> and <span class="m">flour paste</span>.
