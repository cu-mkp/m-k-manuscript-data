The <span class="m">gold</span> handles are made with some <span class="m">yellow thin cloth</span> set below or other kind of <span class="m">chalk—yellowed fabric</span>. And this <span class="m">cloth</span> is set on with <span class="m">glue</span> or aforesaid <span class="m">gum</span>. This is in order to make the <span class="m">thread</span> hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the <span class="m">silk</span> ones and between two cordons are put one or two <span class="m">threads</span> to enhance it. The <span class="m">silver</span> one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the <span class="m">silk</span> one, not because <span class="m">silk</span> is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine <span class="m">gold</span> handle is worth 28 or 20 cents.
 
The best sword point is of <span class="m">sage foliage</span>.
 
This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in order to furbish is called the chameau. It is commonly made from <span class="m">rowan</span> which is hard and even.
 
The stick underneath which is folded bow—like is called the arch.
 
The stick above is called stick of the fustée.
 
And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called the fustée.
 
There are two horns, one is called the <span class="m">oil</span> hornet and the other the <span class="m">emery</span> hornet. 
 
There is an <span class="m">iron</span> tool with the shape of a halberd point, square and made of very even and well limed <span class="m">steel</span> called the grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with <span class="m">stone</span> or other tools which leave some scratches.
 
To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also sharpened.
 
<span class="pro">Those who create sword hilts</span> are different craftsmen than <span class="pro">furbishers</span>.
 
The fustée is a three—finger—thick, square <span class="m">wood</span> tool, made of <span class="m">boxwood</span> which fit in the middle of the fustée stick to furbish.
 
The fresil stick is made of <span class="m">willow wood</span> which is to […] weapon with some <span class="m">clinker</span> which is the <span class="m">iron scale</span> falling from the <span class="pro">blacksmiths</span>' forge.
