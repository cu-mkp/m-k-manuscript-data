## For <span class="m">earth</span> walls and rustic construction

 
<span class="al">Swallows</span> have taught us this craft by building their nests out of <span class="m">mud</span> mingled with <span class="m">wisps</span> and bits of <span class="m">hay</span> or <span class="m">straw</span> to make it bond. Therefore, in places where <span class="m">stones</span> and <span class="m">bricks</span> are lacking, one can use <span class="m">earth</span> to make walls thin and thick. The best for this is light <span class="m">earth</span>, which does not form clumps when plowed, or better, that which in some way mingled with <span class="m">arene</span>, because it can be most easily beaten and tamped down. It is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into clumps with a <span class="tl">ditch—spade</span>, and put and placed in this form. This one lasts more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn't make it split or crack. However, since such kinds of earth are not found everywhere, those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the width and length of their foundations with a <span class="tl">rope</span>, drive in long <span class="tl">poles</span> and <span class="tl">rafters</span> along the edges on each side to support boards between which they throw the <span class="m">earth</span>, making each layer about one foot thick, interspersed with S.S.S—shaped branches of <span class="m"><span class="pa">heather</span></span> or similar things, then they tamp it down and beat it with beaters of three different forms. One is called the mall, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used firstly to tamp down the <span class="m">earth</span>. Then one uses another made of pointed <span class="tl">woodblocks</span> fitted onto a thick <span class="tl">stick</span>, and this one is used to properly press the <span class="m">earth</span> at the wall’s ends and edges where they adhere to the boards, and is called [blank]. The other one is called the bat and is used to flatten and beat the <span class="m">earth</span> for the last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of <span class="m">earth</span> and <span class="m"><span class="pa">heather</span></span> and beats as has been said, and continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with <span class="m"><span class="pa">heather</span></span> and then with <span class="m">earth</span>. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of <span class="m">bricks</span>. They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it whitens, showing that it has <span class="m">saltpeter</span> in it. Which is why, when they fall down, <span class="pro">gunpowder makers</span> profit from them.
