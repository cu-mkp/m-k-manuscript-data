 You will see that it will stir it and heat it intensely and soon will make it quite liquid and ready to cast, and lighten it as it should.When it is in that state, very white and polished, shiny like quicksilver, be ready to cast. To that end, have thin, diluted sand in a pot or other vessel, which will be helpful to your mixture. Make a hole in your sand, and with you pincers put your red hot mold in this sand hole. Cover immediately the opening of your mold so that no ash or dust enters in it, and then surround it with sand up to the level of the gate and the vents. This done, peel off you mold and cast you well molten <span class="m">silver</span>, the size of a pea of this metallic grain, which will immediately spread your <span class="m">silver</span> all over, making it boil and cover everything. Cast as soon as you have spread this matter; that is the secret to make <span class="m">silver</span> run, because its crust heats up and lightens it up. You can cast <span class="m">silver</span> thinner than the Capital league [norm], as the royal one.

Keep it from [illegible] that be laid at the very end of your forge.

## Whitening of cast <span class="m">silver</span>

 
 People, even <span class="pl">German</span> people, commonly cast <span class="m">silver</span> of poor quality. Because this kind of alloy produces defects and crusts, some <span class="m">silversmiths</span> are eager to whiten their works, including the coarser ones. To do this they mix an equal part of <span class="m">tartar</span> and <span class="m">common salt</span> in their bullitoyre. I saw an excellent German working that way. In my presence, he casted a lizard with a teston league alloy, which had produced a dirty crust. To clean it, this German boiled it in a bullitoyre with <span class="m">tartar</span> and powdered <span class="m">common salt</span> mixed with common <span class="m">water</span> on the fire of his forge. Then he scrubbed it because he thought it was not neat enough. From this crust he burned <span class="m">tartar</span> on a piece of <span class="m">paper</span> until it was black and did not smoke anymore. Then he diluted this <span class="m">tartar</span> into the <span class="m">water</span> form the bullitoyre, and covered all his <span class="al">lizard</span> with this. Then he put the <span class="al">lizard</span> between red hot charcoals in the forge, and he blew a bit. When the <span class="al">lizard</span> became red, he removed it, let it cool, then reheated it with the bullitoyre mixture, and scrubbed it into clear water.

>   \+ Note that the bullitoyre for <span class="m">silver</span> is not appropriate to use in a crucible because the <span class="m">tartar</span> evaporates. But the vessel, being made of <span class="m">copper</span>, is excellent to whiten <span class="m">silver</span> and for the mixture which colors <span class="m">gold</span>.

>   He made sure that his <span class="m">tartar water</span> would not boil over, because its strength would disappear, so when this first boiling happens, remove it from the fire and put it on again. He held this burned <span class="m">tartar</span> mixture put on low quality <span class="m">silver</span> to be a secret.
