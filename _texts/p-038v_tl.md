## Black color for dyeing 

 
Take <span class="m">lye made from quicklime</span> and <span class="m">white lead</span>, mix and leave to soak and you will have a dark brown dye, and reiterating the same you will make black. Try other colours with the <span class="m">lye made of lime</span>.
 
 
  

## Against nose bleeding and for dyeing

 
Pound some of the kind of <span class="m">vinete</span> or <span class="m">lapathum acutum</span> that is red—veined, which is called <span class="m">dragon's blood</span>, and apply it on the bleeding person's forehead. This herb is a strong dye & makes beautiful violet.
 
 
  

## Beautiful artichokes

 
You need to trim them every year so that only one stem is left, and water them a lot. Also plant some more every year, because the second year they will bear very beautiful fruits.
 
 
  

## Planting trees 

 
It is said that rarely a tree planted on Saint Paul's day will fail to take. To cover the young shoots, oxen manure is very appropriate, for it doesn't come apart in the rain like earth.
 
 
  

## Merchants 

 
Those who retail velvet and other materials do not keep double—entry books because they sell in small quantities and <span class="sup">recording</span> these details would be too much effort. They only have their sales book and account books. But those who sell in bulk and those who traffic in woad have a double—entry book.
 
 
  

## Crimson

 
Because one aulne costs seven or eight lb. to dye, they use <span class="sup">cloth</span>worth seven or eight francs. But if one wants something beautiful, one should buy some white cloth worth fifteen francs an aulne and dye it with some pure crimson woad & a little cochineal. Black fabrics are very fine because the dye is inexpensive.
