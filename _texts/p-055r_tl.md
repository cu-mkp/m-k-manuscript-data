Warm up the barrel and close the lumiere d'embas, and take a piece of the freshest <span class="m"><span class="al">pork</span>suint</span> that you can find and as long as the phalanx of your little finger and the size of the diameter of the canon, and push it back and forth until it is completely melted.

The <span class="al">snails</span> will first survive thanks to the <span class="m">egg yolks</span>, then with the heat they will come out of their shells and eat live on it.
