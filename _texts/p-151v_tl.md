However, do not remove it before you have prepared the whole <span class="al">turtle</span>, because you will use this <span class="m">earth</span> as <span class="m">cement</span>, should you need embed something or make repairs with a chisel. If you have some metal overflow at the joints of your mold, you will remove it, either with a burin, called a chaple, or with a very sharp pen—knife, or with a small file followed by the chisel. Always keeping in front of you the real thing to do as best you can. You can curl on a file a chisel point, which is not at all moistened, to make something lumpy. For these <span class="al">turtles</span> and any other hollow things which you can assume are quite big, create a <span class="m">ligue</span> of half <span class="m">lead</span> and half <span class="m">refined tin</span>. There is more to do when molding a <span class="al">turtle</span> than when molding a dozen flowers. If there is <span class="m">crocum</span> in your sand, there will be no metal overflow and if you are unfortunate enough that there should be some on the sides, these will be as thin as <span class="m">paper</span>, as long as your mold is very tightly pressed together. And to make the scales of <span class="al">turtles</span> and other animals, you can make little chisel marks in the shape of round punch cutters, others in the shape of a gouge, or shaped like a <span class="al">snake</span> or <span class="al">lizard</span> scale, and other using a file used to make twisty bits and lumps. <span class="al">Turtles</span> that do not need to be molded hollow are not as much work, because they are molded in two pieces and repair them with little chisels <span class="sup">that make</span> punch cutters, little couge, and serrated chisels.

## <span class="m">Wheat oil</span>

 
You must make it between two empty <span class="m">iron</span> blades, the bottom one in particular will be slanted downwards and on this one you will put an even and equal <span class="sup">layer</span> of <span class="m">wheat</span>. Then you will place on it the other <span class="sup">blade</span>, which is very hot, and you will press it down until you see the black <span class="m">oil</span> drip. Remove the top blade when you have enough. This <span class="m">oil</span> dries very quickly. It gilds <span class="m">silver</span> and varnished things, deepens the color of gilded things, <span class="sup">can be used</span> as a <span class="m">varnish</span> on <span class="m">iron</span> before you engrave it, and to varnish the tanned <span class="sup"><span class="m">leather</span> parts</span> of sword hilts. And it could also be used by <span class="pro">those who make gilded <span class="m">leather</span></span>.

> You must use this, as has been done recently. And for things you need to mold, it must not be as thick as for dyeing.

> You cannot use this to oil hairy animals, because it is too strong and rigid, but it is good to apply to the foot of a little animal, like a <span class="al">fly</span> and other similar things. It is also excellent to dye white stones <span class="ill"></span>
