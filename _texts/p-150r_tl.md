## Very strong <span class="m">wax</span>

 
Mix with this some <span class="m">resin</span> and <span class="m">bole</span>. Do not cast very hot.

 
  

## Diverse ligues of <span class="m">tin</span> and <span class="m">lead</span>

 
For hollow things like <span class="al">turtles</span>, <span class="sup">use</span> half refined <span class="m">lead</span> and half <span class="m">tin</span>.
 
For flowers, <span class="sup">use</span> almost all <span class="m">lead</span>, that is to say, a lb of refined <span class="m">tin</span>, and two ℥ of refined <span class="m">lead</span>.
 
For <span class="al">lizards</span> that are as thick as one or two fingers, <span class="sup">use</span> almost all <span class="m">lead</span>, that is to say, a lb of refined <span class="m">lead</span> and 4 ℥ of refined <span class="m">tin</span>.

 
  

## Moulds

 
They are less prone to cracking while reheating when they are very thick, rather than thin, provided that thickness is sufficient. Because when they are thin, they do not need to be fired for long, and prolonged exposure to heat corrupts them. The same thing will happen if you <span class="m">plaster</span> is not strong.
 
It is better to reheat one mold on its own, rather than heating it with others, because should this be the case, you will need a stronger and hotter fire, than for just the one <span class="sup">mold</span>. And because <span class="m">charcoal</span> will accumulate between multiple molds, the heat will transfer from mold to mold in such a way that you will often find that your molds have burst and crack on one side more than the other.
 
Therefore reheat your molds, not applying fire, except to cover it.
 
And because your <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span> become brittle when melting the over high heat, in order to make them less brittle, heat them over low heat, and cast in stick form.
 
Brick cools the <span class="m">metal</span>, and if this is not for binding, it is not necessary.

> The reheated moulds cannot withstand several casts, but the ones in which you only cast <span class="m">tin</span> or <span class="m">lead</span> and flat medals, these being dry, withstand a lot of casts.

> <span class="m">Iron filings</span> being finely ground, makes them <span class="sup">molds</span> very firm and strong.
