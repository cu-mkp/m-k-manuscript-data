In the year fifteen hundred seventy—eight, the second of July, the heirs of the late Sr. Ouvryer received (two hundred and five ecus), the rent of Saint—Frajou, amounting to twelve hundred and thirty livres.
 
They have also received, as part of the revenue of the year fifteen hundred seventy nine, three hundred forty three and one third ecus.
 
And for the first year, they remain [to be paid] eighty livres and fifteen sous, | and for the second settlement, they have not yet received anything.
 
 
  

## Against plague

 
Against pestilential fever or poison or plague, take an ecu's weight of your <span class="m">opiate</span> soaked in <span class="m">scabious</span> or <span class="m">bugloss extract,</span> or heavily diluted <span class="m">wine</span>, if you are already ill. After taking it, you must make yourself sweat.
 
 
  

## To preserve oneself

 
<span class="m">Acetum</span> paratum ex <span class="m">ruta</span> <span class="m">baccis juniperi</span> simul tusis Eo<br/><span class="m">aceto</span> extinguantur <span class="m">lateres</span> igniti. Et vapor excipiatur ore [&]<br/>naribus. <span class="m">Rue</span> <span class="m">vinegar</span> together with crushed <span class="m">juniper berries</span>. Pour the <span class="m">vinegar</span> over red hot <span class="m">bricks</span> and inhale the vapor through the mouth and nostrils. This is to preserve oneself when going into noxious air: a garment can be perfumed with this vapor in order to remove infection from a room, house, etc. And if you find yourself in a place where you do not have this preparation, carry <span class="m">rue</span> and <span class="m">berries</span> crushed together, then, if need be, boil them in <span class="m">vinegar</span> and use as described.
