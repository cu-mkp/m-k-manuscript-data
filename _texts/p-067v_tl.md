## <span class="tl">Files</span>

 
If they are not trempées à pacquet, that is, in the manner described, with <span class="m">soot</span>, <span class="m">salt</span>, & <span class="m">vinegar</span>, they will not be good. The large <span class="tl">square files</span> used by <span class="pro">locksmiths</span> to draft their work are only made of <span class="m">fer doulx</span>, But the <span class="tl">soft files</span> should be made of <span class="m">steel</span>. <span class="pro">Founders</span> whose work is to repair <span class="m">latten</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> should have their files coarse otherwise they fill up with <span class="m">copper</span> which makes them smooth & soon renders them useless. <span class="m">Latten</span>, which is more brittle, welcomes softer files than <span class="m">copper</span> does.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Oxen</span> foot bones for sand</span>

 
Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the flame of <span class="m">straw</span>. But if you mold them in a noyau, give it its first layer, simple & very thin, with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, & leave to dry at ease. Next fortify the following layers with <span class="m">wadding</span> mixed with the said tempered <span class="m">bone sand</span>.

>   It is the neatest sand that can be found for <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Huiles d'essence</span>

 
<span class="m"><span class="add"><span class="pa">Walnut</span></span> oil</span> mixed with as much of <span class="m">turpentine</span> & distilled by an <span class="tl">alembic</span> renders an essence whiter than <span class="m">common water</span>. But this has no body & does not give a bond for colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves the color without stickiness and faded. These, imbibed in this way, would not let you work or soften, no more than in <span class="m">distemper</span>. But you rectify this fault, by giving it a little body with <span class="m">turpentine</span>, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can work with <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span> & will make a perfect <span class="m">lead white</span>. <span class="m">Turpentine varnish</span> made with this <span class="m">oil</span> is dry in one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span>.
