## <span class="m">Mericoton</span> and <span class="m">pavis</span>

 
One should graft them before Christmas so that they will not freeze too much.
 
 
  

## White bronzing on <span class="m">plaster</span>

 
One must apply four layers of <span class="pro">painters</span>' <span class="m">distemper glue</span> onto the <span class="m">plaster</span> portrait, leaving one layer to dry at a time. Then apply gently some burnt <span class="m">English point</span> ground on a marble slab, or some <span class="m">lead</span> burnt, ground and distempered with a bit of <span class="m">gum</span> or <span class="m">glue</span>. When dry, rub gently with a little <span class="m">cotton</span> and the <span class="m">plaster</span> portrait will look like <span class="m">lead</span>. Others grind <span class="m">minium</span> with <span class="m">quicksilver</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Purpurine</span>

 
The soft <span class="m">tin</span>, <span class="ms">half an ounce</span> of, melt it in a <span class="tl">spoon</span>. Once melted, throw in an <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">☿</span>, mix together. Once cold, grind on <span class="m">porphyry</span>. Next take an <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, an <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">sulfur</span>, the yellowest that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a <span class="del">a pignatta</span> <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> sublimatorium</span>, hold this over a small fire for an <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span> & for an <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span> over a stronger one & for an <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span> over a very strong fire, and it will be done. Next, to use it, apply <span class="m">soot black</span> with the <span class="m">glue</span> that <span class="pro">painters</span> use to paint, <span class="del">&</span> two or three times, until it is quite black. Next apply a little <span class="m">varnish</span>. Once dry, apply the <span class="m">purpurine</span> a secco with a <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> where you want. The more you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if you want, apply <span class="m">varnish</span> on top.
 
 
  

## White bronzing

 
Apply black with <span class="m">glue</span>, as was said, on the medal, then <span class="m">varnish</span>. Once dry, grate <span class="m">mine d'<span class="pl">Angleterre</span></span> on top with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> or a <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>. The said grated <span class="m">mine</span> embellishes <span class="m">lead</span> medals.
