## Molding hollow

 
This <span class="m">iron</span> thread needle which you put thusly in the mold, is to better secure the noyau and keep it from shifting. All of this having been thusly arranged, lay your mold on the table, hole facing upwards, as it is explained at the side. And then fashion a circle made of soft <span class="m">clay</span>, of about two fingers high around the hole, as you have done with other molds. And then temper your molding sand to an average thickness, and throw it in the hole until it <span class="sup">mold</span> is very very full, that is to say until you reach the <span class="m">clay</span> circle. Be advised not to throw it <span class="sup">sand</span> in the middle of the hole, but from the sides, because the already made mold, will drink and suck the moisture. And the new sand that you throw on the sides of the mold, because drying quickly, will plug the mold and not <span class="sup">leave you enough time</span> to fill up. Whereas if you throw it <span class="sup">the sand</span> from the side, when you realize <span class="sup">it is drying too quickly</span> and plugs up, you can make a path for it. Having thrown it in, blow on the tempered sand, and insert the tip of your finger in the hole a few times, or some kind of pointy thing to keep it moist, in order to make sure that the hollow <span class="m">wax</span> does not fill up. At the end throw in the thicker tempered sand to strengthen the mold, because when <span class="m">water</span> rises up to the edge of the mold, it always makes it softer. Having taken hold, get rid of the <span class="m">clay</span> circle and any raised parts that relate to the hole through which you threw the noyau, and you will not even realize the process took place. Once your mold has been thusly prepared, lute its outside with the same sand that you used to make the mold. Then reheat it on with a low heat to begin with, slant the mouth of the cast downwards so that the <span class="m">wax</span> trickles out slowly, because if you reheat it over very high heat to make the <span class="m">wax</span> come out, it will boil inside it <span class="sup">the mold</span>, and will leave blisters and lumpy bits on it <span class="sup">the cast</span>, as long as

>   This <span class="m">iron</span> thread needle is placed in the middle and the hole of the cast, when the mold is in many pieces, as is the one for <span class="al">turtles</span>. And you do this so that the noyau does not shift. But when the mold is made out of only two pieces, it is not necessary to put needles in the middle.

> Rather than cast the noyau, make some notches around the edge of the hole through which you would like to cast, so that your mold is even more secure.

Because the less <span class="m">wax</span> you have on it, the better it is, because it will reboil when you reheat your mold, and you will get blisters and lumps. And if you have little <span class="m">wax</span> left <span class="sup">in the mold</span> you will not need to reheat it as much. When you open your mold the cast will break. But it can easily be repaired as long as you castA
