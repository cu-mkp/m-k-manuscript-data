## Working neatly

 
Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But after you have made your design carefully, keep the space for shadows alone by themselves & for the lights & highlights individually as well, without layering a color all across & then highlighting or shading on it. And in this way, you further your work, economise your colours & work neatly, which is the reason that, the colors not being muddled nor mixed together, they do not die & you soften the colors better, since they are not so thick.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Fatty oil</span>

 
It is not good for working with colors because it makes them thick, & as difficult to work as <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span>. Use, then, the <span class="m">clearest <span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> that you can, & the freshest.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Vermilion</span>

 
One ought not to keep it in <span class="m">water</span> when <span class="del">soaked</span> <span class="add">ground</span> with <span class="m">oil</span> for it loses its color. It is better to choose whitish <span class="m">vermilion</span> than dark & blackish. For <span class="m">vermilion</span> is usually mixed with a little <span class="m">lake</span>, without which it would hardly be different from <span class="m">minium</span>. But the pale kind one casts more vivacity than the dark one. It is not desiccative, & for this reason one mixes in <span class="m">calcined cristallin</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Oil</span> colors in <span class="m">water</span>

 
Usually, after grinding them one puts a <span class="del">fo</span> piece of <span class="m">tin leaf</span> on top, & one puts them in <span class="m">water</span> to prevent them from drying out. But this is more appropriate for <span class="m">ceruse</span>, <span class="m">lead white</span>, <span class="m">minium</span> & <span class="m">massicot</span> than for the others, for <span class="m">lake</span> dies there & loses its color, as does <span class="m">azure vermilion</span>.
 
 
  

## Double layer

 
<span class="m">Ver<span class="add">digris</span></span> does not die, & thus does not need to be layered twice. But <span class="m">lake</span> & others, & especially flesh color, <span class="del">the</span> require two layers. Colors hardly change when they are dry.

** <span class="m">Yellow ochre</span> **

 
 One needs a little of it in every flesh color.

** Softening **

 
 One softens in the same way on <span class="m">oiled paper</span> as on <span class="m">wood</span>. But it is easier to soften on <span class="m">canvas</span>, because the softening must be rougher on it.

** Eye **

 
 Every eye must follow the circle of the <span class="tl">compass</span> & not be flat & square.
