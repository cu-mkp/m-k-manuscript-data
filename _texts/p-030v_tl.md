any dish or plate, they loosen & undo with the strike of a <span class="tl">hammer</span> the <span class="m">iron</span> wedges that slide along the spokes of the <span class="tl">wheel</span>. And, when they are at the notch and points that they need, they tighten the said wedges, striking them with the <span class="tl">hammer</span>.
 
When their plates or dishes have been cast, soldered if needed, & recleansed of surrounding froth with the hot <span class="tl">soldering iron</span> & then with a big <span class="tl">file</span>, they adapt it on the <span class="tl">wheel</span> & first of all they wrap their <span class="del"><span class="tl">desgrusoue</span></span> <span class="tl">desgrusouer</span> with a <span class="tl">rope</span>, as thick <span class="del"><span class="tl">rope</span></span> as the <span class="ms"><span class="bp">little finger</span></span>, & lean it firmly on the <span class="tl">crossbar</span> to secure it well. And while someone else promptly turns the <span class="tl">wheel</span>, they guide the sharp edge of the <span class="tl">esgrusouer</span> by <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hand</span></span> <span class="del">s</span> towards the edge of the round cavity, & gently guide it to the center of the circle. And this <span class="tl">desgrusouer</span> is for removing the first rough & lumpy skins of the work. And next they even it out with a <span class="tl">cutting <span class="m">iron</span></span> called a <span class="tl">plane</span>, on which they rub the sharp edge with a little <span class="m">putty</span>, on <span class="m">leather</span> <span class="tl">nailed</span> onto a piece of <span class="m">wood</span> <span class="del">having</span>, and this, in such a way that the flesh or grain is on the outside, for if the sharp edge of this <span class="tl">plane</span> was not thus rubbed & burnished, it would not polish & <span class="del">not</span>burnish the <span class="m">tin</span>, <span class="del">au</span> which would stay white, & not black & polished like a mirror. Moreover, they repair the work for the second time with this <span class="tl">plane</span> as they did with the <span class="tl">esgrusouer</span>. Then, with a <span class="tl">knife</span> or another <span class="tl">sharp <span class="m">iron</span></span>, they scrape the edges of the plates or dishes to smooth them so that they are not found sharp when handled
