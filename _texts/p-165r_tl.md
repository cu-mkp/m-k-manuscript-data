## To repair

 
If in your cast, there appear some little hole, fix it with black or gray filling <span class="m">gum wax</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lacquer</span>

 
If, having been ground, you let it dry without keeping it in <span class="m">water</span>, it will dry out and it will be quite difficult to crush it as before.
 
 
  

## Stretching a <span class="m">canvas</span> portrait

 
If it is crumpled or folded from when it was rolled up, moisten the back side with a wet sponge. Then stretch it very evenly without damaging it.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Plaster</span> for molding

 
When it is long to set and dry, it means that it is too fat and moist, which is what makes it shrink away from the fire and crack. <span class="x">This is</span> where burrs come from. The one that comes from lean <span class="m">earth</span> is better. You must not store your moulds made of fat <span class="m">plaster</span> for a long time, because they resemble fat <span class="m">earth</span>, which when drying, cracks. The best is to reheat them soon after they have been made and cast. Moulds made of good <span class="m">plaster</span> can be stored a long time.

>   It is necessary to <span class="m">oil</span>it well, because it is more difficult to separate the two halves of these moulds than when it is mixed.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Dragon</span>'s blood</span>

 
You can imitate <span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood with <span class="m">lacquer</span>, which surpasses it in beauty, if <span class="x">when</span> diluted in <span class="m">oil</span>, you use it to ice <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span>. Diluted with varnish, it fades.
 
 
  

## Repairing <span class="al">snakes</span> and <span class="al">lizards</span>

 
You could make some marks according to the form of their scales, making some bigger ones and some smaller ones, according to the shape of the neck, the body and the tail. If there is something broken, you can attach it with small <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">steel</span> nails, and glue it with some <span class="m">mouth glue</span>, then cover the whole thing with gray or black <span class="m">wax</span>. But it is necessary to let the <span class="m">glue</span> dry for one day without touching it.
