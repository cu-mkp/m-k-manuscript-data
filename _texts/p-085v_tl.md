## <span class="pro">Founder</span>

 
They mix <span class="m">beaten egg glair</span> with <span class="m">earth with which they make the first layer of the chappe of pieces, & bells, & all other pieces</span>, saying that the said <span class="m">glair</span> makes it come out <span class="del">d</span> neatly, & makes it settle, & seats the substance. In the noyau for a small work, <span class="m">glair</span> is also good.
 
<span class="m">Rosette</span>, to come out neatly, wants the <span class="tl">mold</span> to be a little hot & <span class="m">lead</span>, which was also mixed with the <span class="m">rosette</span>, similarly for small pieces.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Mortars</span>

 
They should be of the finest material possible. <span class="sup">In the same way</span>, it is better to use <span class="m">copper for a cauldron</span> than <span class="m">red copper</span>, because it better resists a blow.
 
The mortars, therefore, used for grinding are stronger & there is less danger of breaking them if they are of <span class="m">fine copper</span>. And for a private home, they do not ring so much & do not make as much noise as those of <span class="m">metal</span>. It is true that those that are of <span class="m">metal</span> ring louder for <span class="pro">apothecaries</span>.
 
Grenades must be made from fine <span class="m">metal</span>
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand from a <span class="env">mine</span></span>

 
It wants to be well reheated for <span class="m">great metals</span>. Some burn it in the <span class="tl">furnace</span> until it is very black, and grind it finely on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>. Others burn it with <span class="m">asphaltum</span>, @but when it is too burned, it does not mold so neatly, because it does not have body, and is too lean. You can give some with <span class="m">tripoly</span> or <span class="m">burned felt</span>.
 
 
  

## Experiments with sand 

 
I have experimented with <span class="m">sand from <span class="pl">Th<span class="exp">oulous</span>e</span></span>, & after having reheated it well, twice, in a <span class="tl">skillet</span>, I passed it through a <span class="tl">fine sieve</span>, like <span class="tl">the <span class="pro">apothecaries</span>’ double</span>, without finely grinding it further on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, as I have done previously. I moistened it with <span class="m">wine boiled with <span class="pa">elm</span> root</span>, and molded with it a large piece of a portrait of <span class="pn">Jesus</span>. I found it easy to release, without having it to knock on it <span class="del">Jen</span> & molded neatly with one side in relief, & on the other in cavity, & of the <span class="ms">thickness of a coin of forty <span class="cn">sols</span></span>. I cast very hot

>  <span class="m">Sand from a mine</span>, well chosen & well reheated, is the most excellent of all, without looking for any other mixtures, because it receives all <span class="m">metals</span>. It does not want to be used hot, because it makes things porous. The most finely ground for big works is not the best, because it does have enough body to withstand
