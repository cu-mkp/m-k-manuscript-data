## On <span class="pro">cannon—makers</span>

 
 A cannon has a range of five to six hundred <span class="ms">paces</span>, but for a battery, the range is a maximum of two or three hundred <span class="ms">paces</span> to be effective. It should not be any farther. Its cannonball usually weighs 40 <span class="ms">lb</span> of the King's standard. The fowler weighs 25 <span class="ms">quintals</span> and is a small, short cannon for fighting the casemates of moats and at close range. It shoots large cannonballs that weigh, like the others, 40 <span class="ms">lb</span> of the King's standard. The breech is two balls and a quarter thick; the mouth is one ball and a third thick. Its load is similar to the biggest ones, that is to say 20 <span class="ms">pounds</span>. And if you want to try it, don't overload it, for it would damage it. And the first time and the first five or six shots, it is better not to load it completely, it adjusts itself. What one can do in such a case, is to load 20 <span class="ms">pounds</span> of fine arquebus <span class="m">powder</span> instead of ordinary cannon <span class="m">powder</span>. And four good <span class="al">horses</span> are enough to carry it. They are easy to use and on a small distance they are as strong as the big ones even for private houses and small billattes and less important fortresses. They are less prone to breaking than other <span class="sup">cannons</span> because they are short. What gives strength to the <span class="m">powder</span> and increases the danger of breaking is the length of the cannon, because the <span class="m">powder</span> burns entirely and its force is held longer within the longer cannon than the short one. The fowler is usually seven to eight <span class="ms">pans</span> long. It is true that this measure is a <span class="ms"><span class="pl">Montpellier</span> pan</span> and not a <span class="ms">King's pan</span>, the latter is not used for good cannon founding. Since the <span class="ms"><span class="pl">Montpellier</span> pan</span> is shorter, cannons made using this measure are shorter, but compensate in thickness the ones made using the <span class="ms">King's pan</span>, which are longer, but more fragile. The Fowler's strength for battery is 80 <span class="ms">pans</span>.

>   The great cannon, because of its cannonball's weight, ranges not further than a thousand or twelve hundred <span class="ms">paces</span> without landing, and usually makes 3 jumps.

>   You recognize a cannon's good alloy when you see it. If there is green color on the surface becomes red, it means they are made of a sufficient quantity of <span class="m">rosette</span>. Otherwise, the cannon's <span class="m">metal</span> will appear whitish. If you don't see it, just scratch it and you will see it. 
 
> *at left bottom margin*

> 
>   The good alloy for the cannon is three <span class="ms">pans</span> of <span class="m">rosette</span> and one of big bells' fine <span class="m">metal</span>, where there is more <span class="m">rosette</span> than in small bells' <span class="m">metal</span>. This <span class="m">metal</span> usually costs 15 <span class="cn">pounds</span> and fine <span class="m">rosette</span> 15 or 16.

> 
>   <span class="ms"><span class="pl">Montpellier</span> pan</span> is equivalent to six <span class="ms">King's inches</span>, which is equivalent to two ordinary.

>   To level a cannon properly, one needs to have the mouth as high as the breech. Otherwise, you do not aim well.
