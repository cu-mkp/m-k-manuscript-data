again quite hard, and then add to it three <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">minium</span>, & pound again together & put it in the <span class="tl">crucible</span>, which you will cover with an appropriate <span class="tl">tile</span>, not too thick, so that heat reverberates better. Then put it on the <span class="tl">grill</span> of your <span class="tl">furnace</span>, having put a few thick, rounded <span class="tl">tiles</span> under it. Next, fill your <span class="tl"><span class="m">charcoal</span> furnace</span> to the <span class="bp">mouth</span> with <span class="m">charcoal</span>, heaped to the top, and let it light, and always maintain the heat even, without letting the <span class="m">charcoal</span> go down. And to this effect, always ensure that the <span class="tl">furnace</span> is heaped to the top & full of <span class="m">charcoal</span> and maintain it like this for one <span class="ms">day</span>. The first experiment I made, only a yellow mass emerged, like <span class="m">minium</span> alone when vitrified, & with <span class="m">gold</span> grains, in a mass at the bottom. Try cemented <span class="m">gold</span> together with <span class="m">antimony</span>.

## <span class="m">Topaz</span>

 
The same dose can be observed for all <span class="m">gemstones</span>, which is one <span class="ms">part</span> the weight of calcined <span class="m">pebbles</span> with three <span class="ms">parts</span>the weight of <span class="m">minium</span>, pounding all separately in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> mortar</span> for <span class="m">emeralds</span>, & in an <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> mortar</span> to make <span class="m">topazes</span> or <span class="m">amber</span> color, with <span class="tl">pestles</span> similar to the <span class="tl">mortars</span>. <span class="m">Emerald</span> & <span class="m">topaz</span> are of the same heat, an <span class="ms">hour</span> & a half, otherwise they could burn. <span class="m">Ruby</span> wants more time & more fire, & colored with <span class="m">gold</span> leaf. I believe that <span class="m">pumice stone</span> or <span class="m">fire—stone</span> for the <span class="m">ruby</span> would be better. See <span class="m">enamels</span>. Also try to mix pieces of colored <span class="m">glass</span> or <span class="m">enamels</span> instead of <span class="m">pebbles</span>. If the mass is not colored enough, pound it further in the <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> mortar</span>.

>   Slightly burnt <span class="m">tartar</span> mixed in makes beautiful yellow, but not much is needed. <span class="m">Arene</span> also makes it more yellow.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Salt</span> for melting

 
Mix <span class="m">saltpeter</span> & <span class="m">common salt</span> and melt them together & throw them onto <span class="m">copper</span>, molten or in a bain, & it will purify it & makes it run marvellously. First, <span class="m">ordinary salt</span> needs to be decrepitated, which is to say holding it over good heat until it crackles no more; or to melt it better, in an <span class="tl">four à vent</span>. Throw it neatly onto a <span class="m">marble</span> <span class="sup">slab</span>, then pestle it & crush it very finely, then put it in a <span class="tl">crucible</span>on as much <span class="m">saltpeter</span>. Let it boil & mix them together until
