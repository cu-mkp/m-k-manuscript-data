Mortars are made of the best alloy of <span class="m">"métal"</span> and the finest possible <span class="m">rosette</span> so that they do not burst, that is to say one part <span class="m">"métal"</span> and two parts fine <span class="m">rosette</span> or old caudron, which is even better.

 narrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of powder they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of 4 s. lb. are eight lines thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 lines. They have xiii "poulsses" long and seven in diameter at the mouth and opening.
