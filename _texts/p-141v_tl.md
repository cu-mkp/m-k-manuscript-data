Let your <span class="al">crayfish</span> dry a little in the sun, by itself. If it has spawns, they will shrink while drying, and be all the more beautiful for it. Make your paste out of yellow <span class="m"><span class="pro">potter</span>'s earth</span>, just like for the other representations. Lay your <span class="al">crayfish</span> on it, the back side down, and the other parts which are more tricky to mold —— legs, belly, eggs — side up. Drive in the back side in the <span class="m">clay</span> paste up to the legs, which is about the half part <span class="sup">of the crayfish's body</span>. Fix the body with a pointy <span class="m">iron</span> thread in the middle and, if you feel you need it, you can also drive another one at the edge of the tail. And in order that the big legs be lower than the head, which is lower because it is linked from below, add a little <span class="m">clay</span> <span class="sup">under the head</span>. Then add a bit of <span class="m">clay</span> under the jacket in order to raise it. Hide the feelers under the <span class="m">clay</span> and under the crusher claws, then arrange it as you like. Stretch out the walking legs to the joints, and for the first cast, bend the second part of the walking legs. Fix the joints of the legs with <span class="m">wax</span> and a warm <span class="m">wire</span> so they will not move. If you want to mould something fancier, fix the end of one walking legs on the body or on a crusher claw , using the same <span class="m">wax</span>. If the female has spawns, bent half the tail over the spawns, and keep the shape by fixing the tail with a <span class="m">wire</span>. Be sure that you will be able to clean this part. Finally rub your <span class="al">crayfish</span> with <span class="m">spirits</span>, and cast your sand. Once the sand is hardened, uncover the back side, the head, the eyes, and the small legs close to the crusher claws, and the walking legs all along. One must uncover these parts as much as possible. Then bend and cover the spawns again. The other animals

> To paint the crayfish, one paints the middle of the back with <span class="m">vermilion</span><span class="m">,</span> mixed with a bit of <span class="m">lacquer</span>. The sides, the belly, and below the legs with a mixture made of <span class="m">vermilion</span>, <span class="m">ceruse</span>, and a bit of yellow <span class="m">ochre</span>. As with all things, always keep the real one in front of you in order to copy it <span class="sup">as realistically as possible</span>.
