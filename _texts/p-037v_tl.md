## <span class="pro">Gardener</span>

 
 To sow melons properly, it must be the end of a moon [cycle], because otherwise they would sprout too many leaves and not bear much fruit. Every two fingers, make small holes with a small pickaxe and, in each, put two or three seeds. Then, take very fine <span class="m">earth</span> and lightly fill the holes with it. Afterwards, spread the thickness of one thumb of 'havets,' that is wheat chaff, over everything, so that when the rain comes, it does not beat the earth and prevent their birth. 'Hanets' attract <span class="al">field mice</span> that eat the seeds, and to prevent this, they must be moistened with a decoction of <span class="m">wormwood</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Glass—maker</span>

 
 Some do not lay <span class="m">gris d'escaille</span> on the <span class="m">glass</span> to work on it, but trace straight on the <span class="m">glass</span> with <span class="m">noir à huile</span>. However, it is important that the <span class="m">wood</span> be <span class="m">degreased</span>, because if it has even a little <span class="m">grease</span> [on it], the color will not take at all. And even, if the working <span class="pro">glass—maker</span> has a stink from his nose or his mouth, and he breathes on the <span class="m">glass</span>, the color will not take on it. Those who came up with the invention of working in small works of softened <span class="m">enamels</span> use only <span class="m">azure enamel</span>, which is blue, and <span class="m">esmail colombin</span>, which is the color of purple, which they soften with <span class="m">rocks</span> or <span class="m">lead glass</span>. As for yellow, they make it from <span class="m">silver</span>, red from <span class="m">sanguine</span>, as is said elsewhere, black and gray and shadows from <span class="m">scale black</span>, either strong or weak, carnation from light <span class="m">sanguine</span>. Green is made first from yellow, then they overlay <span class="m">azure enamel</span>, either strong or weak, depending on whether they want to make it bright or dark. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Yellow Amber</span>

 
 It is cut with a <span class="tl">file</span>, then one passes a certain <span class="m">pulverized salt</span> across the surface, which an <span class="pl">Englishman</span> called desramonet. But I believe that this was <span class="m">pulverized pumice stone</span>, for it had the harshness of <span class="m">arène</span>. And with a taut <span class="tl">cord</span>, he polished his <span class="m">amber</span>, then passed <span class="m">tripoli from <span class="pl">Bretagne</span></span> on it with the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>; others used a piece of <span class="tl"><span class="m">leather</span></span> or a <span class="tl">cane</span>. <span class="m">Amber</span> loses its color if an unhealthy person wears it, & becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be soaked for one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">night</span></span> in <span class="m">urine</span>, then boiled a little in it.
