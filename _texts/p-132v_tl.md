dry by itself. When your mold starts to redden, it will soon be become completely red—hot. But make sure that its bottom is red—hot too, without any black spot.
 
 
  

##  Common quarry <span class="m">sand</span>

 
In a frame, If you cast it hot, <span class="m">sand</span> will bubble; thus you have to just dry it.

## <span class="m">Crocum ferry</span>

 
After I processed it with <span class="m">vinegar</span> and reddened under heat, I had it ground very finely on the <span class="m">porphyry</span>, until there could be no ruggedness felt under the nails. Then I soaked it in very good <span class="m">vinegar</span> for 2 or 3 days, stirring the mixture several times a day. Then I boiled it and made it red—hot in a pot, and put the whole thing into an air furnace. I obtained a mass full of eyes, but that crumbled finely between the fingers. I mixed half as much as <span class="m">stone alum</span> in the sand. I diluted the sand very thinly, and molded a very small lizard, which molded very cleanly and finely. <span class="m">Crocum ferry</span> does not make the mold harder, but makes it firmer. When your mold is soft and fat under your nail, it means that the <span class="m">crocum</span> is good, very fine and well prepared. You can add any quantity of <span class="m">crocum</span>, your mold will not be damaged because it is a friend of gold. I think it would be the same with <span class="m">silver</span>. And in order that molds made with it do not crack, make it with needle filings.

>   <span class="m">Sand</span> is better made with <span class="m">distilled vinegar</span>.
 
> *at left middle margin*
> 
> 
>   You can add this <span class="m">sand</span> to the molds you want to use to cast <span class="m">silver</span>, because it make molds firmer, and when you scratch it, you will find it a bit rougher than the other molds not made from this <span class="m">sand</span>. You mold very clean with this <span class="m">sand</span>.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   You can use this one for all molds, because it prevents them from cracking and bursting when heated. This <span class="m">sand</span> withstands several casts for molding flat medals. Sand from <span class="m">steel</span> or <span class="m">needle filings</span> is redder and better.
 
 
  

## Gilding animals casted with <span class="m">silver</span>

 
You can gild them with an amalgam, the lines won't be damaged if they are made from <span class="m">silver</span>.
