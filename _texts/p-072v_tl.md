## Casting

 
<span class="m">Lead</span>, which is mortified & weighty, wants to be cast hot, more so than <span class="m">tin</span>. And when it is not hot enough, it makes lines in the medal. <span class="del">It</span> <span class="m">Straw</span> burns in it, provided it is hot. One can make a <span class="m">solder</span> so soft & runny that it can be melted in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">tin</span> dish</span>. It is composed of one <span class="ms">part</span> <span class="m">looking glass tin</span>, one <span class="ms">part</span> <span class="m">soft tin</span>, & another <span class="ms">part</span> <span class="m">lead</span>. It runs very neatly and is cast in leaves, but the work is very brittle & prone to breaking. The best <span class="m">solder</span> is the common one for casting well, but <span class="del">is</span> leaves certain lumpy points. Alloy <span class="m">lead</span> with <span class="m">tin</span> so that the ingot that you will cast comes out even & shiny & polished, & without any eyes or bubbles except for a small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is enough <span class="m">tin</span>, otherwise the <span class="m">lead</span> dominates too much. Sand is good for <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span>. The good one is very thin & fine & lean, which however sticks together between one’s <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span>. The sand wants to be reheated before being put to work. And <span class="del">once</span> to mold <span class="add">with it</span>, it wants to be very moistened & then reheated, not all at once nor with a burst of fire, for this corrupts & makes it shrink & crumble as well. But if you reheat it gently, it renders itself very stiff, once well moistened. One ought to pass it through a <span class="tl">shirt <span class="add">sleeve</span></span> for the finest one, in order to first put some on the piece to mold.
 
One makes a <span class="m">solder</span> with <span class="m">quicksilver</span> <span class="del">but</span>which is white, but it is brittle. Make your <span class="tl">box mold</span> so that it joins well & that one does not see the daylight between the joints.
 
The <span class="pl">Germans</span> cast their <span class="m">leads</span> very thinly, rather than very thickly, because it seems they come out better, but so that are not too pliant, being so thin, they mix a little <span class="m">tin</span> with the said <span class="m">lead</span>, which otherwise would fold up like <span class="m">wax</span>.
 
The blackest <span class="m">lead</span>, so say some, is the best & the softest & which runs the best. <span class="sn">You will know its goodness by rubbing it with your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>, which will render it very black quickly</span>. 
 
The alloy good for running <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> is per one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">lead</span>, one <span class="ms">lb</span> & a half of <span class="m">tin</span> <span class="del">aultr</span>, so that the tin exceeds more than one <span class="ms">part</span>. It is <span class="m">solder</span> which flows well & that is good for casting, but it is brittle.

>   <span class="m"><span class="al">Cuttlefish</span> bone</span> molds <span class="m">lead</span> better than anything else. But try it to see if it needs reheating. <span class="del">One ought to mold on the back of the <span class="m">bones</span> & from this side for the <span class="m">marrow</span> is more delicate there.</span>
 
> *at left middle margin*

> 
>   The <span class="m">bone marrow</span> towards the tail is more delicate & does have not as many stripes & molds more cleanly. The <span class="m">shell</span> which holds the <span class="m">marrow</span>, once calcined, is good for making sand.

> 
>   When you cast <span class="m">lead</span>, one ought to cast it <span class="del">cast very neatly</span> <span class="add">rather</span> hot, & not at once & shake the <span class="tl">box mold</span> a little & cast two or three times. However, if it is cast too hot, it will rise up & swell. When it is very hot, it becomes blue, let it then pass this color <span class="del">deva</span> & rest a little before casting.

>   Some, such as <span class="pro">printers</span>, mix <span class="m">iron filings</span> or <span class="m">pins</span> in the <span class="m">lead</span>, <span class="del">but</span> in order to render it hard. But this renders it brittle &<span class="del">not</span> it breaks under the <span class="tl">hammer</span>.
