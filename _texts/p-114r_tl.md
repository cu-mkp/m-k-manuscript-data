## Second Casting

 
When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is to say the back, the spine, and the entire top part, and when the half—mold where the part is encased is hard enough

 turn over the bottom and the sides of the belly, sometimes using a knife for the thicker parts, and then with a pen—knife for the places where the more fragile parts are encased, like legs, tail, and similar things. Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it and do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the animal himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the <span class="al">lizard</span>'s throat more than you would do a <span class="al">snake</span>, because the <span class="al">lizard</span> has big jaws and big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the wet sand is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it and wipe each part again with a cloth made of <span class="al">swine</span> hair, slightly dampened into salt <span class="m">water</span> or clear <span class="m">water</span>, do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered animal will be very neat. # 🝋 Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into <span class="m">water</span> for a pater noster. It will suck water inside, that way when you'll rub with <span class="m">oil</span> the uncovered side, the <span class="m">oil</span> will remain on the top, and to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking. Dip your mold into <span class="m">water</span>, take a particularly fine brush and rub with <span class="m">oil</span> the entire mold but the animal; it should not be touched with <span class="m">oil</span>. Make sure to use you brush between the parts and on all the fragile parts. And if by mistake <span class="m">oil</span> is soaked, dip the mold into <span class="m">water</span>, as it is said above, and drop by drop the <span class="m">oil</span> will come back to the top.

 remove all the little tacks with the help of very small flat pincers.

It is at the level of the head that you must make the biggest notch and you should start at that notch to expose and then keep following by looking at the traces left by the tacks. 
 
# and if a small piece of nail, or piece of tail, or other fine things separate from the mold, put a little piece of <span class="m">wax</span>between them, and join them with the tip of a hot <span class="m">iron</span> wire, then smooth it in your mold with a knife, and make notches on the sides in order for the other half of the mold to adhere to it. 🝋
