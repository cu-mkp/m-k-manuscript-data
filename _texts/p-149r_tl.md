## Softening <span class="m">iron</span> and making it really soft

 
Take some <span class="m">sublimate</span>, some <span class="m">quicklime</span>, <span class="m">soap from Venice</span>, some <span class="m">horse manure</span>, use less <span class="m">sublimate</span> than the other ingredients. Moisten all of them together, forming a paste and apply this to the <span class="m">iron</span>, and wrap the whole thing in a dirty rag. Then reheat it until it becomes very red. Or leave it overnight in a good fire until the morning. It will be very soft and you will be able to engrave whatever you wish on it.

 
  

## Gold of lesser quality from <span class="pl">Germany</span>, <span class="m">Electre</span>

 
One calls it <span class="m">gold</span> from the <span class="pl">Rhine</span>, which you can find in the rivers, and it comes in gold flakes. <span class="pl">German</span> <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> wanted to refine it, thinking that they could separate it from the whitenes, which they thought was <span class="m">silver</span>. But it always stayed white, which proves that this whiteness is fixed and it's only fault lies in its color. This is <span class="m">electre</span>, from which you can make cups, which will reveal poison.

 
  

## Various arts from <span class="pl">Germany</span>

 
They make great use of water mills, and most of these artisans working with <span class="m">gold</span>, <span class="m">silver</span>, and any other metal, bring their large works to the mills to be hammered. And to pull <span class="m">iron thread</span>, they heat large amounts of <span class="m">iron</span>, making it into a point, they hang it up still red, and very quickly pull it.

 
  

## Reparing medals

 
If you want to mold any medal to use as a model, and at the same time repair it, cast it in a greater quantity of <span class="m">tin</span>, and put in it a good amount of <span class="m">tin alloy</span> to make it harder.
