some thread, as much to secure the herbs so that they do not rise when you throw in your <span class="m">clear sand</span>, as to give them some circulation when they are reheated. Because by doing this the thread burns away and leaves some empty space around the herbs which acts as vents, and places for the air to escape, and places for the air to enter so that they burn more easily; because what keeps them carbonized, is when they burn in a closed fire with no empty spaces because of the fine sprigs. Therefore try to enlarge the main stem with a bit <span class="m">melted wax</span> and leave it to cool. Then mold it. And when the <span class="m">wax</span> melts, it will leave the main stem sitting comfortably and almost loosely so that it burns better. Or you could apply some <span class="m">petrol oil</span>, <span class="m">sulphur</span>, <span class="m">turpentine</span>, <span class="m">brick oil</span>, or similar things, or with <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> or <span class="m">spirits</span>, or make you <span class="m">sand</span> with . Or make your <span class="m">sand</span> with <span class="m">crocum filings</span> of <span class="m">iron lumps</span> or <span class="m">iron esmeri</span> which allow for several days of high fire.
 
Animal bones are not as difficult to burn and reduce to cinders, because their flesh being burned, the bones remain loose and the heaviness of <span class="m">quicksilver</span> makes them break and be crushed, being calcinated and burnt.

## <span class="m">Plaster</span> mold for <span class="m">wax</span>

 
When your <span class="m">plaster</span> mold is done and dried, be sure that your mold comes off cleanly because it sometimes happens that the animal, having been wounded or having lost weight or having withered, has wrinkles where <span class="m">plaster</span> can get in the scales. Having not been rendered well, the animal will attack itself and break and will never be perfect. Be also advised to make your casts for <span class="m">wax</span> very big. In this way, your casts will not be too thick. They are done when the mold of both sides is done and when the animal
