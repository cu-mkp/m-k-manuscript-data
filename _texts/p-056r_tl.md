## Excellent temper for breastplates

 
 Have the clearest and the most running <span class="m">river water</span> you can, and heat it up slightly more than warm. Then have a bunch of <span class="m">reseda,</span> take its seeds and dip them into the said <span class="m">water</span> and bring it to a rolling boil it while stirring it with a <span class="m">stick</span>. Then pour it into a muid or any other vessel, then throw into it two pecks of <span class="m">salt</span>. 
 
Then take a big cauldron full of the said <span class="m">river water</span> and heat it up slightly more than warm. Take three or four times the quantity of <span class="m">red greasy earth</span> you can hold in two cupped hands, dip it and throw it into the cauldron filled with the said <span class="m">water</span>. Have as much <span class="m">pigeon manure</span> as of the said <span class="m">earth</span>, as much <span class="m">horse manure</span> and as much <span class="m">iron scrapings</span>. And mix each of these separately, throw into the caldron and leave for two or three days. Then throw it into the said muid and stir all strongly altogether. And the older this temper is, the better it will work.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span> for <span class="m">distemper</span>

 
You can make <span class="m">marble</span> by <span class="m">distemper</span> from <span class="m">lake</span> or <span class="m">rose of <span class="pl">Ghent</span></span> & <span class="m">chalk</span>. Once dry, glaze with <span class="m">lake</span> mixed in <span class="m">wine</span>, for the <span class="m">glue</span> makes it die & blacken. And all will then appear red, but the <span class="m">varnish</span> you will put here, which will penetrate, will make dark & light parts appear as they ought to be. The <span class="m">varnish</span> is made thus, mix with <span class="m">clear <span class="pl">Venice</span> turpentine</span> some <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> <span class="del">&</span> until all is clear & liquid enough, &it is done without fire. This one <span class="del">es</span> is for things in <span class="m">distemper</span>, and the <span class="m">turpentine varnish</span> that you know, for panels. <span class="m">Pure <span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil varnish</span> is not good for panels, for <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> is too penetrating & makes colours sparkle, unless it was made long ago.
