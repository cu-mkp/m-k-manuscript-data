 passing through so well. But for this effect, choose <span class="m">raw silk</span> yellow and natural because it is stronger and rejects <span class="m">flour</span> as <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span>hair</span> does.

 
  

## To know the good <span class="m">azurite ash</span> for <span class="m">oil</span>

 
The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is also very pale in color, because <span class="m">oil</span> darkens it. Certain <span class="pro">sophisticators</span> mix them, but you will know this if you pour some onto a piece of <span class="m">paper</span> & lay it flat & smudge it with the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> since, if it is mixed, it will be found variegated & as if with pale & darker stripes, but if it is unmixed it will be even & of one color. 
 
 
  

## Whitening of <span class="m">pearls</span>

 
When they have been applied in embroidery on some garment, they are greasy & are cleaned in <span class="m">soapy water</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Toadstone</span>

 
That which is from the head of the <span class="al">toad</span> and has the shape of the <span class="al">toad</span>, painted naturally as you have seen, is the most excellent. It is held that if one puts the powder made from it on a <span class="tl">brazier</span> in someone's chamber at night, they will be unable to move, speak, or stop <span class="pro">thieves</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Snakes</span>

 
It is said that if one calls a <span class="al">snake</span> in Greek, saying ΟΦΗ ΟΦΗ, it will flee. Likewise, if one <span class="del">nom</span> calls a <span class="al">swine</span> in Greek, <span class="del">y</span> ïon, it will come. 
 
 
  

## Candles

 
<span class="pro">Candlemakers</span> never make good candles when the <span class="env">autan wind</span> blows because they always melt, however good is the <span class="m">tallow</span> they use.
