## Removing <span class="m">gold</span>

 
<span class="m">Gold</span> as gilding goes away if the coin is reheated and placed against a strong fire, even if there is <span class="m">lead</span>, because <span class="m">lead</span>, which contains much <span class="m">mercury</span> will pierce a <span class="m">gold</span> coin in a fire.
 
 
  

## Cutting <span class="m">lead</span>

 
Because it [<span class="m">lead</span>] is fat, hard to catch and corrosive to the knife and the scissors, wet it up and you will [be able to] cut it like <span class="m">glass</span>.

>   Sometimes, <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>, exposed to a certain kind of smoke, take on a coloration during the casting. But these are neither flakes nor coat but a colour which will go away during the whitening.
 
 
  

## Softening <span class="m">silver</span>

 
When <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> who work on a large scale have forged their plates, to their loss [these plates] quite often break and crack because they have been sharpened too much. In order to avoid this, when it is quite melted, throw in ground dry <span class="m">mortar</span> made of <span class="m">sand</span> and good <span class="m">lime</span> which has been used before.

>   <span class="pro">Goldsmiths</span> do not work with <span class="m">silver</span> from <span class="m">real</span> because it is rich in <span class="m">lead</span> and becomes sour when forged.
 
For small works and things that need to go only once to the fire, some weld with some old <span class="m">sol</span> or <span class="m">carolus</span> reheated and beaten. However if the <span class="m">sol</span> is not quite good [enough], the welding will not hold as there is too much <span class="m">copper</span> and one will have to weld twice. Others weld with [an alloy made of] half <span class="m">silver</span> and half fine <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Iron</span> flakes

 
Once it is quite ground and refined on the <span class="m">marble</span> slab and mixed with the <span class="m">sand</span> from the core [mold], dry it slowing without reheating it, and it will allow for several casting of <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>. <span class="m">Copper</span> and <span class="m">brass</span> come out fine of it. But if it is not ground as finely as <span class="m">crocum</span>, it sinks unless the <span class="m">sand</span> is soaked and quite thick.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Metal file dust</span>

 
It does not melt by itself if it is not helped with some portion of similar <span class="m">metal</span> melted to assemble it and bathe it, as it is more burnt than melted. <span class="m">File dust</span> from <span class="m">tin</span> and <span class="m">lead</span> are made with <span class="m">tallow</span>, [<span class="m">file dust</span>] from <span class="m">gold</span> with <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, [<span class="m">file dust</span>] from <span class="m">silver</span> with <span class="m">sandever.</span>
