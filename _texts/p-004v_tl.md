## <span class="m">Black varnish</span> for sword guard, bands for trunks, &c.

 
Take <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span> or more cheaply, <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span>, and rid it of fattiness with <span class="m"><span class="pa">garlic</span></span> & <span class="del"><span class="m"><span class="pa">onions</span></span></span> <span class="add">\+<span class="m"><span class="pa">hog's fennel</span></span> some also add <span class="m">bread crusts</span></span>, which you will boil in it for <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">a good quarter of an hour</span></span>. Then add to one <span class="ms">lb</span> of the <span class="m">oil</span> thus boiled a piece of <span class="m">black pitch</span> <span class="ms">the size of a <span class="pa">walnut</span></span> & a <span class="ms">double handful</span> of <span class="m"><span class="pa">wheat grain</span></span>, without removing the <span class="m"><span class="pa">garlic</span></span> & <span class="m"><span class="pa">onions</span></span> and let it boil together for <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">a good quarter of an hour</span></span>. And when the <span class="m">pitch</span> is well melted & the <span class="m">oil</span> has body, you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your <span class="m">iron</span> over a low <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire & apply your <span class="m">varnish</span> with a <span class="tl">feather</span> or a <span class="tl">brosse</span>. And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your <span class="m">varnish</span> is dry.

>   If there is a lot of <span class="m">varnish</span>, it needs to boil for at least <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">half a day</span></span>, for it is better the more it boils. It is dangerous if the fire catches within, if it goes over the top, and is hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a <span class="env">courtyard</span> or an <span class="env">open space</span>.

>   In five or six <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">oil</span>, one must put one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">galipot</span>, which costs 4 <span class="cn">sols</span>, & some <span class="m">peeled <span class="pa">garlic</span> cloves</span>. This <span class="m">varnish</span> itself is not black, but blackens over the fire.

## <span class="m">Black varnish</span> without fire, without disassembling the harnesses or removing the bands from trunks

 
Take <span class="m">varnish of <span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> & mix it with <span class="m">soot black</span> or <span class="m">lampblack</span>, & without fire it will mix in by itself. Varnish with a <span class="tl">brosse</span> & it will soon be dry. <span class="m">Turpentine varnish</span> will be quite good, but it does not dry as soon.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish of<span class="pro">iron engravers</span></span>

 
Take <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> &, in place of <span class="m">black pitch</span>, you will put in a little <span class="m">resin</span>, & it needs to be cooked in the manner of <span class="m">black varnish</span> on fire. And for applying it, heat your <span class="m">iron</span> & give it only one layer of <span class="m">varnish</span>, & when it no longer smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">steel</span> point</span> whatever you want. Next <span class="add">take</span> <span class="m">salt</span> & <span class="m">verdigris</span> & soak as much of one as of the other in <span class="m">quite strong vinegar</span> & leave it for XX4 <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span> before using it, & all will be soaked. Next spread some of this liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a <span class="tl">sponge</span>
