## <span class="del">Black</span>Painting of armory

 
<span class="m">Charcoal black</span> mixed with a little <span class="m">lead white</span> is very appropriate to make armory, mixing in a little <span class="del">of <span class="ill"></span></span> <span class="m">azure</span> if you wish. <span class="m">Charcoal <span class="add">black</span></span> by itself is as if bluish.
 
 
  

## Painting of <span class="m">crêpe</span>

 
First one needs to make the background greyish with <span class="m">charcoal black</span> mixed with <span class="m">lead white</span> & a little <span class="m">azure</span>. Then, <span class="del">resu</span> after it is dry, highlight with strokes & lines in <span class="m">lead white</span>.
 
 
  

## Folds in clothing

 
One needs to take care that none are made which are false, but that only that which happens naturally is imitated. A <span class="m">thick cloth</span> hardly makes any folds, <span class="m">taffetas</span> & <span class="m">silk cloth</span> make more, & <span class="m">crêpe</span> more still. <span class="del">Make</span> Observe which ones should go lengthwise & others across.
 
 
  

## Desiccative

 
<span class="m">Lead white</span> & <span class="m">massicot</span> are the most desiccative, nevertheless they need a good two <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>. If you want to prove whether an <span class="m">oil</span> is desiccative, temper <span class="m">lead white</span> with it, & if it produces a crust <span class="del">in a <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">day</span></span></span> soon it means that it will dessicate.
 
 
  

## Double layers

 
<span class="m">Azures</span>, flesh tones and reds are layered twice. The others not.
 
 
  

## Mending cracks in a panel

 
If a painted panel breaks you can <span class="m">glue</span> it well on the reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it & repair it, it ought not to be with <span class="m">glue </span>, which rots <span class="env">in damp weather</span> & would swell when touched with the <span class="m">oil</span> of the painting. But take <span class="m">white wax</span>, which is harder than the other kind. The <span class="m">oil</span> mixed in among the <span class="m">wax</span> prevents it from melting <span class="env">in the sun</span>. The <span class="m">wax</span> ought not to be hard, but soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks & crevices with the <span class="tl">tip of a knife</span>, then scrape.
