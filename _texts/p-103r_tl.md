## Against burns, excellent

 
Heat <span class="m">linseed oil</span> on a light fire, without letting it boil and simmer, but once it is hot put in a quarter as much of the newest <span class="m">wax</span> you can. After all this has melted, let it cool. And once it begins to curdle, stir continuously with a new wooden spatula for as long as it takes you to say 9 pater nosters, and while you say them, wash this composition with <span class="m">holy water</span>, stirring all the while. Having said the first 9 pater nosters, pour out the first <span class="m">water</span> and put in new one, and wash and stir the composition for the time it takes you to say 8 pater nosters, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, and thus successively you will add new <span class="m">water</span>, doing the same as above, until the last and single pater noster of nine.Then you shall have a soft white ointment, with which you shall besmear the burn for 9 days. But do not apply it any longer, since it would cause an overgrowth of flesh. You shall dress your burn twice a day, and each time you shall wash your face with water and wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing but so to say pressing with wet <span class="m">linen</span>, and you shall wipe it similarly with fine <span class="m">linen</span>. And then apply the ointment, over which you can put <span class="m">ivy leaves</span>. This causes hair to regrow and leaves no scar. I was taught this by a <span class="pro">powder maker</span> who had almost completely burnt himself but showed no sign of the burn.
 
 
  

## Against dog's gall.

 
The English, who cherish their dogs for taking care of their livestock, have grooms for them, who hold this particular office. And melting <span class="m">pitch</span> in water and leaving it to soak, they rub the dogs with that water, or with water sublimate.
