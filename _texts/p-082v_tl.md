## <span class="pro">Watchmakers</span>

 
Formerly, they dipping their springs by immersing them into <span class="m">molten lead</span>. Today they dip their straight springs, & afterwards bend them, which is a beautiful secret.
 
 
  

## Casting <span class="m">lead</span> in <span class="m">lead</span>

 
There are some who make their cavities with thick <span class="m">lead</span>, then cast <span class="m">lead</span> in them.<br/> <span class="m">Lead</span> when not cast hot enough, is white, & blacker when cast well hot.

## Sand

 
If it is too fat, one ought to reheat it and sieve it again.
 
 
  

## Ways of casting in <span class="m">bronze</span>

 
<span class="m">Latten of potin</span> <span class="del">cor</span>, which is the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many people, than <span class="m">fine latten of skillets</span>, just like all <span class="m">fine latten</span> molds neater than <span class="m">red copper</span>. If you want to cast something fine & thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it smokes a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat well, place your <span class="tl">crucible</span> as low as possible & at the very bottom of the <span class="tl">forge</span>, so that the <span class="tl">bellows</span> <span class="del">fra</span> beat on the middle of the <span class="tl">crucible</span>, for in this way it is better than on the <span class="tl">grill</span> on which one usually puts the <span class="tl">crucible</span>, under which the <span class="tl">bellows</span> beat. It is true that the <span class="tl">crucible</span> risks more danger breaking, but you can <span class="m">lute</span> it as you know <span class="pro">founders</span> do. And also, one ought to maintain the <span class="m">charcoal</span> between the <span class="tl">bellows</span> & the <span class="tl">crucible</span>. Also take heed to cast all at once & not in increments & drop by drop, which would stop & plug up the conduit of the substance. And if make in the cast an abreveoir to abreuver the medal, it would be even better. And so that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">wood</span> stick</span>, for <span class="m">iron</span> only makes it brittle. Turn.

>   Some put <span class="m">wool stuffing</span> in order to heat it & make it run.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   Put under your <span class="tl">crucible</span>, one large <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> platte</span>, which will redden & will maintain the heat under your <span class="tl">crucible</span>.

>   The <span class="m">copper</span> substance is found to be good for casting, when once broken it makes the grain long & not short, for it demonstrates that it is soft. It is <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">fine latten</span> & <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">red copper</span>. This long grain is called long stalk.
