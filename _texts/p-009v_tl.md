## <span class="pro">Painters</span>

 
They completely melt <span class="m">orpiment</span> in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> bottle</span> on very hot ashes, but it would be more appropriate to sublimate <span class="m">orpiment</span> in a long—necked <span class="tl">matrass</span> as for making <span class="m">garnets</span>. The <span class="m">orpiment</span> thus turns red like <span class="m">red enamel</span> & one needs to grind it damp because once completely melted it is very lively & difficult to grind. Next, you can <span class="del">br</span> thin it, once dry, with <span class="m">oil</span> & it will make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent <span class="m">orpiment</span> from dying with the other colors & to make it compatible with these & to make it dry promptly, it is a most rare secret to calcine <span class="m">common salt</span> & to grind it within. <span class="m">Green verditer</span> is not used with <span class="m">oil</span>.
