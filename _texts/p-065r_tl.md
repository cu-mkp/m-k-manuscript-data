## Shadows

 
 Because blacks make in different colors, some a reddish black, others tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which tend towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in <span class="m">oil</span>, for shadow, especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very strongly ground <span class="m">jet</span>, which you will mix with a little <span class="m"><span class="add">yellow</span> ochre</span> & <span class="m">lead white</span>. Or else, after you have ground your <span class="m">lead white</span> <span class="del">bro</span> and <span class="del">clean p</span> gathered it with the

, grind the <span class="m">jet</span> into it. Thus it will be more desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some black of , a little <span class="m">sap—green</span> & <span class="m">bistre</span>, & you will have a perfect shadow for women in <span class="m">distemper</span>.

## Flesh color

 
You must know well the mixing of colors & the appropriate shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note & observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise, as if going from <span class="del">l<span class="exp">ett</span>re a ga</span> right to left like

 , and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Mirror</span>

 
When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a <span class="tl"><span class="m">cristallin</span> <span class="tl">mirror</span></span>, which represents well after nature, and in which <span class="del">it</span> you will see if your shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a <span class="tl">candle</span>, for <span class="env">firelight</span> will make the shadows reddish. The <span class="pro">painter</span> also teacher himself with the <span class="tl">mirror</span>, for he sees in it what the natural can do.
 
 
  

## Greasy colors

 
If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered colors have penetrated, it means that this part is greasy, & that the second colors one layers on would not take on the dry <span class="sup">layer</span>, unless you rub this part with <span class="m">soap</span> or breathe on it, because the humidity will make the colors take.

>   One cannot layer <span class="m">oil</span> on cut <span class="m">paper</span> & model as in <span class="m">distemper</span> because the colour would run. Thus, to <span class="m">gild</span> with <span class="m">or mat</span>, one needs to pounce & then layer the <span class="m">gold color</span> with the <span class="tl">pinceau</span>.

>   All greasy colors, such as <span class="m">ceruse</span> and <span class="m">minium</span>, <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">ochre</span>, <span class="m">lead white</span> are good for making gold color.

>   Any color or thing that thickens when <span class="m">water</span> is put with it when it is being ground has body. But those that lack it, such as <span class="m">cristallin</span>, <span class="m">lake</span> & become clear.
