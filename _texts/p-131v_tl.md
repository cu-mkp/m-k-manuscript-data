to be cast with <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>. Do not add to your wax all the drugs you are preparing, but only melted <span class="m">sulphur</span>, as the candle melts, and also <span class="m">candle smoke</span>. Melted <span class="m">sulphur</span> falls down to the bottom of your mold, but lets the <span class="m">wax</span> keeps some of its quality, melting it but leaving it a little firm. You can thus melt your <span class="m">wax</span> representation on fire. If your wax is composed of <span class="m">cerussite</span> or something similar, you need to put your mold into boiling water.

## When <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> casts fill with bubbles

 
 If your casted work became porous, it can be repaired with very firm wax, and you can gild or silver it afterwards. If you cast fine, the alloy of one ℥ of <span class="m">lead</span> to one lb of tin is good. But if you cast with <span class="m">lead</span><span class="add"><span class="del">[ligue illegible]</span></span>, indeed you need one lb of <span class="m">lead</span> to two ℥ of tin, because lead is fat and sticky, goes over the alloy. I have cast a very small lizard that way. If you cast something thick, which keep the heat for a long time, it will make bubble if there is not enough <span class="m">tin</span>. Your mold should not be cold, but cool enough that you can hold it without burning your hand, or that you can hold your finger into the cast without burning yourself. Your <span class="m">tin</span> or <span class="m">lead</span> must be like red. Cast your lead first, then cast tin. When you are going to cast, add a piece of <span class="m">resin</span> to your mixture, then a little <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span>. If you add too much <span class="m">lead</span> to your <span class="m">tin</span>, the mixture wouldn't be fluid enough. To know [the right proportion], If <span class="m">tin</span> cries loudly, it means that there is not too much <span class="m">lead</span>; if <span class="m">tin</span> cries softly, it means that you added too much <span class="m">lead</span>. Be wary

>   <span class="m">Lead</span> must not be only red, it must be quick, and as liquid as water, which is a sign of its perfect heat. Your mold must be so hot that you couldn't bear to put your finger into it. Do not open your mold until is has cooled down. Just as for <span class="m">silver</span> and <span class="m">gold</span>, it is a sign of good casting when <span class="m">lead</span> comes out through the vent holes.
