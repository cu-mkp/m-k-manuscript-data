which is usually of 3 <span class="ms">pan</span>s high. But first of all, you have to reheat your <span class="tl">furnace</span> with some big <span class="m">charcoal</span>, so the bottom is red hot and then you will put the said <span class="m">charcoal</span> measure in the middle of which you will put your <span class="m">iron</span>, not at once but ten or fifteen <span class="ms">pound</span>s each time. And since it will be swallowed at the <span class="tl">furnace</span> bottom, keep putting some more. And add three or four <span class="ms">shovel</span>s of bigger <span class="m">charcoal</span> and avoid it from getting consumed too quickly by wetting it. And when you will see your <span class="tl">furnace</span> full of two <span class="ms">quintal</span>s of matter, or less if you don't have that much, you will leave the <span class="m">charcoal</span> consume itself. And when the <span class="m">charcoal</span> is almost dying at the <span class="tl">furnace</span>'s level, you will be able to pour in the moulds and <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">metal</span> shells, which is even better for one <span class="m">metal</span> will bite the other. And the inside of the mold has to be covered with soaked <span class="m">ashes</span>, so it doesn't adhere to it.
 
 
  

## Against Gonorrhea

 
Soak some <span class="m"><span class="pa">quince</span> seeds</span> in some clear <span class="m">water</span> and inject this viscous <span class="m">water</span>
 
 
  

## To take fine forehead hair off

 
Have a loose <span class="m">silk</span> <span class="tl">needle</span> and put it tight through hair bulbs and they will bite the <span class="m">silk</span> like fine <span class="m">cotton</span> wisps.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Silk</span>

 
<span class="m">Crimson silk</span> is more frequent than all the other ones because its colour is not as expensive as blue or green ones which are, also, good bargain for the <span class="pro">worker</span>. <span class="m">Black silk</span> is less frequent because it costs a lot.
 
 
  

## How to keep <span class="m">oranges</span>

 
You have to choose them whole and not rotten and then fill a firmly closed <span class="tl"><span class="m">tin</span> vessel</span> with them and they will be fine for six months
 
 
  

## Candles

 
They can be kept in some <span class="m">bran</span> which make them white and last more, according to some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep them in a cool and dry place, so they are not pressed. It is better if there is a <span class="m">hemp</span> thread inside the wick of the candle to give more light and maintain wick straighter. If it is otherwise all <span class="m">cotton</span> made, as those of <span class="pl">Montauban</span> do, it needs to be snuffed out often because if it has been burning for a while, <span class="m">cotton</span> falls down and make the candle drip.
