## Applying the color of <span class="m"><span class="pl">Damascene</span> steel</span> on <span class="tl">knives</span>

 
Rub the <span class="m">steel</span> with <span class="m">common aquis fortis</span> mixed with <span class="m">earth</span>. After, rub everything with <span class="m">ashes</span> or <span class="m">sand</span>. Do with the <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span> as you would do on a <span class="tl">touchstone</span>.

 
  

## Getting rid of red <span class="bp">eyes</span> or black <span class="bp">eyes</span>

 
Make two small licks of <span class="m">raw <span class="al">mutton</span> flesh</span>, and with a blindfold, apply it at night on your <span class="bp">eyes</span>.

 
  

## For coating with <span class="m">or mat</span>

 
There is nothing better than the black varnish of <span class="pro">sword—makers</span> to make a ground layer because it dries immediately & makes the <span class="m">gold</span> appear very beautiful.
 
 
  

## Making <span class="tl"><span class="m">diamond</span> points</span> for engraving

 
These are for sketching what you want to draw on <span class="m">stones</span> and for engraving. When these <span class="tl">points</span> are too dull and cannot engrave, it is necessary to rub <span class="m">diamond</span> against <span class="m">diamond</span>; one can rub them with <span class="m"><span class="tl">pumice stone</span> powder</span>. It is necessary to strip what you want to engrave on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">lead</span> wheel</span> or with a <span class="m"><span class="tl">stone</span></span> or with <span class="m"><span class="tl">glass</span></span>, because the polishing is like varnish or <span class="m">glass</span> and stops the <span class="m">diamond</span> or <span class="m">sapphire</span> from engraving well. This is why it does not engrave easily on <span class="m">horn</span>, which is polished and fat. But when the polish has been taken off, it is easy to engrave.

 
  

## Polishing a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> wheel</span>

 
Instead of polishing your <span class="m">stone</span>, it is necessary to remove the grease by rubbing the flesh side of a piece of <span class="m">leather</span> <span class="sup">on the <span class="tl">wheel</span></span>, all while spinning the <span class="tl">wheel</span> if you have not worked on it in a long time.
