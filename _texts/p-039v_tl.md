## <span class="m">Enamel</span>

 
<span class="m">Enamel</span> takes more readily on <span class="m">copper</span> than on <span class="m">silver</span>. It is true that the cut needs to be well hollowed out & rough. <span class="m">Azure</span> in body & the red called gules, white <span class="m">enamel</span> & thick green take to it very well. Having <span class="m">enamelled</span>, one gilds the feuillages of the engraving<span class="del"></span>. <span class="m">Copper</span> has a similar hardness for engraving as fine <span class="m">silver</span> or <span class="m"><span class="cn">pistolet</span> <span class="m">gold</span></span>.
 
 
  

## Colors for illumination on <span class="m">glass</span>

 
In order that your <span class="m">turpentine</span> colors shall not spread, & hold together, mix in a little of <span class="m">tear of mastic</span> together with the <span class="m">turpentine</span>.
 
 
  

## Tracing some history on <span class="m">glass</span>

 
If you want to trace some history in intaglio on <span class="m">glass</span>, you can do it in different ways. Lay your <span class="m">glass pane</span> <span class="del">on</span>, the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, & having cleaned the <span class="m">glass</span> well with <span class="m">lye</span> & <span class="m">ash</span> so that it is not greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with <span class="m">noir à huile</span> or <span class="m">noir d’escaille</span> with the <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, if you want to paint with colors in the manner of <span class="pro">glaziers</span>, who wash their <span class="m">glass pane</span> with <span class="m">noir d’escaille</span> & then scrape & clear the parts which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for shading. But if you want to make <span class="m">gilt</span> histories on <span class="m">glass</span> with a background of colors, which imitates the basse—taille of <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span>, <span class="m">gild</span> your entire <span class="m">glass pane</span> with <span class="m">gum water</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pa">garlic</span> juice</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pa">fig—tree</span> milk</span>. Then moisten your printed history between two wet <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pl">linen</span> cloths</span></span> & lay it down on the <span class="m">gilt glass</span>. Then with a <span class="tl">pin</span> mounted on the end of a small <span class="tl">stick</span>, follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to pounce it, & thus you shall exactly trace it on the <span class="m">gilding of the glass</span>. & next you shall clear the background & that which needs to be blank with a quite pointy <span class="tl"><span class="m">steel</span> awl</span>, & and neatly follow once more the lines & accomplish your work & fashion your faces & flesh tones in pounded <span class="m">silver</span>; then you shall fill the background with <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span> or <span class="m">verdigris</span> or <span class="m">fine laque platte</span> <span class="del">platte</span> tempered with <span class="m">clear turpentine</span>, mixed with a little of <span class="m">tear of mastic</span> if you want that the colors hold together more & not to spread. Next, layer on the back of the <span class="m">glass</span> & over the colors a <span class="m">white tin</span> sheet. And once this is dry, you can cover the <span class="m">tin</span> sheet <span class="del">of</span> with color to hide your secret. The <span class="m">tin</span> sheet gives light to the colors. Thus you will be able to paint without being
