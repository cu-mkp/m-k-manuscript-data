 Culverines are big batteries of forty <span class="ms">quintal</span>s and eighteen <span class="ms">pan</span>s long. Their bullet of the <span class="ms">King's standard</span> and battery weighs 30 <span class="ms">pound</span>s and is therefore lighter than the canon's one. Therefore, It does not carry so many munitions because fifteen <span class="ms">pound</span>s are enough for its load. The canon has a bigger mouth due to the size of its cannonball, but the colverine is more precise and goes faster, having greater range due to its length. Its breech is two bullets and a third thick, the front is a bullet thick. Culverines are used for fighting fortifications from far away when it is not possible to easily approach them. And then canons come closer. They are used also to support the battery. Fifteen or sixteen <span class="al">horse</span>s are necessary to carry it. They are made of the same metal alloy than the canon, like all others smaller pieces <span class="sup">of artillery</span>. For these, we add a little bit more metal in order to make the melting run better. And for two <span class="ms">quintal</span>s of <span class="m">rosette</span>, you add six unit of metal per pound for smaller pieces. They range from 8 or 9 hundred <span class="ms">pace</span>s to a thousand <span class="ms">pace</span>s if the <span class="m">powder</span> is strong and in the air half a <span class="ms">league</span>.

But this is not sure for big pieces for they are loaded with a lot of <span class="m">powder</span>.
 
 The bastarde is a middle—sized piece <span class="sup">of artillery</span> which weighs thirty <span class="ms">quintal</span>s and its cannonballs weight 15 <span class="ms">pound</span>s and is loaded with 10 or 12 <span class="ms">pound</span>s of <span class="m">powder</span>. Its proportions are two cannonballs and a third part of a third one thick at the breech and one cannonballs and three parts of two at the front. They are used for fighting against less important defences such as gabions or sentries, topped with a tower, or similar thing. It is thirteen to fourteen <span class="ms">pan</span>s long like the great cannon. Ten <span class="al">horse</span>s are necessary to carry it. It goes with the culverine for shooting because it carries small munitions.

 The bastarde culverine weights 35 <span class="ms">quintal</span>s and is 25 <span class="ms">pan</span>s long. The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front two cannonballs. Its cannonball is like the bastard one, weighing 15 <span class="ms">pound</span>s. These are fixed pieces which cannot be carried on a carriage. They are for city defences. Some make cannons like these which are 27 or 28 <span class="ms">pan</span>s long, like <span class="pl">La Rochelle</span>'s vache, but such pieces are strengthened at the breech with a width of three cannonballs. Their range is one <span class="ms">league</span> and a half. Its load is like the bastarde's one, and if one wants to hit <span class="pro">horsemen</span> very far way, more <span class="m">powder</span> is added. After the cannonball there is a trace of smoke which drives your trajectory to where the cannonball is going. This is understood for cannons and the culverine, but not for small pieces.
