## Grey hilts

 
When they are white, it is necessary only to clean them well, and then to heat them over a fire, and make them turn blue. And take good care that they do not turn too blue, since neither <span class="m">gold</span> nor <span class="m">silver</span> nor any color would set. To accomplish this, which is called les faire passer, have a caldron full of <span class="m">ashes</span> that you cover with some <span class="m">blazing hot charcoal</span>, and heat the <span class="m">ashes</span> thus very well, for an hour or two. And when the <span class="m">ashes</span> are very hot, put the <span class="m">charcoal</span> aside and put the hilt where the <span class="m">charcoal</span> was, and cover it completely with <span class="m">ashes</span>. And when the body, which is the main part of the hilt, is completely colored, flip it onto the other side. In that way, the grey cannot color it too dark, unless some <span class="m">hot coal</span> touches it. Greying can be achieved in an ordinary fireplace, too, but there is a danger that it may sit there too long and make a crust which which will prevent the color from setting. Blue coloring is obtained as soon as the <span class="m">ashes</span> have heated the hilts a little bit, but it will always be grey on some sides. After blue comes grey.
 
 
  

## Color of water

 
For the color of water, pass a <span class="tl">lime doulce</span> on the guards to whiten them, then the <span class="tl">burnisher</span>. Next, one makes them pass blue until they become grey. Next, when they are still moderately hot, pass the <span class="m">bloodstone</span> over them, and when they cool, one turns them to reheat them, for the color of water is made only by several goes. And if the guards were not warm, the <span class="m">bloodstone</span> would scrape & undo the color. One needs to heed that guards do not pass too grey, for they would give off filth that would prevent the color from taking. One needs almost one day for preparing, softening, and setting the color of water, but as they pass a little blue, it is enough for grey & another color. Grey is the lesser color after varnish which is of two colors, either yellow or black.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Yellow varnish</span>

 
One whitens very well & one cleans the guards well. Next, one with a feather, one coats them cold with a feather all of <span class="m">walnut <span class="del">olive</span> oil</span>, and next turn them over a good <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire that is in the <span class="pro">furbishers</span>' furnace, without them touching the <span class="m">charcoal</span> or the <span class="m">ashes</span>. And when they do not smoke anymore, it is done.
