## For making <span class="m">blue varnish</span>

 
Take the <span class="m">blue of flowers <span class="add">florey or of <span class="pl">Flanders</span></span></span> & <span class="m">quicklime</span>, and put in around four <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> of <span class="m">water</span>, and let it soak one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">day</span></span>. Take the <span class="m">water</span> where the said <span class="m">quicklime</span> has soaked, and put your <span class="m">blue</span> with it, and lay it down on the <span class="m">wood</span>.
 
 
  

## For orange color

 
Take <span class="m">water</span> where the <span class="m">quicklime</span> has soaked and put <span class="m">terroy merita</span>, and put them one with the other, and then set on your <span class="m">wood</span>.
 
 
  

## For ridding <span class="m">bone</span> or <span class="m">horn</span> of fattiness

 
One needs to make them boil in <span class="m">quicklime</span>, and it must always have <span class="m">water</span>, and take a very clean <span class="tl">pan</span>. And when they are washed, make them boil in the <span class="m">ashes of <span class="pa">vine shoots</span></span>, and put them inside the hottest <span class="tl">pot</span> you can, and put <span class="m">verdigris</span> into the <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pro">goldsmith's</span> water</span> pot</span>, and leave for the space of some time, and you will see a very beautiful green color.
 
 
  

## For making gray <span class="m">wood</span>

 
Take <span class="m">alum</span> with <span class="m">river water</span>, make them boil together, then take <span class="m">river water</span> with <span class="m">bran</span>, submerge the <span class="m">bran</span> and beat it together. Take <span class="m">iron filings</span> & <span class="m">sulfur</span> & <span class="m">verdigris</span> and <span class="add"><span class="m">fuller's earth</span></span> , and make it all boil together, and pound <span class="m"><span class="pa">maplewood</span></span> which will have been soaked in <span class="m">water of alum</span> and <span class="m">well water</span>, & put it to boil together. <span class="add">All of this will be done better in hollow <span class="m">sandstone</span>.</span>
 
 
  

## For making <span class="m">bronze</span> in gold color

 
Take one <span class="ms">ounce</span> of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> and grind it in an <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> mortar</span>. Once well ground, take one <span class="ms">ounce</span> of <span class="m">sulfur</span>, and
