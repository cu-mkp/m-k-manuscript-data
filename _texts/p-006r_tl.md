## For laying down and setting <span class="m">burnished gold</span> and giving red or green or blue

 
 <span class="m">Ceruse</span> & <span class="m">lead white</span> is not appropriate for polished white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for <span class="m">or mat</span> that is made with <span class="m">oil</span> by mixing it with yellow <span class="m">ochre</span> & <span class="m">mine</span> <span class="del">po</span> & by tempering all of it with <span class="m">oil</span>. And this <span class="m">or mat</span> thus applied keeps <span class="env">in the rain</span> like <span class="m">gilded leadwork</span> & similar things. Therefore for <span class="m">burnished gold</span> take <span class="m">good chalk, quite white, well ground</span>, & soaked with <span class="m">distemper glue</span>, & make four layers of it, one after the other, on the <span class="m">wood</span>. And once the last is dry, rub it with <span class="m"><span class="pa">prele</span></span>, which is a plant otherwise called <span class="m"><span class="pa">horsetail</span></span>, to render it well polished. Next take <span class="m">fine <span class="pl">Armenian </span>bole</span> & <span class="m">sanguine</span>, as much of one as of the other, <span class="m"><span class="al">lamb </span>tallow</span> as large as a <span class="m"><span class="pa">bean</span></span> or a <span class="m"><span class="pa">pea</span></span> depending on the quantity of <span class="m">bole</span>, and a little of <span class="m"><span class="pa">willow</span> charcoal</span> or as much as the <span class="m">tallow</span>, & <span class="ms">half a <span class="pa">walnut</span> shell</span> full of half—burned <span class="m"><span class="pa">saffron</span></span>. Some put in a little <span class="m">candi sugar</span>. Grind all together with <span class="m">water</span>, & apply it without <span class="m">gum</span> or <span class="m">glue</span>, & let it dry, & rub the place that you want to gild with a piece of white <span class="tl">cloth</span> to better make even, & when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that the <span class="m">gold</span> will carry itself well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean <span class="tl">pinceau</span> soaked in <span class="m">clear water</span> the place that you want to gild & immediately apply the <span class="m">gold</span>, which you will burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in <span class="m">rouge clair</span> & glaze with it <span class="del">de</span>, grind <span class="m"><span class="pl">Venice </span>lake platte</span> on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> with <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span></span>. Once ground, mix <span class="m">turpentine varnish or <span class="pa">spike lavender</span></span> & apply on the <span class="m">gold</span> with the <span class="tl">pinceau</span>. <span class="m"><span class="pa">Brazilwood</span></span> & <span class="m">lake ronde</span> die. For green, temper <span class="m">verdigris</span> with <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut oil</span></span> or <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span></span> & grind, next mix in <span class="m">turpentine varnish and not of <span class="pa">spike lavender</span></span>, which is not suitable for <span class="m">verdigris</span>. If you want to glaze with <span class="m">azure</span>, it needs to be set on <span class="m">burnished silver</span> and take <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span>, &, without grinding, temper it with <span class="m">turpentine varnish</span> & apply it.
