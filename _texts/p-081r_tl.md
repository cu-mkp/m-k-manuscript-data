## Sand

 
One can find an excellent one <span class="env">on the little hill</span> of <span class="pl">Puy David</span> near <span class="pl">Thoulouse</span> for <span class="m">lead</span>, <span class="m">tin</span> & <span class="m">copper</span>. It does not want to be too reheated much because, drying out all at once, it loses its stickiness & burns at the first arrival of <span class="m">metal</span>, which makes the work lumpy & not neat. It is better to reheat from a distance, rather than with a <span class="m">straw</span> flame, which generates <span class="del">des</span> some <span class="m">filth</span>. Before filling in the <span class="tl">box mold</span>, you can put in the finest sand you have in a <span class="tl">very fine <span class="m">linen</span></span>, & pound the medal dry and then the moistened sand that you put on top, which has more body, will grip it.

## <span class="m">Earth</span> for molding

 
<span class="m"><span class="pro">Tanner</span>'s earth, or the one with which <span class="pro">potters</span> make a whitening on pots</span> to make <span class="m">lead</span> run better on them & to prevent the <span class="m">lead</span> from being absorbed into them, is very good for molding the cavities of things you want mold in relief. It releases better than <span class="m">plaster</span> or <span class="m">sulphur</span> which become hard once they have set. For the <span class="m">earth</span> being ready, one ought to be beat hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very large you can mould it in several parts. If you reheat it, it is necessary that it be over a closed fire. One finds this <span class="m">earth</span> at <span class="pl">Fosseret</span> & in another place called <span class="pl">Ox</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Plaster</span>

 
It is necessary that it be well heated, which you will recognize when cooking it in an <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">metal</span> skillet</span>, you mix it with an <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> rod</span>, & if it attaches to the <span class="m">iron</span>, it is not heated enough, if not, it is good. The <span class="m">water</span> with which you moisten should be a little warm & the <span class="tl">mold</span> made with the aforesaid <span class="m">earth</span> also a little hot. The work of <span class="m">plaster</span> does not last & the faces & delicate things break if one does not give a coat of <span class="m">glue</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Carton</span>

 
One ought to take <span class="m">paper from <span class="pl">Florence</span></span>, which is the finest, & crush it & soak it several times & change the <span class="m">water</span> <span class="tmp">every day</span>, so that it does not smell bad, & since you will have moulded it in the cavity, put a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span></span> over it, & from the back, rub the back of the <span class="m">paper</span> with a <span class="tl">tooth</span>, as if you wanted to burnish it, and it will mould very neatly. Then <span class="m">glue</span> the <span class="m">cloth</span> on the back with <span class="m">strong glue</span>.
