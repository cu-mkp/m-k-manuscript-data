## <span class="m">Varnish of spike lavender oil</span>

 
One needs to heat <span class="m">lavender spike oil</span> and as it begins to simmer, put in <span class="m">powdered sandarac gum</span> so that it soon melts. And over a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire stir continuously until the <span class="m">sandarac</span> is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said <span class="m">varnish</span> on a <span class="tl">plate</span>. And if it is fatty when you handle it with a <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>, it is ready. And for one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">lavender spike oil</span>, you will put five <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="m">pulverized sandarac</span>, although some only put in four <span class="ms">ounces</span>, but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is promptly dry. <span class="pro">Framemakers</span>, to avoid the trouble of polishing their <span class="m">ebony</span>, varnish it with this, as do <span class="pro">guitarmakers</span>. This is not as appropriate for panels as that of <span class="m">fine turpentine</span>, though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to varnish the landscape of a panel when <span class="m">linseed varnish</span> was in use, because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of <span class="m">turpentine</span>, one varnishes everything. You can put in <span class="m">pulverized mastic</span> extracted in tears or otherwise, and it will be more dessicative in place of <span class="m">sandarac</span>.
 
If you want to varnish on <span class="m">plaster</span> or a wall, first put on your very hot <span class="m">colle de retaille</span>, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall, & when you would put your <span class="m">varnish</span> on, it would come off.

## To remove <span class="m">varnish</span> from an old panel that has yellowed & varnish it anew

 
Take <span class="m">white soap</span> & <span class="m"><span class="tl">sieved</span> ashes</span>, & soak both in <span class="m">water</span>. And with a <span class="tl">sponge</span>, take the said <span class="m">ashes</span> & <span class="m">soap</span> & rub the panel with them. And as you see that the old <span class="m">varnish</span> is removed, throw a <span class="tl"><span class="ms">bucket</span></span> of <span class="m">water</span> against the panel to clean it. Next put it for <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">a quarter of an hour</span></span> <span class="env">in the sun</span> to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel dries, you can apply your <span class="m">turpentine varnish</span>.
