## <span class="al">Birds</span>

 
<span class="al">Calandra larks</span> and all <span class="al">birds</span> taken from the nest and which have not known freedom are better, because those taken with a net never sing as well. However, <span class="al">wild birds</span> give much pleasure with their chanting, but they must be taken before Michaelmas, otherwise they do not live long. All get a small impostume on the fork of their tail, sometimes, which some call "gaillardise", which makes them sick and sometimes kills them, especially <span class="al">calandra larks</span>. One can tell when they are sad and do not sing. It must be pierced, not with a pin, but very delicately by turning with the tip of a quite sharp <span class="m">feather</span>. The <span class="al">calandra lark</span> should not be without <span class="m">river sand</span>, and grey sand, a little rough, is the best. It rubs itself against it and purges itself with it. 
 
 
  

## Grain of <span class="m">lead</span>

 
Take a <span class="del">pierced</span> <span class="tl">playing card</span>, pierced with a <span class="tl">pin</span> or <span class="tl">needle</span>, folded on all four sides. Hold it with the end of a small <span class="tl">split stick</span> and, holding the said <span class="tl">stick</span> by the<span class="del">un bout</span> <span class="add">other</span> end, put your <span class="tl">card</span> three or 4 <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> away from the <span class="m">water</span> that you will have put in a <span class="tl">dish</span> or similar <span class="tl">vessel</span>. Then pour your <span class="m">lead</span>, which should not be too hot, into the <span class="tl">card</span> & continually tap on the <span class="tl">stick</span> that holds it. And thus your <span class="m">lead</span> will turn into round grains. And pass it through a large <span class="tl">sieve</span> to separate the largest grain from the smallest. The larger one will reach 25 to 30 <span class="ms">paces</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Birds</span>

 
Those that are caught at Michaelmas are good to keep, but those that are caught in March die, because they are starting to fall in love. <span class="al">Ortolans</span> are fed <span class="m">oats</span> all summer so that they eat without getting fat, to be more suitable for hunting and helping to catch others. Then, when one wants to fatten them to sell, one gives them <span class="m">millet</span>. They sing at night. They must be caught after mid—July and before Michaelmas, because after the period when they have their young in this country, they leave as <span class="al">turtledoves</span> do. <span class="al">Siskins</span> should also be caught after All Saints' Day and before Christmas, because afterwards they leave for the mountains to brood.
