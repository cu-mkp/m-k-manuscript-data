## <span class="m">Sal ammoniac</span> and <span class="m">alabaster</span>

 
 <span class="m">Sal ammoniac, well pulverized</span> <span class="del">mou</span> & ground dry on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, molds very neatly & makes a very beautiful, & once mixed with <span class="m">alabaster, pulverized</span> similarly, ii <span class="ms">℥</span> per <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">alabaster</span>, makes it release well. It sufficient to moisten it in a <span class="env">cave</span> or <span class="env">in the <span class="tmp">serain</span></span> or, to be done more quickly, in a <span class="tl">piece of <span class="m">paper</span></span> between a wet <span class="tl">napkin</span>. Take heed that it does not stay for too long, for it would become so wet that it would not be good for molding in a <span class="tl">frame</span>, but rather in a noyau, in which you will be able to use it well as long as dries well at ease & far from the fire. Otherwise the heat makes it swell, & push the <span class="m">salt</span> onto the surface, which renders it lumpy. You can <span class="del">in</span> smear the medal with <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>, molding in noyau. It is better to put in 4 <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> per <span class="ms">lb</span>, and moisten it <span class="env">in a damp place</span> for two or three <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>, & so that when you take <span class="bp">fistfuls</span>, it holds together, without, however, attaching itself & being pasted to your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hand</span></span>. You will with it mold very neatly. But let it dry & reheat really well, leaving the <span class="tl">mold</span> inside, so that it acquires strength by reheating, for it becomes hard as <span class="m">stone</span>, & and in this way is more certain to release well. Otherwise if you release before having reheated it, there would be danger of it crumbling in some place, because of its delicateness & fineness, even if the medal of high relief. Once you have molded with it, pulverize it as before and put it back <span class="env">in dampness</span>.

>   All sand that releases well has body & sticks well. <span class="m">Ammoniac</span> is fat and <span class="del">a va</span> however, is <span class="m">areneux</span> which makes it release well. There is no better bond than <span class="m">salts appropriate for metals</span>, for once mixed in powder, they get moistened together & dry &reheat together.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pro">Glassmaker</span>'s white sand from the <span class="env">mine</span></span>, mixed with <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>

 
There is found in <span class="pl">Cominge</span>, near the <span class="env">town</span> of <span class="pl">Aurignac</span>, a sand, white <span class="del">mai</span>, like <span class="m">salt</span>, and lean, that <span class="pro">glassmakers</span> & <span class="pro">potters</span> use, which renders impalpable crushed on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span> & is easy to crush. And once crushed, it resembles <span class="m">calcined alabaster</span>. It molds very neatly, and I have not found any that molds as delicately as this one for low relief. It is excellent to mold en noyau without a frame, having crushed it impalpable with <span class="m">gummed or pure water</span> on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, then placing it, thick as <span class="m">mustard</span> or a little more, on the medal, smeared with a <span class="m">oil either <span class="pa">olive</span>, <span class="pa">walnut</span>, even better <span class="pa">spike lavender</span></span>. But to do it better <span class="del">mo</span>, let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or two <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>. Although, if you are in a hurry, you can heat it well, & it will not crack, if it is not put on too lightly. It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes some holes & bubbles, which it does not do when dried in the cold or at ease, rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it & it will withstand several casts.
