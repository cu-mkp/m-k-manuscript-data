*[continued]*
  
Your lute once dry, put your crucible in an four a vent in the early morning, & at the beginning, give low fire, as much as you need to heat your crucible as to let the fury of the <span class="m">saltpeter</span> pass gently. Then, little by little & with judgement intensify the fire. And <span class="del">y</span> leave in the fullness of this your ingredients for 12 hours, or a natural day. Make at each go a good quantity of this mixture to not have to repeat it too often, because the fumes, which are dangerous, could hurt you. And before working with it, take a good piece of buttered toast in the morning, and hold in your mouth the said <span class="m">butter</span>, or <span class="m">zedoary</span>, or <span class="m">gold</span> coins, and <span class="del">ada</span> cover your face with a towel from the eyes down. From this mass, the crust will serve to <span class="del">make run</span> clarify <span class="del">the great works of</span> the <span class="m">silver</span> from the metallic mass <span class="del">like <span class="al">snakes</span> & similar things</span> when it starts to melt. <span class="del">But</span> And then, the grain that will be at the bottom of the <span class="tl">crucible</span> should be reserved for <span class="del">principally delicate flowers and herbs</span> putting a little in the melted <span class="m">silver</span> when you want to cast it, <span class="del">However it is necessary to always put a little of this grain in the <span class="m">silver</span> when <span class="del">you want to cast</span> it is melted and when you are ready to cast</span> as you do thus for fine <span class="m">tin</span> on <span class="m">copper</span>, & for <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> on <span class="m">lead</span> and on <span class="m">tin</span>. And just as <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> makes <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span> too brittle if you put in too much, likewise the grain composed of the above—mentioned ingredients would make your silver too brittle if <span class="del">l</span> you were to put in too much, and obscure it. This above—mentioned composition will suffice you for a long time, when it has been on a <span class="del">low</span> low fire for a whole day at the beginning & intensified degree by degree until the end. Having thrown one load of charcoal, let it consume itself, & let your <span class="tl">crucible</span> cool down. Then break it. You will find two sheets & hard cakes in the <span class="tl">crucible</span>. The upper one looks stoned <span class="del">Once</span>, once composed of <span class="m">salts</span>,sublimated & mixed together. The lower one is metallic, composed of fillings, <span class="m">aes ustum</span> & <span class="m">antimony</span>, having very small grain. Pulverize the upper cake, made from <span class="m">salts</span>, & put some in to lighten & clean the <span class="m">silver</span> and the metallic grain can be used to put into the melted metal.

>   One sells this metallic mass to <span class="pro">silversmiths</span> to soften their solder, because when melting <span class="m">brass</span> exhales. And with a little of this mixture, they solder over the other solder.
