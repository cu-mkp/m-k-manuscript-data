## Drawing

 
To become an <span class="pro">artist</span>, one needs to draw by <span class="tl"><span class="bp">eye</span></span>, without <span class="tl">compass</span> or <span class="tl">ruler</span>. <span class="pro">Masters</span> do not allow <span class="pro">apprentices</span> to do this.
 
When the priming has been <span class="tmp">long</span> done, it becomes greasy. One needs to rub it with <span class="m">ash</span> & <span class="m">water</span>.
 
 
  

## Perspective

 
To know the point, one needs to lay down a <span class="tl">ruler</span> over the lines, & at the intersection of these the point will be. Some make a hole at the end of their <span class="tl">rulers</span> to fix the point by that hole & move the <span class="tl">ruler</span> about. Others lay down a <span class="tl">ruler</span> across the panel, then on this laid—down <span class="tl">ruler</span> they set the <span class="tl">tip of another ruler</span>, which, attached to the former by way of a <span class="tl">screw</span>, moves about & reaches as far as necessary without losing the point. The <span class="tl">ruler</span> and <span class="tl">compass</span> without the <span class="tl">judgement of the <span class="bp">eye</span></span> cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

>   To paint perspective in <span class="m">oil</span>, you ought not to use a <span class="tl">ruler</span>, for you would smudge everything. But when layering your colors you need to keep to <span class="del">the</span> & follow the lines of your first drawing.
 
Also, to make <span class="tl"><span class="m">plumb</span> lines</span>, which go from the top <span class="del">to make</span> <span class="del">vif</span> to the bottom of the panel, you need to have a <span class="tl"><span class="m">thread</span></span> with some piece of <span class="m">lead</span> attached to one end & a little <span class="tl">hook</span> to the other for hanging the said <span class="tl"><span class="m">thread</span></span> from the top of the panel.

## Panel

 
To draw & layer the colors, especially in <span class="m">oil</span>, you need to hold your panel as upright as you can on the <span class="tl">easel</span>, for if it is slanted there is a danger that some dust & dirt might stick on it. Keep clean & without dust the place where you paint.
