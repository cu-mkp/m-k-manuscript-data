## <span class="m">Water</span> to give light for the <span class="pro">painter</span>

 
Distill some <span class="m">vine water</span> & put it into a big bottle. And behind this, put your <span class="m">candle</span>, & it will not hinder your vision.
 
 
  

## <span class="pl">German</span> chassis

 
<span class="pl">Germans</span> who work in miniature make chassis not of <span class="m">glass</span>, but of <span class="m">canvas</span> oiled with <span class="m">clear turpentine varnish</span>, namely <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> & <span class="ms">almost half</span> <span class="m">turpentine</span>, because this light, which is not as bright as <span class="m">glass</span>, makes them see larger features. And when they want to make something subtle like veins <span class="del">de</span> & similar things, they use <span class="tl">pinceaulx composed of two or three <span class="m"><span class="al">rat</span>whiskers</span></span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Azur d’esmail</span> in <span class="m">oil</span>

 
One needs too choose the most <span class="del"> beautiful</span> delicate that will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in <span class="m">oil</span>. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can crush it well, not with <span class="m">water</span> but with <span class="m">oil</span>, & crush it thickly. Next lay it on your palette & mix in a little <span class="m">turpentine</span>, but not much, to give it a bond, and make it to be as thick as <span class="m">butter</span> or <span class="m">mortar</span>, & then, with a fairly large pinceau, work it by always moving the pinceau back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch across it in a jagged manner with <span class="del">the</span> the tip of the pinceau. The highlights will be made with <span class="del">d</span> the same thinned with <span class="m">ceruse</span>, which, giving it a bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, & such that you all but struggle to spread it with your pinceau. And it is all the better if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it is very subtle & thin without being crushed, and does not run.

>   <span class="m">Azure</span> wants to be layered neatly, which is why <span class="del">whe</span> it always dies somewhat when layers it over old, already tarnished, <span class="m">azure</span> to mend an old panel. In such matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer & prime again, then put down the <span class="m">azure</span>. It is thus for almost all other colors. Also, azure crushed with <span class="m">oil</span> always remains shiny, which is not a good sign for <span class="m">azure</span> for this causes it to die.
 
 
  

## Crushing colors

 
A slab of <span class="del">marble & p</span> <span class="m">glass</span> one <span class="del">glass</span> thumb thick is more appropriate than anything else for crushing colours neatly, especially for <span class="m">lake</span> & for <span class="m">whites</span>.
