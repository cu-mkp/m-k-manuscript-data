## <span class="pro">Painter</span>

 
<span class="pro">Scribes</span> achieve darkening of <span class="m">lake</span> & other colors for garments with <span class="m">egg yolk</span>, but this is a delusion and does not last.
 
Others glaze <span class="m">rouges de mine</span> & others which are not beautiful in <span class="m">oil</span> <span class="del">M</span>using <span class="m">egg white</span>, and it appears to be done in <span class="m">oil</span>. But <span class="env">humidity</span> corrupts all this.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Broisses</span>

 
Take those that have been used a little by <span class="pro">white—limers</span>, for the harshness of the <span class="m">quick—lime</span> & use make them easier to handle.
 
 
  

## Painting after nature

 
One ought not to undertake to work on it in <span class="env">overcast weather</span> because you would make your flesh tones browner than they ought to be.
 
 
  

## Paindre d’aprest

 
For blue, they take the roughest <span class="m">azure d'email</span> & grind it on <span class="tl"><span class="m">shale</span></span>, & mix in two or three <span class="ms">rosary beads</span>' worth of <span class="m">roquaille</span> or more, according to the quantity of the work. And having done their drawing with <span class="m">noir d’escaille</span> (which is painted towards the light with the piece of <span class="m">glass</span> upright), they lay all their pieces on <span class="m">white paper</span> <span class="del">when</span> for knowing by the whiteness of the <span class="m">paper</span> the lighting of their histories and <span class="del">as</span> set down all colors which are of one kind all in one go. Then they heat it up.
