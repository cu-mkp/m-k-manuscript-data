*[continued]*
  
G mortar with handles placed with its rod.
 
H knife—like saws to cut, if needed, a portcullis.
 
J the big <span class="m">iron</span> rods that cross and tie the mortar.
 
K are like <span class="m">iron</span> rods, all round and covered with cloths, like all the rest, so as to make the big <span class="m">iron</span> rods, pierced close to the button, turn.
 
L axes that one must always carry to chop and to break, in the fortuitous case that the mortar has left anything entirely.
 
M a large <span class="m">wood</span> mallet for knocking down what was begun and weakened by the axes and "birons".
 
N are big wheelwright augers and birons for easily cutting a door or window by making large holes close to one another.
 
O crutches as tall as a man that must be carried to put under a portcullis immediately after the canon has been shot and to prevent the portcullis from falling.
 
P are small <span class="m">iron</span> pincers for putting any low mortar against the bolt of a door.
