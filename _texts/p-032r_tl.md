## The body of the cuirass

 
The high lames of the spaulder in a vambrace @ are like a master's chef d'œuvre, because these pieces have to be very precisely hollowed and adjusted so that movement may be free. The bodies of cuirasses must be very evenly beaten and worked with a hammer.
 
Morions from <span class="pl">Milan</span> are all in one piece and thus better than which are of two.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Painter</span>

 
As soon as the colors of panels are well dried, the <span class="pl">Flemish</span> varnish them so they do not die any further & remain in that state.
 
The one who knows to work well in <span class="m">distemper</span> will work well in <span class="m">oil</span>. But, on the contrary, the one who knows how to work well in <span class="m">oil</span> will not work in <span class="m">distemper</span>.
 
 
  

## For layering <span class="m">gold</span> in distemper

 
Common <span class="pro">painters</span> & <span class="pro">scribes</span> make <span class="m">batture</span>, which is <span class="m"><span class="pro">joiner</span>'s glue</span> tempered with <span class="m">water</span> on the fire, moderately clear, mixed with very little <span class="m">honey</span>, that is to say a few <span class="ms">drops</span> to make it stick, and with it they they form letters, or that which they want to <span class="m">gild</span>, with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, and immediately after layer the <span class="m">gold</span>, but they never do their work quite neatly, and if there is a lot of <span class="m">honey</span> it dries only with great difficulty. This layer is undone <span class="env">in the rain</span>.
 
Others do better, they temper <span class="m">candy sugar</span> in <span class="m">water</span> and mix it with <span class="m">sanguine</span> that they call <span class="m">cocon</span>, thoroughly crushed, adding a little <span class="m">soap</span>. This is done neatly, & renders <span class="m">gold</span> beautiful if one uses it as the ground layer.
