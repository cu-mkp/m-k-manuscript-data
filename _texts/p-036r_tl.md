Make a small case of plain <span class="m">cow leather</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pl">Spanish</span> goat's leather</span> quite thick, as high as three fingers, sewn like the finger of a glove and large enough that two fingertips can fit inside and which, at the tip, is a little creased, and has a round hole as large as a double liard. Take two <span class="m">boxwood</span> balls that look the same, and one should be hollowed and opened by a round hole only on one side so that the thimble can enter. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your <span class="m">leather</span> case on the table with the ball that is not hollow. Put a stick into the <span class="m">leather</span> case to show that there is nothing inside it, also show the round ball, and hold the hollow one which has the thimble inside it between your little and ring finger, and do this with your right hand with which you hold the stick. After, take the <span class="m">leather</span> case and place it over the hollow ball which is between your fingers and pretend you put some <span class="m">goldibus powder</span> upon it, and replace the <span class="m">leather</span> case that contains the ball on the table, then you take the large round ball remaining on the table, and order it to enter from upon the table into the <span class="m">leather</span> case. Then, lifting the <span class="m">leather</span>, it will seem to be the same, although it is the hollow one. Then, cover it and command that it should become invisible, and lifting the case while pressing it, you will remove it at the same time as the ball, and meanwhile discreetly put it back in the case. In its place will be found a thimble for the ladies whose bottom hurts, that is the bottom of the needle.
