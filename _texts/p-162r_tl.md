## For La Boutique

 
 According to Herodotus the Portuguese did not invent [deep sea] navigation as they put about. At the beginning of the first book entitled Clio, he says that the Phoenicians used to come navigating straight across from the Red Sea to the Greek coast, mainly to Argos, where they would bring merchandise from Egypt and Assyria, which they usually sold out within 6 days.

##  Aes ustum 

 
 When it is finely ground it moulds very cleanly. It has a certain fatness that makes it bind better than filings, I believe that it may not be ill suited for casting.
 
 
  

##  Rotten wood

 
 Wood that is white, being light as a sponge, if burnt in a close fire, may be used for casting lead in a box and molds very cleanly, but these things [such material] do not withstand [open?] fire.
