a sign that there is some humidity, and if the flower was also somewhat watery it would rot. Nor should it be <span class="del"></span> too rough, because its weight would burden the flower and make it lose its original shape. Once you have chosen it as needed, take a <span class="tl">box</span> and inside this start by making a small mound of sand on top of which you will lay the stalk of the flower flat, so that the flower touches neither the bottom nor the edges of the <span class="tl">box</span> but remains in the air. Then add more <span class="del"></span> sand on the stalk so that it remains firm and fixed. Finally take some of the same sand and pulverize and sprinkle it finely with two <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> on the flower, imitating the flow of an <span class="ms"><span class="tl">hourglass</span></span>. And once the flower is <span class="del"></span> half covered or so, strike with your <span class="bp"><span class="tl">fist</span></span> the table on which the <span class="tl">box</span> is laid, so that the sand drops and enters everywhere. Finally cover the entire flower and lay other flowers in order, one over the other, as many as the <span class="tl">box</span> will hold. After you have arranged them thus, put the <span class="tl">box</span> out in <span class="env">hot sun</span> for <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">several days</span></span>. And while the flower is drying, the sand that is packed together, by continuously holding it, does not allow it to shrivel and shrink. On the contrary, it needs to dry remaining in the same state as when you put it there. But to that effect take care you chose <span class="pa">knapweed</span>s, <span class="pa">marigold</span>s, the <span class="pa">yellow meadow flowers</span> called <span class="pa">ranunculus</span> or <span class="pa">palta lupina</span>, <span class="pa">amaranth</span>s, and similar flowers, such as <span class="pa">broom</span> and others that you will know from experience.

Then dry the sand well in the <span class="env">sun</span> for <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">several days</span></span> in order to remove its humidity, and ventilate it as you would do with <span class="m">wheat</span> so that the dust becomes separated from it. After taking that dust, well dried, use it as you know.

## Keeping fruits throughout the <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">year</span></span>

 
You need to pick them in calm and quite dry weather & by the stem, without <span class="sn">touching</span> the fruits with your <span class="bp">hand</span>, and to put them into <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> bottles</span> that have wide necks, such as tall <span class="m">glass</span> <span class="tl">jars</span> for preserves. Protect them with <span class="m">straw</span> or something else so that they may not break, and seal them well with <span class="m">wax</span> so that they may not breathe. And if they have <span class="m">glass</span> lids well sealed with <span class="m">wax</span>, it will be all the better. Put them in a <span class="tl">case</span> and put this in the <span class="env">well</span>, or in the <span class="env">cellar</span>, or in a vat or plot of <span class="m">earth</span> full of <span class="m">water</span>.

>   Because wherever the <span class="bp">hand</span> <span class="sn">touches</span> them they will rot, and it is even best not to breathe on them. You can also put <span class="m">vine leaves</span> with them.
