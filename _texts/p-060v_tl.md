## <span class="m">Varnish</span> dry in an <span class="tmp">hour</span>

 
Take <span class="m">white <span class="add">turpentine</span> oil</span> <span class="add">&</span> <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="m">mastic, pulverized & passed subtly through a <span class="tl">sieve</span></span>, & boil them together, stirring continuously with a <span class="tl">stick</span> just until it is dry. And put in two <span class="ms">liards</span> of good <span class="m">eau de vie</span>. And if you extract the tear of <span class="m">mastic</span>, it will be whiter & clearer. There is no need to put in <span class="m">turpentine</span>, but only its <span class="m">white turpentine oil</span> & <span class="m">mastic pulverized</span> at your discretion, until it has enough body. \+

## How to clean paintings

 
Some clean them with soapy <span class="m">water</span>, others with <span class="m">urine</span>, others with <span class="m">white wine</span>, for dust damages the colors.

** <span class="m">Aspic oil</span> **

 
Do not put any into colors because it is so strong and penetrating that it makes the colors flake and afterwards they come off. And that is why painters use it to clean their brushes when they are dry, because it softens and cleans them immediately by penetrating the dry color which makes them solid. Sometimes painters who are jealous of the work started by another, secretly, in the evening, pour a few drops of <span class="m">aspic oil</span> on the top edge of the painting so that, running down, it produces a stain that penetrates as far as the <span class="m">wood</span> and makes the colors come off. St that, in order to make their work even and uniform, they need to redo it completely and so they lose their efforts.

 
  

## <span class="m">Wood</span> color

 
 One gives a layer of <span class="m">bistre</span>, then a coat of <span class="m">varnish</span>.

 
  

## Flemish work

 
They do all their <span class="m">oil</span> paintings with the tip of the brush, like good illuminators, and grind their colors very finely, avoid any dust and often clean off the fragments of hair released by their brushes, for if these should remain on the painting it would be difficult to work neatly, which they do with great care. Thus their work appears very soft, especially small paintings, which require more diligence since one sees them closer. They usually complete the forehead, then the eyes, then the nose, finally the mouth and the rest. But they do not proceed like some others who apply two or three different flesh tones, one yellowish and one darker, because the colors always mix and end by fading. They just make their underlayer carefully.
