## <span class="pro">Founder</span>

 
The <span class="m">metal</span> whitens the more it is melted, because the <span class="m">tin</span> does not go away but rather mixes in more. And, by holding it a long time in the fire, the <span class="m">filth</span> is eaten away, which makes it brittle. If you want to chase away the <span class="m">tin</span> from the <span class="m">copper</span>, after it is well hot, throw in <span class="m">saltpeter</span> often. This only & not the fire separates it, & purifies it, & eats the <span class="m">filth</span> away. The <span class="m">metal</span> is cast very neatly.

Have some <span class="m">wormwood powder</span>, dissolve it in some <span class="m">capilli veneris syrup</span> or <span class="m">preserves</span>, and make an opiate that you will take once a week on a piece of <span class="m">bread</span> dipped in <span class="m">wine</span>. Then you will be able to drink a bit of fully dipped <span class="m">wine</span>. This clears the phlegm and gas which come from there. You can take six <span class="m">pepper</span> grains, and grate their <span class="m">rinds</span> so they are smooth, and swallow them without chewing them. This heals the stomach without warming the liver.
 
 
  

## Sheets for precious stones

 
Once they have been made, do not keep them in any <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">metal</span> box because this stains them. But in some box of
 
 
  

## For preventing candles from dripping and making them [candles] white

 
Once they have been made, put in a mould some fresh <span class="m">water</span> whipped with some <span class="m">bran</span>, which should by no means be purged again of its <span class="m">flour</span>, so that the <span class="m">water</span> is white. And dip your candles in this. Then leave them to dry. And do so thusly two or three times.
