## Hairy animals and very fragile and thin <span class="pa">flowers</span>

 
Hairy animals are difficult to mold because hairs raise up & come out looking intermingled & in clumps. At the beginning, it is necessary to keep it flat with a drying agent & that makes it firmer. And in this, the best thing to use is <span class="m">wheat oil</span>, with which you will dawb it. Once cast, you will be able to repair it. The bodies of <span class="m">butterflies</span> and <span class="m">herbs</span> that have a <span class="m">stem</span> & <span class="m">leaves</span> that are flocked with capricious & downy<span class="m">hairs</span> need to be daubed with the same <span class="m">oil</span> to keep these flocks flat; likewise <span class="m">flowers</span> that have very delicate & thin <span class="m">leaves</span> because dry <span class="m">wheat oil</span> makes them and rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding anything presented to them, give them the downy head of the herb called <span class="m">dandelion</span> to cast or a <span class="pa">pappus</span>, which comes from the seeds of <span class="pa">burdock</span> & takes flight at the slightest sigh of wind.
 
 
  

## Noyaulx for molding hollow

 
Animals of <span class="m">gold</span> & <span class="m">silver</span> are generally cast hollow to avoid weightiness, and costs as well, if they are not quite small. But in order to make the core & the noyau, the mold needs to be freshly molded and not dry.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Spider</span> web

 
It comes undone in <span class="m">water</span> & because of this, cannot be molded in a noyau, but one casts the <span class="m">spider</span> and then one draws the web <span class="m">filaments</span> that they make in the fields stretched between blades of <span class="m">grass</span> on some <span class="m">carton</span> with a stylus. One makes around it an edge of <span class="m">paper</span>, glued to the <span class="m">carton</span> & one casts with <span class="m">tin</span> mixed with very little <span class="m">lead</span>.
 
 
  

## Fine <span class="m">gold</span> 

 
There is a kind of <span class="m">gold</span> which, even though it is very fine & unalloyed & has been passed through <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> & <span class="m">antimony</span>, is however so brittle that it hardly withstands the hammer. And the composition of <span class="m">verdigris</span> mentioned above to make <span class="m">gold</span> flow, makes it as doux as <span class="m">lead</span>.
