## Double layers

 
The <span class="pl">Flemish</span> & those who paint panels by the dozen only make one layer & finish at the first go. But the colors soon die. And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer them lightly & not very thick, to soften them well.
 
 
  

## Shadows

 
For women, <span class="m">asphaltum</span>, <span class="m">umber</span> & a little <span class="m">lake</span>.
 
 
  

## Painting in <span class="m">distemper</span> on <span class="m">wood</span>

 
Because it is very tedious to paint in <span class="m">distemper</span> on <span class="m">wood</span>, and because one is at great pains to make a good <span class="del">a</span> face on it, some thin their colors with <span class="m">egg glair</span> passed through a <span class="tl">sponge</span>, or mixed with the <span class="m">yolk</span>, <span class="m">water</span>, & thoroughly beaten with the <span class="m">skin of the <span class="pa">fig tree</span></span>. With this | they paint & soften on the <span class="m">wood</span>, as with <span class="m">oil</span>, and this supports the <span class="m">varnish</span>, but this does not last.
 
 
  

## Colors in <span class="m">oil</span> that are imbibed

 
It is best that colors in <span class="m">oil</span> are imbibed, that is to say they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the <span class="m">oil</span> has remained in that part which would make the colors die. The <span class="m">varnish</span> mends all this & unites & renders it similar in one place as in another.
 
One needs gold color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it would be imbibed & would run.

## Gilding molding for panels with <span class="m">or mat</span>

 
see the other side of this folio this mark: *
 
The <span class="pl">Flemish</span> give one layer of <span class="m">colle à destrempe</span> on the moulding, then mix <span class="m">lamp black</span> or <span class="m">soot black</span> with the same <span class="m">colle</span> & let dry. Next they pounce some moresque in the corners & paint it with <span class="m">minium</span>, <span class="m">massicot</span>, & <span class="m">ochre de ru</span>, <span class="add">and a little <span class="m">yellow ocher</span></span>, mixed with <span class="m">fatty oil</span> in which they clean their <span class="tl">pinceaulx for <span class="m">oil</span></span>, because the three aforesaid colors are gripping & dry immediately. Next they lay down the <span class="m">gold</span>, then varnish on top of all. And it seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in <span class="m">oil</span>, but it would not be good because the <span class="m">gold</span> would attach itself everywhere & not only to the moresque.

>   * <span class="m">Or mat</span><br/> It is made with <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">minium</span>, <span class="m">ochre de ru</span>, & <span class="m">yellow ocher</span>, so that the composition resembles <span class="m">gold</span>. Gild <span class="tmp">the day after</span> <span class="del">un jo</span> it is laid down if you <span class="del">in the</span> made the groundlayer the <span class="tmp">evening</span> of the color. After having gilded, let it dry & rest one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">day</span></span>, next rub the gilding with a <span class="tl">feather</span> & <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pa">cotton</span></span></span> in order that no burrs remain, then varnish with <span class="m"><span class="pl">Flanders</span> varnish</span>, which you make mixed with a little <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, to render it desiccative.
 
The <span class="m">varnish</span> will be dry in an <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span>. It will increase the color of gold. And this <span class="m">or mat</span> holds <span class="env">in the rain</span>, even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried for eight or ten <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>.
 
Gold color that is made of different colors cleaned from <span class="tl">pinceaulx for <span class="m">oil</span></span> is not so good, & with <span class="tmp">time</span>, tarnishes the gold because of the <span class="m">verdigris</span>. One must not touch with a <span class="bp">finger</span> the layer made for the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The <span class="m">or moulu</span> is spoiled if <span class="m">water</span> touches it, but the <span class="m">or mat</span> holds well <span class="env">in the rain</span> & in <span class="m">water</span>. One must not burnish it, because the <span class="tl">tooth</span> would remove it. Gather the burrs & small flakes that the <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pa">cotton</span></span></span> makes lift off when the <span class="m">gold</span> is dry & you clean it, for an <span class="ms">ounce</span> is still <span class="m">gold</span>. In <span class="pl">Flanders</span>, women <span class="del">make</span> <span class="m">gild</span>. It is more beautiful when it is a little thick, but in <span class="pl">France</span> they beat it too delicately.
 
Breathe on the gold color, and if it tarnishes, it is dry enough, but if it does not receive the vapor of the breath, it is not enough.
 
One must not gild <span class="m">or mat</span> after <span class="del">with</span> having <span class="m">gilded</span>. But wait <span class="tmp">one day or one night</span>, <span class="del">But take heed to not</span> and when it appears as dry, it grips the <span class="m">gold</span>, next one varnishes.
