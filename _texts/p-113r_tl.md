a bit so that you can take it out if you need to. And be advised that these needle points must be of the thinnest kind of <span class="m">iron</span> wire, with a length that is suitable to the animal; because the smaller your needle is, the smaller the leftover hole will be. However, you must have different sized ones because there are some needles that go on the body and in places that are thicker, like under the throat, and some <span class="sup">needles</span> must be longer and stronger than the ones used on legs and thin places, where the needles must be subtle and thin, almost like the biggest harpsichord strings. And it would be better if they were of <span class="m">iron</span> wire, which is firmer than the one made of <span class="m">latten</span>. And if piece of a tail, a piece of nail or a piece of leg to the body needs to be joined to the body, do not use the needle; it would damage these parts. But apply a bit of <span class="m">wax</span>, as big as a <span class="m">grain of millet</span>, between the body and the end of the tail. Then with a bit of <span class="m">iron</span> wire, flattened and warm, touch the <span class="m">wax</span> and join the two pieces by applying a bit of pressure. In this way, after your animal has been well—placed on the lute—shaped pancake <span class="sup">of clay earth</span>,

 build around it a wall of the same <span class="m">clay</span>

 in this way. And join everything together. And then with a big knife, with which you have cut the <span class="m">clay</span>, take away the extraneous <span class="sup">clay</span> surrounding the pancake. And place on a piece at the end of the mold to close it off, as you see in B. Then, with a small curved instrument, mark on the inside of your mold the thickness you wish, which for a common <span class="al">serpent</span> must be two inches thick; so that when you put in your wet sand, you will see when it is thick enough. When all of this is neatly set out, moisten well the shaped body of the animal everywhere, with good <span class="m">spirits</span>, with a brush. For this is the best—kept secret: because everything that is touched by <span class="m">spirits</span> will come out very neatly and without any small eyes or holes that we call bubbles, which usually come not at the back or in the thick sides of the mold, but on the edges. And as soon as you have thusly moistened everything with <span class="m">spirits</span>, put in your wet sand without letting the <span class="m">spirits</span> evaporate, which they do quickly. And soak it thusly.

 and make sure the needle is as long as you need according to how much you want to raise the head, and that both ends are sharp. Having been arranged thusly, affix your <span class="al">serpent</span> on the <span class="m">clay earth</span>, and place the head first and then the rest.

> If, when you pierce the belly of your animal, it releases <span class="m">water</span> on the <span class="m">plaster</span>, clean it well with <span class="m">cotton</span> because the sand that was wet will become lumpy. If it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and very neatly and touch it and strongly wet it with <span class="m">spirits</span>.
 
 
  

## Wetting sand and molding the first cast

 
Have a porringer of <span class="m">leaded earth</span> of such a size that it can hold the wet sand which will be needed to fill your mold in one go, which is better than in two gos, because if you do not throw the second load of sand in very quickly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the first one will take and become solid,
