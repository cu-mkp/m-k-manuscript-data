## <span class="m">Crocum ferri</span>

 
It is made more quickly from <span class="m">iron rust</span> than <span class="m">filings</span>, because if you have good <span class="m">vinegar</span>, it will bubble on contact with <span class="m">rust</span> as if it were boiling, as if it were on fire, if you use filings it will not bubble up unless it is placed on the fire or warm ashes. However when you have put your <span class="m">filings</span> through <span class="m">vinegar</span>, and it has evaporated, and heated up and made it very warm, should you do this all for a second time, the <span class="m">vinegar</span> will be a lot stronger and your <span class="m">crocum</span> will be much more subtle and red. Those who use it to cast in <span class="m">gold</span> buy it for forty or fifty sols per ounce.

> It does not harden molds, and when you scrape <span class="sup">the mold</span> you cannot tell that it is harder. But it does make the mold more thinner, and it absorbs and attracts <span class="m">gold</span> better.

 
  

## <span class="m">Plaster</span>

 
You can mold with it as large a piece as you wish. But if you make a mold upon large works and pieces of <span class="m">wood</span>, it will not release cleanly unless you lather your <span class="m">wood</span> with very hot <span class="m">wax</span>. Because the <span class="m">wood</span> absorbs and drinks, and because of this, it drinks up the <span class="m">plaster</span>, which means it does not come out cleanly. You can assume the same thing will happen for any other large piece of <span class="m">wax</span>. But the cure for this is to lather the work that you wish to cast in <span class="m">plaster</span> with very hot <span class="m">wax</span>. In this way, it will not absorb, and will release very neatly.

## Plants that are difficult to burn in the noyau

 
Any herb that has a hard stem, like <span class="m">wood</span>, is very difficult to burn in the noyau, such as asparagus, thyme, and other similar things, because they remain as solid <span class="m">coal</span> in the small conduits, and if they are not reduced to ashes, it is not possible to remove them from the mold. In this case, some reheat them two or three times. Others in mixing some herbs together in the mold, pass through the herbs and the <span class="m">earth</span> circle, which is there to receive the tempered sand.
 
This is not due to the fact that those herbs have stems with lines in them because rosemary burns well. This is due to the nature of certain herbs.
