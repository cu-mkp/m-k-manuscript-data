## Pounced design for scratching <span class="m">satin</span>

 
After you have pounced with <span class="m">flour</span> or <span class="m">crushed chalk</span>, in order that the dots of the pounced design are not erased, follow the trace with <span class="m">glair</span> beaten with the <span class="m">milk</span> or <span class="m">bark of a <span class="pa">fig tree</span></span>, which will immediately make it clear up like <span class="m">water</span>, & without becoming thick, it will keep the trace that you will follow again & scratch with <span class="del">d</span> a <span class="tl">piece of <span class="m">glass</span></span> or a <span class="tl">pen—knife</span>.
 
 
  

## Canvas for painting in <span class="m">oil</span> without breaking

 
In order that your <span class="m">oil</span> painting be not broken or ruined when being bent, make your layer with <span class="m">honey</span> <span class="del">oil</span>, a bit of <span class="m">oil</span>, & <span class="m">water</span>, <span class="add">&</span> <span class="m">flour</span>.
 
 
  

## Painting in<span class="m">oil</span> on <span class="m">taffeta</span><span class="del">which</span>

 
In order that the <span class="m">oil</span> shall not run, make your first layer with <span class="m">honey</span>, <span class="m">water of alum</span>, & <span class="m">starch water</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand for casting</span>

 
The main thing is to grind it well on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, & that it be impalpable & mixed with a little <span class="m">calcined alabaster</span>.
 
 
  

## For tinseling a picture

 
Follow the lines with <span class="m">lake</span> ground with <span class="m"><span class="pa">olive</span> oil</span>, which will not dry.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">White varnish</span> on <span class="m">plaster</span>

 
Give two or three <span class="ms">coats</span> <span class="m">glue quite white</span> for painting. Next, varnish with <span class="m">varnish of <span class="m">sandarac</span>, <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>, and a little <span class="m">mastic</span></span>. And <span class="tmp">in the evening</span> put it into a <span class="tl">vessel</span>, all well—crushed together, without fire, which would turn it yellow. Then with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, it is dry immediately. Pour the <span class="m">oil</span>, which will have taken the substance.
