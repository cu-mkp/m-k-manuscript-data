## <span class="pro">Founders</span> of small <span class="m">tin</span> work

 
They usually cast from <span class="m">soft</span> <span class="m">solder</span> the things that should not become hollow, because hollow works require fine & <span class="m">soft</span> <span class="m">tin</span>. However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat & become hollow if they are mixed or include <span class="m">glass tin</span> <span class="del"></span> in them, just like they mix a little [<span class="m">glass tin</span>] in the <span class="m">soft tin</span>. They carve their work on <span class="m">stones</span> of which the sharpening stones or barber's files are made. These are found in great flakes near the mountains, & resemble slate. They are found in three colors: one <span class="m">reddish</span>, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain heat <span class="del"></span>; [another] one <span class="del"></span> is <span class="m">the color of dark slate</span>, and the other is <span class="m">whitish</span>. When they work a relief, first they print it on <span class="m">carton</span>, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their <span class="m">stones</span> & rubbing them together <span class="del"></span>, they use a compass & little <span class="m">iron tools</span> to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four <span class="m">stones</span>, to make a circle or a square with the <span class="m">stones</span> which join perfectly because the <span class="m">stones</span> are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with <span class="m">tallow</span>, and it [the mould] absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having [put] fine powder of <span class="m">quicklime</span> into a cloth, they rub the mould using <span class="m">pounce</span> in beating the <span class="m">linen</span> on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles [from forming]. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown [on the picture]. They make a hole in the medal, somewhere where it is least visible, & with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the medal.

 And if they want their work to last, they pierce [it] somewhere and fit in a piece of <span class="m">cork</span> & <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> will not damage it.
