## Casting in <span class="m">silver</span>

 
You need to place the animals as said, and make up the same sand out of <span class="ms">four parts</span> <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="ms">two parts</span> refired<span class="m">brick</span>, and <span class="ms">one part</span> annealed <span class="m">stone alum</span>. Mix it well, and once it is ready and you wish to mold, take <span class="ms">three parts</span> of the aforementioned sand in the earthenware <span class="tl">dish</span> from which the peasants eat their soup. Add pure annealed <span class="m">stone alum</span> that has been pulverized in the <span class="m">mortar</span>, as much as you can grab with your <span class="ms">four <span class="bp">finger</span>s and <span class="bp">thumb</span></span>, or a <span class="ms">small double handful</span>. Then, mix well and mix in a little of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> and the remainder with <span class="m">common water</span>\+

 And stir it with your <span class="tl">spatula</span> so that it all becomes like a thick sauce or clear <span class="m">mustard</span>. And having rubbed spirits on the animal with the <span class="tl">brush</span>, cast and blow, and beat the table to shake the <span class="tl">mold</span> and do as with the others. Do not forget to put in <span class="m">crocum</span>, because it prevents <span class="tl">molds</span> from cracking, and it is appropriate for all <span class="m">metals</span>.

## <span class="m">Silver</span> used to cast

 
It is not pure but alloyed <span class="m">silver</span>, and it does not become perfectly white on the fire because they <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> whiten it after the melting to clean up the welding marks that occur when an animal needs to be attached to another or when it needs repairing. The process is similar with teston <span class="m">silver</span> and all alloyed <span class="m">silver</span> as long as it is soft and good.
 
Before starting to cast in <span class="m">silver</span>, in order to coat all round and strengthen your <span class="tl">mold</span>s, you should use <span class="m">earth</span> that can withstand fire, such as this sandy <span class="m">earth</span> mixed with <span class="m">cloth waste</span> which <span class="pro">founders</span> use to cast their canons, or any good <span class="m">lute</span> that can withstand fire. They need to all be red and to be tied with <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> wire</span>.
 
Rather than anneal the <span class="tl">mold</span>s, have the mixture necessary so that the <span class="m">silver</span> runs.
 
If <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> knew the material to make <span class="m">silver</span> run in their work, they would buy it in quantity. Some buy it five sols for a denier.

>   Before luting and strengthening the <span class="tl">mold</span>s for <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span> with the said <span class="m">earth</span>, the cast and the vents must be made and the <span class="tl">mold</span>s must have been annealed and made quite red to burn the animals, flowers and herbs that are inside. The ashes in the <span class="tl">mold</span>s should be cleaned thoroughly. Once the <span class="tl">mold</span>s are quite clean and ready, lute them and bind them with <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> wire</span>. Anneal them straight away until they are quite red.
