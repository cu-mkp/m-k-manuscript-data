##  How to make <span class="m">argento</span> run 

 
Take white <span class="m">arsenic</span>, two <span class="ms">ounces</span>, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Orpiment</span> or <span class="m">yellow arsenic</span>, two <span class="ms">ounces</span>, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Aes ustum</span>, two <span class="ms">ounces</span>, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Fine copper filings</span> moderately well ground, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Antimony</span>, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Rock salt</span>, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> Raw <span class="m">Tartar</span>, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Sandever</span>, 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Saltpeter</span>, the half amount, namely 1 <span class="ms">℥</span> Course common <span class="m">salt</span>, melted, the half amount, 1 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Sublimate</span>, the half amount, 1 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Borax</span>, the half amount, 1 <span class="ms">℥</span> <span class="m">Sal ammoniac</span>, same quantity as <span class="m">borax</span>, 1 <span class="ms">℥</span>
 
Take these ingredients, the best ones you can find. Weigh them as described above, and crush them separately, keeping your face covered, over the nose & the mouth, from the eyes down, in order to avoid the exhalations of <span class="m">arsenic</span>, <span class="m">sublimate</span>, and <span class="m">orpiment</span>. Mix them well all together, then put them in a good crucible that must be so large that the ingredients can have at least the fourth or fifth part empty. Cover the crucible with a good tile, precisely adapted in its roundness so as to fit the opening. And having connected it tightly with wire from top to bottom and around the sides, lute it with <span class="m">manure</span> or <span class="m">founder’s earth</span>,that <span class="pro">artillery founders</span> use. And in this, be careful & diligent, & do not forget to mix in <span class="m">crushed glass</span> throughout the lute to fortify your crucible, in a way that it takes no air, for the mixture would be worth scarcely anything, because the <span class="del">4</span> <span class="add">five</span> last ingredients would be exhaled.

>   Lute well your <span class="tl">crucible</span>, so that it does not break, for if it breaks, the materials evaporate & the fumes from it are dangerous. If within 12 hours it has not melted and intermingled, it will not be well made.

>   <span class="pro">Goldsmiths</span> who know about these things sell a <span class="ms">denier</span> of this for 5 <span class="cn">sols</span> to other <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span>, & especially to those who make dishware and great works, for at the end of their works, they can solder over the first solder by the means of this mixture, in general all those who want to mold and cast something delicate. This mixture should not be divulged, so that it is not abused.
