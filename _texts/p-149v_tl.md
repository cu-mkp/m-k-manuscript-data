## Molding vases in several pieces

 
<span class="pro">Goldsmiths</span> who make large works and crockery use a turning lathe to get the model they wish in wood. Then with some <span class="m">wax</span>, <span class="sup"><span class="pro">the goldsmiths</span></span>model on top of this the masks, festoons, or anything that they wish. Then they mould the model in three, four, or several pieces.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gold</span> solder

 
They take on a <span class="m">gold</span> penny a small pinch of refined <span class="m">aloc</span>, as you would find in old sous. 
 
 
  

## Molding <span class="al">flies</span>

 
Large <span class="al">flies</span> can be molded & cast. But you must apply underneath their wings some <span class="m">wheat oil</span>, which dries quickly and firms them up & gives them a little thickness. The same thing can be done with <span class="al">butterflies</span>, <span class="al">cicadas</span>, <span class="al">grasshoppers</span> & similar things. But to cast them more easily, you must set them on some leaf or bouquet. The others should be placed by hand on a very slender <span class="m">silver</span> blade. You cannot keep your insects when they are dead, since they will dry out and their legs will break.

>  <span class="m">Wheat oil</span> should be put underneath delicate things to make them more rigid & firm, & to make them hold their natural posture, since being weak & delicate, the tempered sand, adding weight to them, would change their form.

 
  

## <span class="al">Bats</span>

 
They have very thin wings and if they are large & dry and the wings are extended, you need a very big mold & it is not certain that the <span class="m">metal</span> will run sufficiently; thus, when you want to mold some, choose the medium—sized ones & and arrange them so that they have their wings are half folded, since in this way they will come out better. But be sure to apply, as you known, some <span class="m">wax</span> on the side of the wings, so that the cast flows well.
