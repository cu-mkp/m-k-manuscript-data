## <span class="tl">Casting</span> <span class="al">snake</span>s in all <span class="tmp">season</span>s

 
<span class="al">Snake</span>s hide underground during <span class="tmp">winter</span>. Some people feed them a lot in <span class="tl">barrel</span>s filled with <span class="m">earth</span> and covered with <span class="m">manure</span>. Other people make several <span class="tl">mold</span>s in <span class="tmp">summer</span> because you can make four or five <span class="tl">mold</span>s with one single <span class="al">snake</span>. Other people <span class="tl">cast</span> long, natural <span class="al">snakes</span> without coils, using <span class="m">common plaster</span>, annealed as said, with a core and two half—molds. Then they cast it in <span class="m">wax</span>, that way they have a <span class="al">snake</span> as twisted as they want. Then they cast <span class="m">metal</span> as it is said.

## <span class="m">Tin</span> and <span class="m">lead</span> mixture

 
For fine <span class="pa">herb</span>s, <span class="pa">flower</span>s and <span class="pa">greeneries</span>. You need more than 3 parts of <span class="m">tin</span> for one part of <span class="m">lead</span>. If this material is thick and fat, you need 3 parts <span class="m">lead</span>. Heat the mostly <span class="m">tin</span> mixture, which must become red and very hot. When you want to <span class="tl">cast</span>, remove your <span class="tl">crucible</span> from the fire, and add two or three grains of <span class="m">resin</span> for one and a half or two <span class="ms">pound</span>s of <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>. With the <span class="m">resin</span>, also some fat <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span>, the size of an auclane with its shell, mix and cast. Make sure you have more <span class="m">metal</span> than you need; some <span class="m">metal</span> should be set aside. If you haven't enough <span class="m">metal</span>, keep <span class="tl">cast</span>ing and finish your <span class="tl">cast</span>, it will set, however it will not be so neat. Dip your <span class="tl">mold</span> into <span class="m">water</span>, and dismantle your <span class="tl">mold</span> carefully with a <span class="tl">point</span>. Make an elongated <span class="tl">cast</span> in order not to damage anything. If you <span class="tl">mold</span> something very thin, you must make your <span class="tl">cast</span> with mostly <span class="m">tin</span>.

>   If you want to <span class="tl">cast</span> <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> as a core with the sand above mentioned, reheat your <span class="tl">mold</span> once only if there is nothing to be burnt inside. But if there are <span class="pa">flower</span>s or <span class="al">animal</span>s to be burnt inside the <span class="tl">mold</span>, reheat it twice. However do not reheat the second <span class="tl">cast</span> for as long as the first <span class="tl">cast</span> for <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>. As for <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>, those must be red when you <span class="tl">cast</span>. For <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>, let them cool down until you can dip your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> into the <span class="tl">cast</span> without burning yourself. The <span class="tl">cast</span> must be warm.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Copper</span> and <span class="m">tin</span> <span class="tl">cast</span>s

 
For <span class="m">red copper</span> you must add <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>. It will clean it and remove the crust when melted. Some people add big pieces of <span class="m">new leather</span>. Other add peels of <span class="m"><span class="al">mice</span> feet</span>. Other add melted <span class="m">common salt</span> only, or <span class="m">salt</span> melted with <span class="m">saltpeter</span>. The main ingredients are <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> and also a little bit of <span class="m">tin</span>, depending on the <span class="tl">cast</span> you want to do. <span class="m">Copper</span> is harder to <span class="tl">cast</span> than <span class="m">tin</span>. But when it is melted it runs better, even if alloyed with <span class="m">tin</span>. Add a quarter of <span class="m">copper</span> to <span class="m">tin</span> and mix it like <span class="m">copper</span>. <span class="m">Calamine</span> especially makes it run well.
