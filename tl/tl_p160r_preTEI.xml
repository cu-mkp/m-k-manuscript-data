<ab>It is made of two sheets of iron, fasten with four small iron
pillars, in such a way that the upper sheet is able to move and run
freely along the pillars, while the lower one is fixed. A St André
cross, made of iron, stops at the end of the pillars; there is a screw
in the middle of the cross, which squeezes the sheets against the molds
placed between them.

For small molds, we make a frame; having put the mold between two metal
sheets, we squeeze it in the frame with for small moulds, put the mould
between two iron sheets, and squeeze it with wedges.

Big wooden presses, with a screw, apart from being heavy to move to the
furnace for casting, make it difficult to see when they squeeze too
much, and they often break the molds.</ab>

<ab>The screw is fixed to these nuts which are nailed down the upper
plate, this way it raises and presses the mould.</ab>

<ab>In casting with thick <m>sand</m>, <m>flowers</m> crumple; it
squeezes them into a mass. For this reason, be sure to dilute your
<m>sand</m> very thinly, and blow on it so the <m>flowers</m> are not
entirely covered. When you dilute your <m>sand</m>, do not only stir it
with the small shovel, but beat it as you would <m>egg white.</m></ab>
