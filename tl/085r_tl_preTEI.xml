<ab>and place it on a flat &amp; well-clean table, &amp; since it has a desiccative quality, I knew it would dry out.  I left it to dry for a while to reduce it to a powder &amp; mold it with <m>sand</m>, it having been ground into small pieces with my fingers &amp; the sharp side of a knife.  I <m>oil</m>ed my medal because <m>oil</m> cleans it without damaging it. And after cleaning &amp; drying the medal with a <m>cloth</m> &amp; small bristle brush of <m>pork skin</m>, I lightly <m>oil</m>ed it once more with clear <m>walnut oil</m>, &amp; gently swiped it with a <m>cloth</m> so that [the medal] would not be too <m>oil</m>ed; having already considered that in this way [the medal] should come out easily, because the <m>white lead,</m> wet with <m>glair</m>, which would not damage the <m>oil</m>. This worked very well.  I molded a medal very cleanly in high relief, without it having any lumps, which a lot of good <m>sands</m> such as <m>felt</m>, burnt <m>bone</m>, &amp; <m>iron dross</m> failed to do on the first attempt. I re-cooked it &amp; my mold became hard like marble. And then I knew that <m>sands</m> used to mold big relief must be very moist with some kind of <m>water</m>, which gives body &amp; firmness, like <m>egg white</m>, <m>gummed water</m>, [or] one [<m>water</m>] boiled with <m>elm root</m>. And lightly <m>oil</m> your medal. It can take as many firings as you want because it is as hard as glass.  But soft <m>lead</m> &amp; sour <m>tin</m> must be cast at a very hot temperature.</ab>


<ab>Since that moment, I have realized that even though this <m>sand</m> is excellent &amp; can be cast often &amp; molds very neatly, it is fat and it makes bubbles. In this way, the <m>soft lead</m> does not suit the mold well.  But I have tried to mix it with lean <m>sand</m>, such as <m>pumice</m>, <m>metal scrapings</m>, &amp; similar things, in order to give it body, &amp; to help it come off easily, because lean <m>sand</m> [alone] does not come off easily; and yet it takes <m>metal</m> well.</ab>

Try to mix <m>white lead</m> or <m>minium</m> with other sands.</ab>

Oil &amp; smear with <m>aspic oil</m>, which will disappear when reheated, because the <m>oil</m> causes bubbling.</ab>

It is necessary to mold with <m>egg white</m>, and then mix it well. And once it is in the box mold, beat it well on the top with a pestle, or something else clean. This helps to make molding better and come out more easily.</ab>

It is best to fill the box mold in one go, because the mixture made of several <m>sands</m>, and the one from mines, that you use to fill the box mold, damages it.</ab>

<ab>After casting them neatly, cover them with <m>glass salts</m>, which we use for sand, &amp; moisten it.  &amp; Within three or four days they will be green. Oil them after, &amp; place them under some <m>manure</m>.</ab>
