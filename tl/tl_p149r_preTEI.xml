<head>Softening <m>iron</m> and making it really soft</head>

<ab>Take some <m>sublimate</m>, some <m>quicklime</m>, <m>soap from
Venice</m>, some <m>horse manure</m>, use less <m>sublimate</m> than the
other ingredients. Moisten all of them together, forming a paste and
apply this to the <m>iron</m>, and wrap the whole thing in a dirty rag.
Then reheat it until it becomes very red. Or leave it overnight in a
good fire until the morning. It will be very soft and you will be able
to engrave whatever you wish on it.</ab></div>

<head>Gold of lesser quality from <pl>Germany</pl>,
<m>Electre</m></head>

<ab>One calls it <m>gold</m> from the <pl>Rhine</pl>, which you can find
in the rivers, and it comes in gold flakes. <pl>German</pl>
<pro>goldsmiths</pro> wanted to refine it, thinking that they could
separate it from the whitenes, which they thought was <m>silver</m>. But
it always stayed white, which proves that this whiteness is fixed and
it's only fault lies in its color. This is <m>electre</m>, from which
you can make cups, which will reveal poison.</ab></div>

<head>Various arts from <pl>Germany</pl></head>

<ab>They make great use of water mills, and most of these artisans
working with <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, and any other metal, bring
their large works to the mills to be hammered. And to pull <m>iron
thread</m>, they heat large amounts of <m>iron</m>, making it into a
point, they hang it up still red, and very quickly pull it.</ab></div>

<head>Repairing medals</head>

<ab>If you want to mold any medal to use as a model, and at the same
time repair it, cast it in a greater quantity of <m>tin</m>, and put in
it a good amount of <m>tin alloy</m> to make it harder.</ab></div>
