<ab>To dry preserves <del>take a</del> which are not liquid, take an
open tub pierced on both sides with a small, square window, &amp; pass
sticks through these on one side and the other, &amp; place on these a
sieve made of strings in the form of a net. And on this, you will
readily place the vessels with your preserves. And having put at the
bottom of the tub a chafing-dish or two, cover the tub with a sheet
folded double.</ab>
