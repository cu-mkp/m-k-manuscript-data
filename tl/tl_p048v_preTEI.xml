<head>Regulus extracts</head>

<ab>Take one pound of <m>antimony</m>, half a pound of <m>black
soap,</m> and half a pound of <m>Montpellier tartar</m>. Once it is all
pulverized, you have to boil it in a <m>varnished earthenware pot</m> on
a big <m>fire</m> as you stir it with a <m>piece of wood or iron</m>.
The <m>soap</m> will burn off and be consumed by the <m>fire</m> and the
rest will stay red. The quantity has to be reduced to a third. Then
throw that on a <m>tile</m> and it will turn blackish. You will have to
melt and pour that on a <m>tile</m> four or five times and then you will
have <m>regulin from antimony</m>.</ab>

<ab>Others pulverise the <m>antimony</m> and mix it with equal
quantities of <m>saltpeter</m> and powdered <m>tartar</m> and heat a
<m>pot</m> or <m>crucible</m> until it is red hot, then add a little bit
at a time, turning their back for fear of the smoke, and keep doing so
until everything is added. They maintain the <m>fire</m> until
everything is completely melted and melt that several times.</ab>

<head><m>Lead</m>, <m>tin</m></head>

<ab>They become brittle having been put back to melt, often or for a
long time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one
melts a <fr>saulmon</fr>, the <m>tin</m> thickens at the bottom if,
while casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to
melt a little <m>lead</m> <del>&amp; the</del> or <m>tin</m> &amp;
<del><fr>remuer</fr></del> to renew at each melting. The <m>antimony</m>
renders them breakable. The <m>looking glass tin</m> whitens them.
<del>One</del> <pro>Pewterers</pro> put in <del>on the <m>fine
tin</m></del> one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking glass tin</m> per one
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> &amp; two <ms>lb</ms> &amp; a half
or three <ms>lb</ms> of <m>red &amp; soft copper of cauldrons</m>, which
is better than <m>latten.</m> There is <m>fine &amp; soft tin</m> &amp;
<m>brittle tin</m>. The brittle one is cast in <tl><fr>grille</fr></tl>
by the <pro>pewterers</pro> to sell it better. <del><fr>O</fr></del>
They come out better &amp; more neatly in <tl><m>stone</m> moulds</tl>
than in a <tl><m>copper</m> mold</tl>, because <m>copper</m> is fat
&amp; sticks unless one heats the <tl>mold</tl> well or one casts large
works. Three <ms>quarters</ms> of <m>lead</m> per one <ms>lb</ms> of
<m>soft tin</m>, makes a very liquid line &amp; proper for casting,
which has a shine like a mirror. <m>Tallow for glass</m> lightens them.
All things that lightens well <m>metals</m> &amp; remove their thickness
&amp; dense nature &amp; render them <del>like</del> liquid like
<m>water</m>, render them proper for casting, for it is the thickness
that prevents them from running. <m>Soft tin</m> is more even
<del><fr>com</fr></del> than the <m>brittle one</m>, which is whiter and
seems to be burnished like a mirror.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
To alloy well <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>lead</m>, one needs to melt one by
itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it
often on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl> or the <tl><m>square tile</m></tl>.
And when you will see it become well even <del>like</del> &amp; shiny as
if it were burnished, it is good. Because sometimes it becomes spotted
due to too much <m>lead</m> &amp; sometimes due to too much <m>tin</m>.
There is some <m>tin</m> that has more <m>lead</m> than others.
<m>Common tin</m> is the one that is mixed with <m>lead</m>.</ab>
