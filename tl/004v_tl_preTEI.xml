<head>Black varnish for sword guards, <sup><m>metal</m></sup> bands for chests, etc.</head>
 
<ab>Take <m><pa>linseed</pa> oil</m> or, for a cheaper option, <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>, and rid it of fat with <m><pa>garlic</pa> cloves</m> and <m><pa>hog's fennel</pa></m> (some also add <m>bread crusts</m>), which you will boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Then add to one pound of the <m>oil</m> boiled in this way a piece of <m>black pitch</m> the size of a walnut and a <ms>double handful</ms> of <m><pa>wheat</pa></m>, without removing the <m><pa>garlic</pa></m> and <m><pa>onions</pa></m>, and allow to boil together for a good quarter of an hour. Once the <m>pitch</m> is well melted and the <m>oil</m> takes on body, you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your <m>iron</m> over a warm <m>charcoal</m> fire and apply with a <tl>feather</tl> or a <tl>brush</tl>. When you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish is dry.</ab>

For an excellent black varnish, add two or three <m>paternoster beads</m> to the rest.</ab>

Some consider <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> to be better.</ab>

If there is a quantity of varnish, it needs to boil for at least half a day, because the more it boils, the better it is. Should the varnish boil over, it is dangerous for it to catch fire and it is difficult to extinguish. So do this in a <env>courtyard</env> or other <env>open space</env>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
In five or six lbs. of <m>oil</m>, one must put one lb. of <m>galipot</m>, which costs 4 sols, and some peeled <m><pa>garlic</pa> cloves</m>. This varnish is not black in and of itself, but turns black when exposed to fire.</ab>

<head>Black varnish without fire, without disassembling harnesses or removing <sup><m>metal</m></sup> bands from chests.</head>


<ab>Take <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> varnish and mix it with <m>charcoal black</m> or <m>lampblack</m> and, without fire, it will mix in by itself. Apply the varnish with a brush and it will soon be dry. <m>Turpentine</m> varnish would work quite well but it does not dry as quickly.</ab>

<head><pro>Iron engravers'</pro> varnish.</head>


<ab>Take <m><pa>linseed</pa> oil</m> or <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> and instead of <m>black pitch</m> you will add some <m>pine resin</m> and you must cook it like <m>black varnish</m> on fire. And to apply it, heat your <m>iron</m> and apply just one layer of varnish, and when it no longer smokes, it is dry. Then engrave with a <tl><m>steel</m> point</tl> whatever you want. Then take some <m>salt</m> and <m>verdigris</m> and soak it with as much of one as of the other in very strong <m>vinegar</m>, and leave it for XX4 hours before using it, and the whole will be soaked. Then spread this liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a <tl>sponge</tl></ab>
