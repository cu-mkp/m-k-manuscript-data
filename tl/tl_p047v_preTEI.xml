<ab>Take <m>tartar</m> from large vessels, dilute it in <m>water</m>,
and it will taste like wine.</ab>

<head>Melting</head>

<ab>Some, to make it run neatly, put <ms>half</ms> <m>metal</m> &amp;
<ms>half</ms> <m>copper</m>. Others take one <ms>part</ms> of
<m>potin</m> &amp; one <ms>part</ms> of <del><m>copper</m></del>
<m>latten</m>. Others take one <ms>part</ms> of <m>candlesticks
latten</m> &amp; one <ms>part</ms> of <m>basin latten</m>. And among
basins, the <m>latten</m> of larger ones is more brittle than that of
skillets, because in order to make the round shape so small it is
necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, that have a more
ample round shape, the substance can be more brittle. In any event, the
most brittle <m>latten</m> runs better, &amp; casts more neatly, but it
must be cast very <del>neat</del> hot. <del>One</del> When one wants to
cast, one casts <m>lead</m> into the substance, which makes it flow
&amp; run &amp; goes up in smoke, &amp; keeps the <tl>mold</tl> from
corrupting. And if you want to cast <fr>pieces de foeu</fr>, mix in more
<m>rosette</m> than <m>latten</m>, so that it is less breakable. The
<tl>crucibles for melting <m>metal</m></tl> should be better than
<tl>those for <pro>glassmakers</pro></tl> for <m>glass</m> is not as
heavy as <m>metal</m>. And in this instance, one needs to lute the
<tl>crucibles</tl> with <m>earth</m> and <m>crushed glass</m>.</ab>

<ab>Those made <tmp>in winter</tmp> &amp; <env><tmp>humid

<head>Cast</head>

<ab>Finely <m>calcinated pumice stone</m> casts 22 <ms>carat</ms>
<m>gold</m> without repair, but it needs to be ablaze and red like the
<m>metal</m>. And it withstands several casts.</ab>
