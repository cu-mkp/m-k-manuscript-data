<ab>If they are not <fr>trempées à pacquet</fr>, that is, in the manner
described, with <m>soot</m>, <m>salt</m>, &amp; <m>vinegar</m>, they
will not be good. The large <tl>square files</tl> used by
<pro>locksmiths</pro> to draft their work are only made of <m><fr>fer
doulx</fr></m>, But the <tl>soft files</tl> should be made of
<m>steel</m>. <pro>Founders</pro> whose work is to repair <m>latten</m>
&amp; <m>copper</m> should have their files coarse otherwise they fill
up with <m>copper</m> which makes them smooth &amp; soon renders them
useless. <m>Latten</m>, which is more brittle, welcomes softer files
than <m>copper</m> does.</ab>

<ab>Once having been burned well twice &amp; pulverized, they mold very
neatly in sand &amp; need not be reheated, but simply heated with the
flame of <m>straw</m>. But if you mold them in a <fr>noyau</fr>, give it
its first layer, simple &amp; very thin, with a
<tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>, &amp; leave to dry at ease. Next fortify the
following layers with <m>wadding</m> mixed with the said tempered
<m>bone sand</m>.</ab>

It is the neatest sand that can be found for <m>copper</m>.</ab>

<ab><m><add><pa>Walnut</pa></add> oil</m> mixed with as much of
<m>turpentine</m> &amp; distilled by an <tl>alembic</tl> renders an
essence whiter than <m>common water</m>. But this has no body &amp; does
not give a bond for colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
the color without stickiness and faded. These, imbibed in this way,
would not let you work or soften, no more than in <m>distemper</m>. But
you rectify this fault, by giving it a little body with
<m>turpentine</m>, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
work with <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m> &amp; will make a perfect
<m>lead white</m>. <m>Turpentine varnish</m> made with this <m>oil</m>
is dry in one <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms>.</ab>
