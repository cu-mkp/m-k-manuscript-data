<ab>and with your pipes and abrevouers @, you can also place small
threads of <m>wax</m> which are applied to the body so that the
<m>metal</m> goes more easily from one part to another and runs quickly
throughout. And with these pipes, you can guide

your cast and your vents without having ruined anything.</ab>

small rolls, you make your casts and vents without danger of chipping or
<x>...</x> any of the mold because the <m>wax</m>, once it has been
removed, leaves a thoroughly empty place. Make your vents proceed from
the head <x>of the cast</x>, which is at the bottom, towards the cast.
Make your cast so that it is not thick, and make two or three notches
inside the passage because this impairs the <m>metal</m> fury. And it
makes it flow easily without filling with bubbles, <x>and</x> it does
not make too much smoke which dams up the passage. You can also divide
it into two or three branches thusly

<head><m>Plaster</m></head>

<ab>When you mold something in order to cast with <m>wax</m>, first mold
only <m>plaster</m>, you mold with <m>plaster</m> <x>that is</x> only
reheated after <x>it</x> has been pulverized. Because, once <x>it</x>
has been reheated on the <m>stone</m> slab, the outside is burnt, and
the inside remains nearly unburnt. Transparent grey <m>plaster</m> is
not strong, but the good one <x><m>plaster</m></x> becomes white once it
has been soaked, and <x>it</x> sets well quickly. Nevertheless I have
found the grey <x><m>plaster</m></x> to be quite firm and hard after it
has set, but it takes longer <x>to work with it</x>. Know the nature of
each. You will never mold very neatly if you do not soak until it is
quite clear and liquid, your <m>plaster</m> or the core's <m>sand</m>.
Soak it straight away after it has been reheated.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
However, if you mold with <m>plaster</m> that has been reheated once as
said, coat the first mold well with <m>oil</m>. And when the second cast
has set and you have prepared it, soak it in <m>water</m> for a long
time. And if it does not release, soak it in hot <m>water</m>, because
cold <m>water</m> hardens it.</ab>

<ab><x>Something</x> to know</ab>

<ab>And hot <m>water</m> softens it <x><m>plaster</m></x> more than cold
<m>water</m> <x>which</x> does not penetrate it <x><m>plaster</m></x> as
<x>it does</x> <m>mixed</m> <m>plaster</m> because it
<x><m>plaster</m></x> is stronger and <m>mixed plaster</m> is spongier.
<m>Medal</m>s are cast from this <m>powder</m>ed, reheated
<m>plaster</m>, <x>and the <m>medal</m>s</x> will be waterproof as
though they were <m>varnish</m>ed. In Germany, people hang these
<m>medal</m>s on houses. See to it that the <m>water</m> is very hot,
and if the <m>water</m> is boiling, it will not endanger <x>it</x>. All
molds <x>made</x> of plaster only or molds <x>made of</x> <m>mixed</m>
<m>plaster</m> are stripped from it.</ab>

<head>Scimitars</head>

<ab><pro>Workers</pro> from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to the
Turks, separate <m>iron</m> from the <m>mine</m>s with <m>steel</m>. And
they cast the blades of the scimitar in <m>sand</m> with this first
<m>steel</m> <x>that was</x> first casted from its <m>mine</m>.
Afterwards, they <x>the blades</x> cut other <m>iron</m> without without
great difficulty because all melted <m>iron</m> is harder than soft
<m>iron</m> beaten into <x>...</x> and bars. Thus is the <m>steel</m> of
scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When someone takes the haft of a
scimitar off, that person recognizes <x>it</x> well by the tip in the
haft which is cast in <m>sand</m>.</ab>

<ab>Make a small hole into the ground, put your ear against it during
the night or during an equally quiet time, and you will easily hear the
