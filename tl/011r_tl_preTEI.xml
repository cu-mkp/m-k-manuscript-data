<head>Painting <m>esmail d’azur</m>in <m>oil</m></head>


<ab>This is a secret that is hardly known to common <pro>painters</pro>. Some take the most delicate they can &amp; crush it with <m>ceruse</m>, which binds it, and next prick with an awl in several places the area they want to paint with <m>azur d’esmail</m>, such that the <m>oil</m> enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; <add><fr>ne</fr></add> does not cause the <m>azure</m>, which in itself is heavy, to run at all. Others lay the panel flat &amp; put down the <m>azure</m> on it, which is also done <fr>à destrempe</fr>. The main thing is to crush it well on <m><tl>marble</tl></m>, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it <del>with</del> thoroughly with an <m>egg yolk</m> &amp; then wash it in five or six lots of water and lay it on not with a  <tl><fr>painceau</fr></tl>, which would be too soft, but with a <tl><fr>broisse</fr></tl> thoroughly softened &amp; crimped, &amp; laying it on thickly as if one were putting it down with a <tl>trowel</tl>; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that crushing <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m> with <m>egg yolk</m> &amp; next washing it in several lots of <m>water</m> is good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the crushing of it. I have also washed it in several lots of <m>water</m> &amp;, when it had settled a little, I removed the <m>water</m>, still <del>q</del> blue, with a <tl>sponge</tl> and squeezed it into another <tl>vessel</tl> <del>thus</del> <add>where it settled, &amp; from the residue</add> I had the <m>ash</m>, flower and subtlest part of the <m>azure</m> without crushing it, which is the best, for in the crushing of it, it loses some of its tint. Those who make it in <pl>Germany</pl> compound it like <m>enamel</m>, in large pieces which they pestle, &amp; pass through several <tl>sieves</tl> &amp; wash.</ab>


<ab>To make <m>azures</m> beautiful, they wash or soak them in a <m>rock water</m>, as they call it; it is a <m>water</m> distilled from mines where <m>azure</m> or <m><fr>vert d'azur</fr></m> is found, which distills naturally through the mountain's veins or is distilled through an <tl>alembic</tl> <del><fr>par</fr> </del> from mineral stones of <m>azure</m> or <m>copper</m>.</ab>


<ab><m><add>Azure</add> ashes</m> are only good for landscapes because they die in <m>oil</m>. Only true <m>azure</m> holds on. <m>Azur d’esmail</m>cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the <bp>fingernail</bp> or the <m>oil</m> palette. If it <del>[illegible]</del> happens to be sandy, do not crush it except with the <m>egg yolk</m> or, better yet, wash it in clear <m>water</m> &amp; with a <tl>sponge</tl> remove the <m>colored water</m> after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work with.</ab>
