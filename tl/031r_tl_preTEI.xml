<ab>Their <tl>hammers</tl> must be quite even and polished, and if by some accident rust or other usage has damaged them, they polish them first with <m>stripping powder</m>, and then they finish them off by burnishing and softening with rough <m>metal</m>.  Otherwise they would not strike neatly.  It is also necessary that the plane of the <tl>anvils</tl> be level.</ab>

<head>A new vine</head>
<ab>When [the vine] has taken root well, if you want it to grow many cordons, having dug furrows [next to it], put two handfuls of <m>pigeon guano</m> next to each rootstock.</ab>

<head>Colored water</head>
<ab>Distilled <m>urine</m>, <m>distilled vinegar</m> and <m>eau-de-vie</m> take on a blue and green color from powdered and finely ground <m>burnt bronze</m>. And the residue from this tincture will be <m>red copper</m> if you distill the things indicated with a filter.</ab>

<head>Water-resistant varnish</head>
<ab><pl>Flanders</pl> varnish made with <m>turpentine</m> and its <m><sup>turpentine</sup> oil</m>, or with <m>mastic <sup>oil</sup></m>, can be taken off and doesn't subsist in the rain.  But that made with <m>white nut oil</m>, as you do it, holds in the rain and is very clear and fine and dries quickly.  This is why one uses it for painted standards and signs that one carries into the rain.</ab>

<head>Fruit from <m>sugar</m></head>
 <ab>Don't paint them with a <tl>brush</tl> like other color-moistened things, for the <m>sugar</m> would melt. But rub them with color with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>.</ab>
