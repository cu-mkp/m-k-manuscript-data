<ab>Their <tl>hammers</tl> must be quite even &amp; polished, and if in some unfortunate case the rust, <del>the</del> or some other use, has damaged them, they first polish them with <m>emery stone powder</m>, then they finish burnishing &amp; smoothing with the <m>putty</m>.  Otherwise they would not strike neatly. It is also necessary that the face of the <tl>anvils</tl> be the same.</ab>

<head>A new vine</head>
<ab>When [the vine] has taken root well, if you want it to grow many cordons, having dug furrows [next to it], put two handfuls of <m>pigeon guano</m> next to each rootstock.</ab>

<head>Colored water</head>
<ab>Distilled <m>urine</m>, <m>distilled vinegar</m> and <m>eau-de-vie</m> take on a blue and green color from powdered and finely ground <m>burnt bronze</m>. And the residue from this tincture will be <m>red copper</m> if you distill the things indicated with a filter.</ab>

<ab><m><pl>Flanders</pl> varnish</m>, made with <m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m>oil</m> from this or from <m>mastic</m>, can come off and does not hold up <env>in the rain</env>. But that made with <m><fr>huile de noix blanche</fr></m>, as you have done, holds <env>in the rain</env> and is very clear &amp; beautiful &amp; dries soon. This is why one uses this one for painted banners &amp; signs that one carries <env>in the rain</env>.</ab>

<head>Fruit made from <m>sugar</m></head>
 <ab>One does not paint them with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> like other <del>s</del> things with moistened color, because the <m>sugar</m> would melt. But one rubs them with color with the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>.</ab>
