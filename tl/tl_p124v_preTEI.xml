<ab><m>Fine gold</m> is opposed to it, for <del><ill/></del> on it it
remains yellowish. But alloyed <m>gold</m> is more appropriate for it,
such as that of <cn>escu</cn> &amp; <cn>pistolet</cn>. <del>If</del>
<m>Gold</m> <del>f</del> <del>is not put back on the fire</del> with its
own pale color renders the <m>enamel</m> a dead colour.
<del><fr>Ma</fr></del> And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back
on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the <m>enamels</m>
beautiful. <add>Otherwise, they are matte.</add></ab>

<ab>There is <m>rouge clair</m> which, once it is used with
<m><fr>arene</fr></m>, loses its beauty.</ab>

<ab>Some can be found that have <m>grains of gold</m> inside, and it is
also the opinion of good <pro>goldsmiths</pro> that the good one is made
with <m>gold</m>.</ab>

<head>Casting with <m>gold</m></head>

<ab>Molds are reheated better &amp; more surely in a closed fire, such
as <del><tl>pot</tl></del> in a <tl>reverberatory furnace</tl>. So that
when goldsmiths want to cast some important piece <del>d’<m>or</m>
e</del> that cost a lot to rough out in wax, they put the <tl>molds</tl>
in a <tl>pot</tl> &amp; cover them, &amp; fill the pot with earth,
sustaining the fire that holds them together &amp; tight. Then, they
reheat the <tl>mold</tl>, <m>earth</m> &amp; <tl>pot</tl> together, and
when everything is well red, they cast the <m>gold</m>. Fine <m>gold</m>
does not run well, but alloyed <m>gold does well</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> do not sour, having been, once
entirely red and hot, dipped in <m>water</m>.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-middle</margin>

<m>Gold</m> is a quarter heavier than <m>lead</m>.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-middle</margin>

When <m>gold</m> reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
<m>emerald</m>.</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Take care that where you want to cast the <m>gold</m>, there has been no
fall of <m>lead</m>, <m>tin</m>, or <m>lime</m> thereof in the
<fr>forge</fr>.</ab>

<head>Way to make the gate for small female <al>lizards</al></head>

<ab>Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is
so delicate and thin that the <del>casting will find it hard</del> metal
would run with difficulty, especially when it is curled, roll <m>wax</m>
in little threads of this size

and apply some with the hot <m>iron wire</m>, as said, one at the end of
the tail &amp; the others, that are applied in the same way, from one
<del>edge</del> <add>side</add> of the tail to the other, as you see
depicted. But take heed to make sure, that with the end of the <tl>hot
iron wire</tl>, the end of the wax barely touches the animal, for the
sand of the second cast will not touch this part. But make sure that the
end of the <m>wax</m> arranges itself only at the edge of the empty part
of the first mold. Make also conduits of <m>wax</m> around the legs
&amp;, around the contours of the body, which are a little long &amp;
they will serve as <fr>abreuvoirs</fr> for the molded thing.<cont/></ab>

When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate, comes out well,
the rest will also come out well.</ab>

The principal thing is that the ears of the <al>snake</al> come out
well-molded.</ab>

Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal &amp; of the
thickness of a knife.</ab>
