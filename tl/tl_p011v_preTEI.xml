<head>Color of <m><pl>damascene</pl> steel</m> on <tl>knives</tl></head>

<ab>Rub the <m>steel</m> with <m>common aquafortis</m>, mixing the said
<m>water</m> with <m>earth</m> <gap/> &amp; next rub the whole with
<m>ashes</m> or <m>sand</m>. &amp; the <m>gold</m>will touch &amp; the
<m>silver</m> as on a <tl><m>touchstone</m></tl>.</ab></div>

<head>For getting rid of the redness of <bp>eyes</bp> or bruising</head>

<ab>Make two small thin slices of <m>raw <al>mutton</al> flesh</m>,

<head>For coating with <m><fr>or mat</fr></m></head>

<ab>There is nothing better than the black varnish of
<pro>sword-makers</pro> to make a ground layer because it dries
immediately &amp; makes the <m>gold</m> appear very beautiful.</ab>

<head>For <tl><m>diamond</m> points</tl> for engraving</head>

<ab>These are for tracing what you want to draw on <m>stones</m> &amp;
engrave, &amp; when these <tl>points</tl> are fatty &amp; cannot bite,
one needs to rub them <m>diamond</m> against <m>diamond</m>. One rubs
them with <del>diamond</del> <tl><m>pumice stone powder</m></tl>. One
needs also to unpolish on a <tl><m>lead</m> wheel</tl> either the
<m>stone</m> or the <m>glass</m> on which you want to engrave, for the
polish, which is like <m>varnish</m> on <m>glass</m>, prevents the
<m>diamond</m> or <m>sapphire</m> from biting well. <del>But</del> This
is why it does not bite easily on the <m>hoof</m>, which is polished
&amp; fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites
easily.</ab></div>

<head><tl>Polishing wheel</tl> of <m>copper</m></head>

<ab>Before polishing your <m>stone</m> on it, it is necessary to
degrease it well, rubbing it with a piece of <m>leather</m> on the flesh
side while spinning the <tl>wheel</tl>, if you have not worked on it in
a long time.</ab></div>
