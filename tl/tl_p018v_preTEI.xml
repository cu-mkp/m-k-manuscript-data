The average weights 18 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and is xii
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weighs eight or 9 pounds and
its load is six pounds of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three cannonballs
thick and the front is two. It is more appropriate against cities'
defence rather than in battery. It is however sometimes used either to
break a barricade or to support the battery after cannons have shot, in
order to prevent the assailled from rebuilding after the cannons have
played and shot. Four <al>horses</al> can carry it. It has a range of
eight or nine hundreds <ms>paces</ms> and almost as many as the
bastarde.</ab>

To cannons and big pieces we give as much <m>powder</m> as a cannonball
and a half's diameter in proportion to the <fr>escusson</fr>. For medium
pieces, such as campaign pieces, and the ones smaller, we provide them
with powder the equivalent of two cannonballs have a quantity of
<m>powder</m> equivalent to two cannonballs thick in proportion to the
<fr>passevolant</fr> and smaller ones are given three cannonballs thick
of <m>powder</m>. Usually, all pieces are loaded up to the escusson. We
load all pieces under 4 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> with the
<tl>linstock</tl>, two <tl><ms>linstock</ms>s</tl> of cannon powder or
one and a half lantern of arquebus powder. For smaller ones, we only use
one <tl><ms>linstock</ms></tl>. The pieces of one
<fr><ms>quintal</ms></fr> as loaded with a little charge.</ab>

<ab>

A battlefield piece weighs ten or twelve <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and
is ten or 12 <fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weights 6 or 7
pounds and its loaded is 4 pounds of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front is two, like all the pieces under the
mid-sized. The breech is thicker for they are in proportion longer and
also because they are more frequently used than big pieces against
houses or elsewhere. Their caliber is also small, so we give their
breech a thickness of three cannonballs. They are used to follow
immediately a camp and for the defence of cities and houses, settling
them on walls or in a tower. Three good <al>horses</al> are required to
carry it.</ab>

<ab>

The passevolant weighs 6 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and is eight or nine
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weighs two pounds, and its
load is a pound and a half of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front two. Two <al>horses</al> can carry it
because one single horse can't carry a piece. It is used for houses'
defence or to be brought amongst the infantry to break a horsemen
rank.</ab>

<ab>

A <fr>faulconneau</fr> weighs 4 <fr><ms>quintal</ms>s</fr> and is 10
<fr><ms>pan</ms>s</fr> long. Its cannonball weighs a pound and a
quarter, its load is half a pound of <m>powder</m>. The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front two. To carry it, two <al>horses</al>,
altough these pieces are seldom moved since they are manly used to
defend houses. The ones which are carried over for battery or a fight,
or a siege, are culverines, medium-sized bastardes and pieces</ab>
