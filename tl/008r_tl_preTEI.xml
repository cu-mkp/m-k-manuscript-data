<ab>Heat the <m>lead</m> bullet as much as you can without melting it, and once it is hot dip it into the strongest <m>vinegar</m> that you can. And do this four or five times. Afterwards, mince some <m>lard</m> very finely and some <m>linen</m> also very delicately, mix all this together and use it as wadding, making it go into the arquebus or pistol with a little strength and very tightly. And before shooting, if possible, the bullet should be hot.</ab>
