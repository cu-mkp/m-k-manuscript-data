<ab>Color your applied <m>silver leaf</m> with some <m>terra emerita</m> and once dry, spread a handful of varnish of <m>aspic</m> and <m>sandarac</m> and it will be more beautiful than fine <m>gold</m>.</ab></div>

<ab>Prepare your underlayer of <m>starch</m> soaked in <m>water</m> and your <m>gold</m> will turn brown very well. Clear <m>starch water</m> laid down on <m>paper</m>, then dried, and so by three times, is a good base for <m>brown gold</m> on <m>paper</m> and is not thick.</ab></div>

<head><m>Dragon's blood</m></head>


<ab>Have a well chosen drop of it which shows its transparent red and put it in a <m>glass bottle</m> with enough quantity of the best <m>eau de vie</m> possible and close it diligently so it does not  get exposed to air otherwise it will be worth nothing and leave it so for a long time, because the longer it stays, the more beautiful and better it will be and it will dissolve if it is good otherwise it will become like <m>lees</m>. When you want to use some, make a small hole in the bottle stopper and pour some and close it again each time and apply it on gold. Good <m>dragon's blood</m> can be found in grands lopins like <m>cattle cake</m><add>this one has no worth if it is sophisticated</add> and broken it shows on its edges some transparent scale as light red enamel, it is also lumpy in some points like small rubies. The <m>eau de vie </m>must be very strong and plusieurs passes.</ab>

The darker <m>dragon's blood</m> is the best and the larme is the most dying one, which you can find in lapin like <m>pitch</m> and <m>big nuts</m> which look like

I put it in some ordinary <m>eau de vie</m>, adding some <m>aqua fortis</m> to give it strength. At the beginning the <m>water</m> turned slightly colored, but at the end it just looked like some tragacanth <m>gum</m> with which they sophisticate I think the <m>dragon's blood</m>.</ab>

When it is applied on <m>gold</m>, it is prone to break, this is why some apply on it some <m>turpentine oil</m>. Cold stops the <m>water</m> from pouring and taking the color off. And for that, you can hold it by the fire.</ab></div></root>
