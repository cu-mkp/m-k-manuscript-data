<head>The reach of an arquebuse</head>


<ab>The proportion of a fowling piece is: 4 king's feet long and the <m>bullet</m> weights xviii pennyweights, the expulsion vi pennyweight of <m>powder</m>, its range iiii-by-xx pans and 3 and a half feet and two thumbs and around a line, which is the Paris aulne. The medium arquebuse, which is the usual one and the easiest, admits xv pennyweight of <m>bullet</m>, v pennyweight of <m>powder</m> &amp; reaches lx paces.</ab>

<ab>They mix viii or ten pounds of <m>lead</m> for each hundredweight of <m>tin</m> in the cities that have regulated guilds. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One also uses ii. lb. of <m>estaim de glace</m> to bind it and three lb. of broken <m>brass</m>, that is, <m>copper</m> scrap that <pro>kettlemakers</pro> make.  This makes the vessel more reverberant and it is not as breakable.</ab>

<ab>To keep it from backfiring, clean your arquebuse every eight days, and rub it with <m>oil</m>, and when you draw out, wet some <m>linen</m> in <m>oil</m> &amp; put it in instead of <m>paper</m>.</ab>

<ab>To test it, soak it and apply it to <m>paper</m>, and if one or two hours later it has not died at all, it's fine and well-done.</ab>

<head>Dyes from <m>flowers</m></head>


<ab><m>Red poppies</m> that grow amongst wheat make a very beautiful columbine on white leather. The <m>boufain</m> makes a very beautiful blue. An <m>herb which grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to flax, long and broad leaves like little bugloss, which has a violet flower verging on blue and looks like the fleur de lys,</m> makes a quite beautiful turquin, better than azure.  Another <m>columbine flower of the shape and size of the bugloss flower, which has a leaf like that of the pansy</m>, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows in wheat in light earth.</ab>
