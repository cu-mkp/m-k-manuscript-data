<head><pro>Founders of small works <add>@ in <m>tin</m></add></pro></head>


<ab>They usually cast with <m>solder</m>, even the things that should not become empty, for the latter require <m>fine &amp; soft tin</m>, which however would not release, &amp; would not become empty if it was mixed or had some <m>looking glass tin</m> <del>mix</del> <add>in</add> it, just like they put in a little of it in <m>soft tin</m>. They carve their works on <m>stones of which are made the sharpening stones or files of <pro>barbers</pro></m>, which are found in <env>great flakes towards the mountains</env>, &amp; resemble <m>slate</m>. They are three colors of them: reddish, which is not as perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire <del>&amp; as</del>,one <del><fr>dard</fr></del> of the color of dark <m>slate</m>, the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they imprint it on <tl><m><fr>carton</fr></m></tl>, as thick as one <ms><bp>finger</bp></ms>, <add>to serve as a pattern</add>, then with a little <tl>compass</tl> &amp; little matching <m>iron fittings</m>, they carve their figures, having first flattened their <m>stones</m> &amp; worn down one against the other, they make their <del><fr>p</fr></del> molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins perfectly, because the <m>stones</m> render themselves even. Before casting, they rub the mould with <m>tallow</m>, which has quickly absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking <m>fine powder of quicklime</m> in a <tl><m>linen</m></tl>, they rub the mould while beating with the <tl><m>linen</m></tl> on top, then blow a little on top to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents. If the work is big and they make it in such a way as seen here, they pierce a hole in the part of the medal, that is least visible. And with a <tl>gimblet</tl> they pierce the mold on the side of the medal.

And if they want their work to stay pierced in whichever place, they drive in <tl>a piece of <m>cork</m></tl> at this place in the <tl>mold</tl>. And the <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> will not attach to it. </ab>

Make sure the <tl>pegs</tl> of your <tl>box mold</tl> enter easily so that <del>opening</del> it will easily open without shifting anything; and that your <tl>box molds</tl> fit well together; &amp; the <tl>table is very flat</tl>. </ab>

Try to carve with <m>distilled vinegar</m>.</ab>

Try <m>calcined <al>oyster</al> shells</m>; one says that they are excellent for molding.</ab>
