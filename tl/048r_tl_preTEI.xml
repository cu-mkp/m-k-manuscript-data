<head>Keeping birds and animals</head>


<ab>Take a measurement from [the part of] their body that is fleshy and more susceptible to decay, with some <m>canvas</m> that you shall cut according to their size and width. Having filled this with <m>cotton</m> and stitched it, skin them. But leave the head, neck, wings and feet of birds, and head, legs, feet and tail of animals, because those dry easily. Then use that <m>skin</m> to dress the mold made of <m>canvas</m>. Small ones can be dried in an oven or covered in <m>sel ammoniac</m> and <m>(?)</m>.</ab>
