<head>Painting on <m>crystal</m> or <m>glass</m></head>

<ab>They paint in <m>oil</m> without lines, except for the faces where
they trace the nose &amp; the mouth with black in small work, then they
make strokes &amp; and highlights in white, next they coat all with
carnation. And as for the ground, they make it with <m>azur
d’<pl>Acre</pl></m> for more beauty, or with <m>lake for a quickly-done
red</m>, or with <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m> for the most beauty. But
one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even &amp; of
one color, &amp; thus for other colors. Next they put underneath it a
<m>leaf of <m>topaz</m>, or one of <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m></m>.</ab>

<head>Infusion of <m>anthos</m> or <m>rosemary</m></head>

<ab>It is better to cook the flower in August &amp; more suited to
<m>oil</m>-making. Take as much as you want. Then put it into a bottle
very well corked, &amp; leave them to wilt in the shade for a day. Then
add the first substance of <m>wine</m> &amp; leave to settle three or
four days; &amp; express it all in another vessel and into this very
same substance of <m>wine</m>, add seven or eight infusions made out of
new flowers. Then leave the latest infusion in the sun for a month. Then
distill it through a still. Then mix two ounces of this <m>water</m>
with two or three spoons of <m>white wine</m>; but this is for the
elderly. Paul the Third used it.</ab>

<head>Cast</head>

<ab><m>Tin</m> comes out better being thin &amp; fine, rather than
thick, because being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore,
if you want to mold a thick piece in <m>tin</m>, mold it only on one
side, &amp; with a cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way
you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to <m>solder</m>
two halves together. But if you have to mold it thick, make it in the
form &amp; mold a lot of <fr>abrevouers</fr> around the figure, in this
way.
