<head>Casting in <tl>box molds</tl></head>

<ab>The same sand that was used in the reheated <fr>noyaulx</fr>,
composed of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> and <m><fr>alum de
plume</fr></m> as is said, is excellent for casting in <tl>box
molds</tl>, and I have experienced it thus: I crushed the pieces which
had come out of <tl>core molds</tl> in a <tl>mortar</tl>, dragging the
<tl>pestle</tl>, because this sand is very <fr>doulx</fr>. I did not
pass it through the <tl>sieve</tl>, because the <m><fr>alum de
plume</fr></m> mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I
ground finely upon <tl>marble</tl> what seemed to me too coarse. And
having prepared it thus, I moistened it with <m>sal ammoniac water</m>,
made of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, as much as the size of two
<ms><pa>walnuts</pa></ms>, in a bottle of <m>common water</m> the same
size as a <tl>bottle</tl> in which one boils <m>tisane</m>, or in a good
<tl>pot</tl> of <m>water</m> so that you find the <m>water</m> fairly
salty. I mixed throughout half a <ms>glass</ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>,
two <tl>silver spoonfuls</tl> of <m>spirits</m>. Having thus moistened
the sand in such a way that it took hold well, nevertheless coming apart
easily, I sprinkled my medal with <m>pulverized charcoal</m> with a
<tl>file</tl> to rid it of <m>oil</m>, and all other <m>grease</m>. It
is necessary to avoid them, for they would hinder good stripping. I blew
on my medal &amp; molded it, and the female part of the <tl>box
mold</tl> once filled, I marked &amp; made a line on the reverse &amp;
edge of the medal, &amp; on the nearby sand as well. In order that the
second <tl>box mold</tl> take the imprint thereupon to indicate the
place for making the cast, <del>once filled</del><del>the female part of
the box mold once filled</del> I uncovered the outline of the medal and
pounced the whole side with <m>pulverized charcoal</m>, and then filled
the male part with sand. <del>Once mad</del> I separated the <tl>box
mold</tl> and did not hit the corners of the medal to make it strip,
because that knocks the sand and makes it crumble. Rather I struck the
back of the <tl>box mold</tl>, retaining the obverse of the medal on the
bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not stripped thus, I would
have waited to remove it until the <tl>box mold</tl> had been dried out
over fire. I lit a row of <m>charcoals</m> between two little
<tl>trivets</tl> of <m>iron</m> in the form that you see, and put the
back &amp; reverse of <tl>box molds</tl> thereupon, &amp; the imprint on
top, <figure>

because in this way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should
crack from being too moistened, it is on the back that they take the
harshest fire, &amp; the imprint remains safe &amp; whole.</ab>

For the best, it is necessary to reheat the sand that is used in the
<fr>noyau</fr> rather than used it in the <tl>box mold</tl>, until it no
longer contracts.</ab>

Excellent sand</man>

<ab>Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, for
covering the medal.</ab>

<ab>

For medals &amp; flat things, the true heat of <m>lead</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m> is when it is melted gently.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
Note that I filled the <tl>box mold</tl> before pressing it, and did not
hit it, but rather pressed it with the strength of my <bp>hands</bp>
alone, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure your <tl>box
mold</tl> that it does not shift at all, &amp; if you put some moistened
sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
Make the gate that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the
medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part. Do
not forget the vents.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
Drying <tl>box molds</tl> is to keep them from humidity, that they no
longer smoke, once having nevertheless been very hot.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
<fr>Recuire</fr> is to redden the box mold, which is done for
<m>gold</m> and for <m>silver</m>.</ab>
