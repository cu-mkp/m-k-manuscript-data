<ab>You can make various grooved compartments &amp; on these, paint <al>fishes</al> naturally &amp; with color on simple <fr><m>carton</m></fr>  &amp; if you wish, on <m>silvered</m> and burnished <m>paper</m> to represent the scales. And next, cover them with very clear <m>lantern horn</m>. You can apply the very same to other works.</ab>

<ab> <pa>Trees</pa> need to be planted in dry weather, &amp;  a lot of earth gathered all around their feet, like a mound, so that the rain won't fill the holes &amp; drown the <pa>trees</pa>.</ab>

<head>Casting</head>


<ab>I have tried four kinds of sand for <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>: <m>chalk</m>, crushed <m>glass</m>, <m>tripoli</m> and burnt <m>linen</m>, all four are excellent. As to the <m>chalk</m>, it needs to be of the softest kind available, like the <m>Champagne chalk</m> used by <pro>painters</pro>. It releases very cleanly, needs not be dampened with <m>magistry</m> or with anything else, but is used in its natural dry state and finely pulverized. The first cast is always cleaner, however it will sustain two or three castings. Should you only cast once, keep in mind, while remaking your box mold, to take powdered <m>chalk</m> that has not yet been used, since the one previously used in the box has dried out and will not bind and hold together as well as fresh <m>chalk</m>. Crushed <m>glass</m> can be made from ordinary <m>glass sand</m>, however <m>cristallo glass</m> is more excellent, because <m>common glass</m> contains <m>saltwort</m> only, while <m>cristallo glass</m> contains both <m>salt of tartar</m> and <m>saltwort</m>. Both of them help the fusion, during which the glass is calcinated and reduced to its prime matter. In order to calcinate it perfectly, throw your pieces of <m>glass</m>, of whichever sort, among the largest possible glowing <m>coals</m>, unless some other violent heat source is available. And once the glass is red hot, throw it into <m>water</m>.</ab>

<m>Putty</m> is considered excellent for these two <m>metals</m>.</ab>
