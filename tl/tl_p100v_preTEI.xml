<ab>Take white <m>pebbles</m> that are found along rivers &amp; along
gravel banks, &amp; paths and that are somewhat transparent. If they are
perfectly transparent, &amp; it will be better. If not, use the best
&amp; whitest ones that you can find. Calcine them three or 4 times in
your <tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl> &amp; quench them in <m>water</m> or
<m>vinegar</m>. Then, take a <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of them and
pound them in a completely pure <tl><m>copper</m> mortar</tl>, &amp;
with a <tl>pestle of pure <m>copper</m></tl>, and grind them until they
become very fine &amp; soft powder; this is a sign that they have taken
enough of the substance of<m>copper</m> to give them greenness. Then in
your <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of <m>pebbles</m>, add in three
<figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of good <m>minium</m>, unadulterated by
<m>brick</m> &amp; something else, and strongly pound everything
together again in a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>. And in all of this,
add in a <ms><fr>gros</fr></ms> <add><del>pour</del>
<figure><del><ms>℥</ms></del></figure></add> of <m><fr>sel de
verre</fr></m>, &amp; some &amp; the common people put in
<m>sandever</m> that they find it among the <pro>glassmakers</pro> or
<pro>apothecaries</pro>. But <m>alkali salt</m>, as you know, is better.

In this way, the <fr>vulgaire</fr> makes <m>emeralds</m> &amp; casts
them in sand. If you do not have a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>, crush
<del><corr>avecq</corr>un mort</del> in a <tl>cauldron of pure
<m>copper</m></tl>.</ab>

The <tl>crucibles</tl>need to be reheated before putting materials in,
and need to be put in the <tl>forge</tl> or <fr><tl>four à
vent</tl></fr> instead of making &amp; increasing the fire.

A <ms><fr>gros</fr></ms> of <m>salt</m> in four
<figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of <m>pebbles</m> &amp;<m>minium</m>. When
one says: for <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure>, what is to be understood is:
an <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of body &amp; not of <m>salts</m> &amp;
<m>minium</m>.

<head>For <m>ruby</m> take <m>gold</m>in leaves</head>

<ab>Raise your <tl>stove</tl> by two <tl>tiles</tl> all around because
more heat is needed to make <m>rubies</m> than <m>emeralds</m>. And take
an <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of white, calcined <m>pebbles</m>, and
put it in a <tl><m>glass</m> mortar</tl> &amp;, having roughly pounded
it with the same kind of <tl>pestle</tl>, mix <del>un
<ms>grain</ms></del> in the weight of a <ms>grain</ms> of <m>gold</m>
leaves of the kind used by <pro>painters</pro> for gilding, &amp;
crush.</ab>

Some say that mixing the <m>gold</m> with <m>pebbles</m> and
<m>saltpeter</m> gives the color of a <pa>peach tree</pa></ab>.

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

Others say that the <m>gold</m> has to be cemented several times and
then beat into leaves.</ab>
