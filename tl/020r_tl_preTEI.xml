<head>@For making <m>millas</m></head>


<ab>You must have some <m>millet</m> soaked in order to remove the <m>chaff</m> and then clean it well. Next you must <tl>grind</tl> it again quite finely and pass through a cloth <tl>sieve</tl>. One must soak the <m>flour</m> with fresh melted <m>butter</m> and some <m>milk</m> so that it is very light, like the <m>pastry</m> to make <m>beignets</m>, and add <m>egg yolk</m> depending on the amount of <m>flour</m>, so that there are two <m>egg yolks</m> for each <m>millas</m>. Then you will put in some <m><pa>saffron</pa></m> if you want to give them a little colour.</ab> 


<ab>Afterwards you must have some <tl>mold</tl>s, which must be made from <m>terra<sup>cotta</sup></m>, in the shape of the bottom of the catholic hat, but it must be open at both ends. And then, having made a good fire, clean where you want to put your <m>millas</m> and then take your <tl>mold</tl>s and grease them very well so that the <m>pastry</m> does not stick to them when baked. Once you have done that, put your <tl>mold</tl>s in a place in the <tl>oven</tl> where you clean and sprinkle a bit of <m>flour</m> on the bottom and fill them with some of the aforementioned <m>pastry</m>. Then you will cover the said <tl>mold</tl>s, with a <tl>lid</tl> made like the <tl>mold</tl>, but it must be bigger and not open at the top. Then once done, you will put some <m>straw</m> on the said <tl>lid</tl> and a lot of hot <m>charcoal</m>, and set a fire around it, once done, you will open up one of them after a bit of time and will see when it is baked, it will be hard.</ab>

<head>@<pro>Glazier</pro></head>


<ab><m>Glass from <pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is smoother &amp; more even than <m>plate glass</m> and it is sturdier &amp; more durable. But commonly it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens because the <pro>glassmakers</pro>, having made it, put it when totally hot on <m>straw</m>, which stains it in this way. However, this is removed with varnish &amp; <m>salt</m> &amp; other <m>drugs</m> that the  <pro>glaziers</pro> put in. <m><pl>Lorraine</pl> glass</m> is sold by <fr><ms>lien</ms></fr> &amp; each <fr><ms>lien</ms></fr> is composed of three <ms>tablet</ms>s. The <ms>lien</ms> costs usually x <fr><cn>sou</cn></fr>s. The <m>plate glass</m> <del>sold in</del> is made in <pl>France</pl>, it is whiter &amp; clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from <pl>Lorraine</pl>. It is also commonly blown &amp; in that case, it is better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the shape of the frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very evenly.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>
The <m>plate glass</m> is sold by <fr><ms>paniers</ms></fr>. Every <ms><fr>panier</fr></ms> contains 24 <ms>plate</ms>s that are commonly sold at x or twelve <cn>lb</cn>.</ab>
