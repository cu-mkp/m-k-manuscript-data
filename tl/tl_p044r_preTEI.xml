<head>The reach of an arquebus</head>

<ab>The proportion of a hunting arquebus is a length of 4 king's feet
and a bullet of xviii pennyweight, a chasse of vi pennyweight of
<m>powder</m>, its range iiii-by-xx pans and 3 and a half feet and two
thumbs and a few lines, which is the Paris aulne. The medium arquebus,
which is the usual one and the easiest, has xv pennyweight of
<m>bullet</m>, v pennyweight of <m>powder</m> &amp; a range of lx
paces.</ab>

<ab>They mix viii <ms>lb</ms> <add>or ten</add> of <m>lead</m>, per
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m>tin</m> in <env>cities where they are <pro>sworn
masters</pro></env>. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One
also uses ii <ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking glass tin</m> to bind it &amp;
three <ms>lb</ms> of <m>debris</m>, that is to say the <m>copper shards
that <pro>coppersmiths</pro> make</m>. This makes the vessel more
<sn>sonorous</sn> and it is not as breakable.</ab>

This <m>tin</m> is called <m>common tin</m>.</ab>

<head>Arquebuse</head>

<ab>To keep it from backfiring, clean your arquebuse every eight days,
and rub it with <m>oil</m>, and when you draw out, wet some <m>linen</m>
in <m>oil</m> &amp; put it in instead of <m>paper</m>.</ab>

<ab>To test it, soak it &amp; apply it to <m>paper</m>, &amp; if one or
two <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> later it does not die there, it is fine
and good.</ab>

<head>Dyes from <m>flowers</m></head>

<ab><m>Red poppies</m> that grow amongst wheat make a very beautiful
columbine on white leather. The <m>boufain</m> makes a very beautiful
blue. An <m>herb which grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to
flax, long and broad leaves like little bugloss, which has a violet
flower verging on blue and looks like the fleur de lys,</m> makes a
quite beautiful turquin, better than azure. Another <m>columbine flower
of the shape and size of the bugloss flower, which has a leaf like that
of the pansy</m>, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows in wheat
in light earth.</ab>
