<ab>Take one pound of <m>antimony</m>, half a pound of <m>black soap,</m> and half a pound of <m>Montpellier tartar</m>. Once it is all pulverized, you have to boil it in a <m>varnished earthenware pot</m> on a big <m>fire</m> as you stir it with a <m>piece of wood or iron</m>. The <m>soap</m> will burn off and be consumed by the <m>fire</m> and the rest will stay red. The quantity has to be reduced to a third. Then throw that on a <m>tile</m> and it will turn blackish. You will have to melt and pour that on a <m>tile</m> four or five times and then you will have <m>regulin from antimony</m>.</ab>


<ab>Others pulverise the <m>antimony</m> and mix it with equal quantities of <m>saltpeter</m> and powdered <m>tartar</m> and heat a <m>pot</m> or <m>crucible</m> until it is red hot, then add a little bit at a time, turning their back for fear of the smoke, and keep doing so until everything is added. They maintain the <m>fire</m> until everything is completely melted and melt that several times.</ab>

<ab>They crack if they are often melted again and thicken and burn, so that even if a salmon is made, the <m>tin</m> becomes thick at the bottom if it is not stirred often during casting. It is better for casting to melt some <m>lead</m> and some <m>tin</m> and to renew it each time. The <m>antimony</m> makes them breakable, the <m>iced tin</m> makes them whiter. <pro>Pewterers</pro> mix a pound of <m>iced tin</m> with a quintal of <m>fine tin</m> and two and a half or three pounds of <m>red, mild cauldron copper</m>, which is better than <m>latten.</m> There is <m>fine and mild tin</m> and <m>sour tin</m>. <pro>Pewterers</pro> cast the sour as grills to sell it better. They go better and more cleanly in <m>stone</m> moulds than in <m>copper</m> molds because <m>copper</m> is fat and draws the <m>mild tin</m> when heated. Or when casting a large work, three quarts of <m>lead</m> with one pound of <m>mild tin</m> produces a very liquid mixture which is appropriate for casting and is as shiny as a mirror. Laxunge <m>glass</m> lightens them. All things that lighten <m>metals</m> a lot and remove their thickness and natural density and make them as liquid as water make them appropriate for casting because their thickness stops them from flowing. The <m>mild tin</m> is more even than the <m>sour tin</m>, which is whiter and seems to have been polished like a mirror.</ab>

To properly alloy the <m>tin</m> and the <m>lead</m>, you have to melt them together, Then, mix them together a little bit at a time and throw it often on a <m>marble tile</m>. And when it is going well, you will see it becoming unified and shining as if it were burnished. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much <m>lead</m> and sometimes due to too much <m>tin</m>. There is some <m>tin</m> allied with more <m>lead</m>. Ordinary <m>tin</m> is allied with some <m>lead</m>.</ab>
