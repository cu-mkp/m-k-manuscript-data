<ab>One <figure>℥</figure> of <m>verdigris</m> and 2 <figure>℥</figure>
of <m>coarse salt</m> &amp; a bit of <m>sublimate</m>, or crush some
<m>ocher</m> with <m>linseed oil</m>, and use it to cover the blade or
the very neat &amp; polished <m>iron</m>. &amp; let it dry on the fire
or in the sun. Then, to engrave &amp; make it beautiful, take a small
coin's worth of <m>verdigris</m> &amp; twice that quantity of <m>coarse
salt</m> &amp; about four grains of <m>ammoniac</m>, &amp; six grains of

<head>How to <m>silver</m> plate <m>copper</m> and <m>latten</m></head>

<ab>Mold the <m>silver</m> as the <m>gold</m>, &amp; put it in the oven

make it boil in <m>walnut oil</m>, &amp; then heat it a bit, &amp; put
it <x>into the <m>water</m> the <pro>silversmiths</pro> use to bleach
their works</x>.</ab>
