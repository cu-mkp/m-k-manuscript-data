<head>Casting</head>

<ab>

When you make a cast of delicate animals, like <al>snakes</al>, start by
casting the belly side, or the under-tail, for this side has straighter
lines which are easier to rework than the back side, which is more
veined and is more marked.</ab>

<head>Repairing burrs</head>

<ab>

Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a chaple or a burin, then
scrape the burrs with the side of a burin, or carefully with a small
file, and rub with <m>willow coals</m> and small brushes. Continue,
also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.</ab>

<head><m>Leaded</m> <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>

A lot of <sup><m>silver</m></sup> is wasted because of the <m>lead</m>
which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in
small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the <m>charcoal</m>
which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt
<m>silver coins</m>, like reals and others, and make them into ingots
prior to casting <al>lizards</al> or <al>animals</al>, for it comes out
better. I cleanly molded a small, <m>silver</m> <al>viper</al>, like in
the first <sup>recipe above</sup>. And at the end of the line of 4
<m>reals</m> (of 20 S of <pl>Spain</pl>), and one <m>coin</m> of 20 S
from <pl>France</pl>.</ab>

<head>Blowing</head>

<ab>

When you smelt <m>silver</m> and <m>gold</m> do not blow too hard or
with force, because the <m>charcoal</m> will become spent and the
crucible will sink and, potentially, spill over. But when your mold is
ready, blow strongly in order to properly heat the <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. When all are melted it is necessary to blow over the top
with a small bellows, doing the same for <m>gold</m>, for it removes and
reduces the smoke.</ab>
