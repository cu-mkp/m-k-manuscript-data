<ab>
daylight, pull out the <m>hairs</m> which make the tip too long with the ends of your fingernails, until the tip appears good to you, &amp; so that you notice in it the <m><al>rat</al> hairs</m> that are entirely black and the <m>hairs of the same <al>squirrel</al></m> that are <del>at the</del> whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind and tighten it very well with a thread in two places, then cut what is superfluous &amp;  fit it in a quill of appropriate size, of a <al>duck</al> or a <al>crow</al> for the small ones. Good brushes are those that, once dipped into <m>water</m>, do not bulge when you trace on your hand.</ab>

<ab>Every <m>oil</m> that imbibes into <m>paper</m> &amp;, when heated by fire, evaporates  &amp; leaves the <m>paper</m> clean, such as <m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m>aspic oil</m>, is good for making varnish.</ab>

<head>Furnace with bellows</head>


<ab>Before you put in the <m>metal</m>,  the back <sup>of the furnace</sup> needs to be red like a <m>charcoal</m> and well lit. Next, you <del>[illegible]</del> fill it up &amp; cover the <m>charcoal</m> &amp; adjust the bellows, otherwise the <m>metal</m> on top will melt as a result of the bellows &amp; its bottom will be curdled &amp; cool &amp; will not run. But if you proceed in this manner you can melt everything you like.</ab>

<head>Varnish on <m>paper</m></head>


<ab>The <pl>Germans</pl> make boxes <del>p</del> covered with painted <m>paper</m> &amp; varnish it with <m>egg white</m>, mixed with <m>gum</m> and some <m>oil</m>, not <m>aspic</m>, but another odorant which looks like <m>olive oil</m>. Every work done with <m>egg white</m> sustains <m>oil</m>. It is with this that <pro>painters</pro> trick the poor peasants, painting their bands of <m>taffeta</m> with this <m>egg white</m> to be done faster. But the first rain washes away everything.</ab>
