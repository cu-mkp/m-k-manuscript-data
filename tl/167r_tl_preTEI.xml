<ab>Mortars are made of the best alloy of <fr><m>métal</m></fr> and the finest possible <fr><m>rosette</m></fr> so that they do not burst, that is to say one part <fr><m>métal</m></fr> and two <x>parts</x> fine <m>rosette</m> or old caudron, which is even better. Some of them are of fifteen or seventeen lb. and are loaded with two and a half lb. of <m>grain powder</m>, and they are put on common windows and doors. Others are of a weight of 25 to 27 lb. and are loaded with eight lb. of powder. And in such a way, they are made according to the stress they have to resist. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the inside, they are made like a crucible, <figure>

Those of 4 s. lb. are eight <fr>lignes</fr> thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 <fr>lignes</fr>. They have xiii <fr>poulsses</fr> long and seven in diameter at the mouth and opening.</ab>
