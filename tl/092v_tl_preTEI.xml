<ab> The long <m>shells</m> that can be found in rivers of <m>fresh water</m>, being calcinated, make a <m>white and very fine [impalpable] sand</m> which moulds very clean..</ab>

<head>Freezing  <m>mercury</m></head>


<ab>It can be frozen, as I tested, letting it boil one or two hours in a rather large <m>iron</m> pan putting, for each ℥ of ☿, ii  ℥ of  <m>vert-de-gris</m> and  <m>vitriol</m> of <m>saltpetre</m>, each in the same quantity, with enough of the <m><pro>blacksmith</pro>'s old water.</m></ab>


<ab>Or melt 4 ℥ of <m>tin</m>, &amp; when it  has cooled, purify it by removing the <m>filth</m> on the top, then make a hole &amp; inside there add  i ℥ of ☿ &amp; if you remelt it, it will be like tin but it will be fragile. If you want to know if it is <m>tin</m> or ☿, redden a shovel &amp; put a small piece of your ingot on the top. If it is <m>tin</m>, the piece will melt &amp; remain, but if it is ☿, it will melt immediately then, crackling quite hard, it will evaporate. It must be frozen in a ladle or in a hollow crucible, &amp; make the hole medium sized.</ab>


<ab>It can also be frozen, as I tried, that is to say with <m>aqua fortis</m> which before corroded a bit of <m>silver</m>. This, mixed, will make <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>lead</m> fluid.</ab>

<head>Mixture</head>


<ab><m>Pure tin</m>, <m>frozen mercury,</m> smells like tin. <m>Iced tin</m>, <m>pure lead</m>, as much of one as of the other, makes a substance that melts very quickly but that is fragile &amp; white. I think that it would be good for soldering. [Takes a] long time to cool.</ab>
