<ab>Two kinds are made in <pl>Toulouse</pl>, one to cover rooms' walls which are finely woven, almost like <m>straw</m> hats worn by villagers, and are made in long rolls, some 10 <m>straws</m> wide, others 13. And they work on them mainly in summer and winter. Then when they prepare it they sew it, but beforehand they dye it in usually three colours: green, red and sometimes purple. The green one is made with only a <m>pastel tincture</m> since green is made from yellow and blue, so the <m>pastel</m> dyes the dark yellow <m>straw</m>. It becomes bright green. For red they use some <m>alum</m> and <m>brazil wood</m>, for purple they use <m>pastel</m> and some <m>coperous</m> which darkens blue with its black tincture.</ab>

<ab>They have no way to produce a perfect red that needs to be annealed. Try, however, the <m><pl>German</pl> red</m> which is scaled red. They produce their ordinary red with some <m>sanguine</m>, <m>iced pewter</m>, <m>lead rocks</m>, and some <m>iron file dust</m>. This red is to be applied on both sides of the <m>glass</m> because it is more colourful. If it were applied on one side only it would look pastel orange.</ab>

<ab>For 20 <cn>pounds</cn> they buy a <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>rosette</m> which is harder to melt than <m>brass</m> because it is milder. The milder great <m>metals</m> <add><figure>#</figure></add> are, the harder they are to melt. Because the <m>tin used to make bells</m> is fine and sour, it is easier to melt than <m>lead</m>, which is mild. <m>Brass</m> soured with <m>calamine</m> melts more quickly than <m>red copper</m>. The <m>metal</m> that is used to make bells is mixed with some <m>tin</m>, is very sour, and can be quickly melted. The more <m>silver</m> that is mixed in, the quicker it melts, and this is why <m>solders</m> are made with it. In <pl>Germany</pl> candelabras are made very light because they rotate by means of <m>water</m>, but they are breakable. A <ms>quintal</ms> of fine <m><pro>coppersmiths</pro>' rosette</m> is sold for 30 or 40 <cn>pounds</cn>. Another type used by <pro>founders</pro> is sold for 12 or 15 <cn>pounds</cn>. The <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>metal</m> six <cn>pounds</cn>.</ab>
