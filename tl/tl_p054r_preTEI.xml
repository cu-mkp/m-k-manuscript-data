<ab>to some of the upper boards, and one can tell when they want to
climb up when, on the leaf, they stretch out and raise their heads and a
part of their bodies when one takes them to heather branches where they
stop and begin to spin their prison, which we call cocoon, generally the
size of a pigeon egg, although there are some which are much bigger
because it sometimes happens that two or three and up to 11
<al>worms</al> put themselves in a cocoon, which is hairy and cottony,
around which ball is filoselle or floret, and of the cocoon, which is a
white, solid, continuous and firm skin, <m>silk</m> is made. The cocoon
is so hard that it is cut with difficulty with a fingernail. And yet to
leave its prison, the <al>worm</al> eats away at it on one end, and
after having stayed inside, living on its own juices for three weeks, it
comes out, reduced in size by half. Because when it begins to spin, it
is as long as a ring finger and has eight legs, and when it comes out it
is less than half as long and only has four legs. On the other hand, it
has become a butterfly and has wings; however, it does not fly. There
are males and females. As soon as they come out of the cocoon, the male
mates with the female, and they are put on a piece of white linen where
they lay their eggs, which will not be good and viable if the male was
not given to her. When the male has detached himself from a female, one
must get rid of it because it would not be good to give it to another
female. They finish spinning and laying eggs in three weeks and around
Saint John's Day. And then one keeps their eggs and grain until Holy
Week, as mentioned. Some <x>worms</x> spin among the leaves and make
their cocoons there without climbing high.</ab>
