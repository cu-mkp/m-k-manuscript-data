<ab>being at all expert in painting. If your <m>glass</m> pane is bulging as if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When you apply your <m>turpentine</m> colors to your <m>glass</m> panes, first place them on a hot tile &amp;, once they are hot, spread your colors &amp; leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your <m>tin</m> sheet.</ab>

<ab>Some take the root of <pa><la>Lapathium acutum maius</la></pa>, which looks like <pa><pro>monk</pro>’s-rhubarb</pa> or <pa>sorrel</pa>, &amp; using the root, which is yellow in summer, they dye threads &amp; similar things.</ab>

<ab>Some put <del>on</del> for four pounds of <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m> matter <del>four</del> that is in the <tl>retort</tl>, four ounces of common <m>water</m> in the container, which is better than putting it into the <tl>retort</tl>. The <m>alum</m> is de-phlegmed &amp; calcined such that the <m>water</m> does not have as many dregs. Many make it without de-phlegming the <m>alum</m>.</ab>

Some make it with <m>water</m> poured on pomace soured after being pressed by <pro>grape pickers</pro>, but it will not keep &amp; spoils in heat &amp; thunder storms.</ab>

<ab>Because <m>silver gilt</m> does not fear fire, it is cut into lozenges flat<del>[illegible]</del> on one side, then they are joined together in a star shape with a paste of crushed <m>enamel</m>, which is then melted &amp; the <m>enamel</m> is gilt with <m>gold</m> leaf and then reheated.</ab>

<ab>To fill some empty place that cannot be laden with hanging rocks, one puts a piece of thick <m>parchment</m> close to the fire, which shrinks &amp; crumples. Then one paints it with distemper, then in <m>oil</m>. Next one affixes it.</ab>
