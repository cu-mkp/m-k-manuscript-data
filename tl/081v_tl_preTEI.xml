<ab>Only <m>brick</m> very finely sifted, &amp; worn down one against another, is good for all castings of <m>lead</m> and <m>copper</m>, mixed with <m>urine</m>. It is necessary this be <m>whitish brick</m>.</ab>

<ab>Put in, at the end, when it is very hot and you want to cast, <m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; <m>saltpeter</m>, which removes <m>filth</m> &amp; heats it. Mix some <m><fr>ardides</fr></m> with the <m>latten</m>. @ Guard against the <m>metal</m> touching the <m>iron</m> or the <m>latten</m> of the <tl>box mold</tl>, but cover it with <m>sand</m> or <m>lute</m>. Make the cast very even.</ab>

<head>Sand</head>


<ab><m>Calcined black pebbles from the <env>river</env></m> are good for <m>lead</m>, but they are shaken loose for <m>metal</m>.</ab>


<ab>There is only <del><ill/></del> <m>clay earth with which one can make <m>tiles</m></m>, reheated &amp; reddened &amp; passed through a <tl>sleeve</tl> finely moistened with <m>glair</m>.</ab>

<head>Casting with a <tl>box mold</tl></head>


<ab>It is good to make it with <m><pa>boxwood</pa></m>. Turn it in order to make it even, as this is important for the casting. <m>Lute</m> also, or cover the mouth of the <tl>box mold</tl> with sand so that the melted <m>metal</m>, or <m>lead</m>,or <m>copper</m> does not touch the <tl>box mold</tl>’s <m>iron</m> or <m>latten</m>, because it makes it brittle, &amp; makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always higher than the <tl>mold</tl>. Also guard against the cast being too wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big, the weight of the substance that runs breaks &amp; shakes loose the <tl>mold</tl> &amp; makes it porous. When you have cast, gently hit the <tl>box mold</tl> frame, so that the substance spreads better. <m>Black lead of <fr>saulmon</fr></m> from the first melting makes a very neat one.</ab>
