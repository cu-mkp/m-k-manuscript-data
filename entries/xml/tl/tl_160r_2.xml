<head><m>Sand for flowers</m></head>

<ab>If it is cast thick, it bears down too much on the flowers &amp;
constricts them &amp; reduces them as if massed together. Take heed
therefore to temper it until thin, &amp; blow strongly before the flower
is covered. Cast at the side of the <tl>mold</tl>. And tempering the <m>sand</m>,
one ought not only to turn the <tl>spatula</tl> but to beat the <m>sand</m> in
<m>water</m> as if you were beating <m>glair of egg</m>.</ab>
