<head>Repairing</head>

<ab>It is better to repair little with the <tl>burin</tl> called
<tl><fr>onglet</fr></tl>, or with that which one calls
<tl><fr>chaple</fr></tl>, or some <tl>small file</tl>. But above all,
avoid touching your work, but only the flashing or the lump that will have
occurred during the cast. And while repairing, wet &amp; rub with your
<tl>very small <m><al>hog</al> bristle</m> brushes</tl>.</ab>
