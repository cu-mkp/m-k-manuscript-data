<head>Desiccative</head>

<ab><m>Lead white</m> &amp; <m>massicot</m> are the most desiccative,
nevertheless they need a good two <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. If you want
to prove whether an <m>oil</m> is desiccative, temper <m>lead white</m>
with it, &amp; if it produces a crust <del>in a
<ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms></del> soon it means that it will dessicate.</ab>
