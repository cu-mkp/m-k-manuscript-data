<head><tl>Mold</tl> made in two casts</head>

<ab>It is opened, once reheated, to clean it; next, one puts the
<tl>clamps</tl> on again, one <m><tl>lutes</tl></m> the <tl>mold</tl> &amp;
especially the joints, then one slowly dries the <m>earth</m>. And then,
as it no longer <m>smokes</m>, one leaves the <tl>mold</tl> to cool until you can
hold it without harm. Next, put in the <tl>presses</tl> or in the <m>sand</m>
in a <tl><fr>terrine</fr></tl>, &amp; cast in <m>tin</m>. For if you
were to cast in <m>silver</m> or <m>gold</m>, it would be necessary that
your <tl>mold</tl> be reheated twice &amp; cast when it would be completely 
red.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

If your <tl>mold</tl> <del><fr>f</fr></del>, through the fault of the
<m>plaster</m>, retracts <add>in the fire</add>, you need to open it
after the first reheating to tighten it again, &amp; <tl>clamp</tl> it
and <m><tl>lute</tl></m> again, and tighten again.</ab>
