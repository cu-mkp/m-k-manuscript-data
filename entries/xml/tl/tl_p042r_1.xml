  The
  <tl>
   mold of
   <m>
    earth
   </m>
  </tl>
  is reheated until, sometimes, it
is as if red, for otherwise the
  <m>
   metal
  </m>
  would spatter &amp;
would not do anything good. And similarly, the
  <fr>
   noyau
  </fr>
  on the
inside should be very reheated, &amp; mixed with
  <m>
   charcoal
powder
  </m>
  .
