Even though you cast in <m>lead</m>, the <tl>molds</tl> want to be well
dried, especially when they are large, and one needs to redden them on
the outside &amp; keep them in continuous heat until they no longer
<m>smoke</m> from inside. Do not place them to reheat at <tmp>different
times, but continue once you have started</tmp>. And do not place them
to cool <env>in the cold</env>, <del>With</del> for they would crack,
but leave them to become lukewarm near the fire, &amp; <sn>when they are still of such a heat as you have noticed before by putting
your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> in the hole, cast.</sn> And when the
<tl>mold</tl> is large, it needs more time to reheat &amp; dry, &amp; one
needs to cast hotter.</ab>
