<head><m>Wood with streaked grain</m></head>

<ab>The <m><pa>elm</pa></m>, in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks
diversified with grey and black, and the <m>root of the
<pa>maple</pa></m>, but one needs to choose well the grain of the
<m>wood</m>. One gives the <m><pa>maple</pa></m> a certain yellow color,
then one varnishes it.<comment rid="c_069r_04"/></ab>
