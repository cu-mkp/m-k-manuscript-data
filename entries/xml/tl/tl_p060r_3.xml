  <m>
   <pa>
    Walnut
   </pa>
   oil
  </m>
  extracted like
  <m>
   peeled
   <pa>
    almonds
   </pa>
  </m>
  is very white. The one of
  <m>
   <pa>
    <la>
     palmachristi

  </m>
  . And when the
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  has a little body, the
colors soften in it. For if the
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  is too clear, the colors run &amp;
do not have bond, even those that hardly have any body.
  <m>
   Fatty
oil
  </m>
  that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for
  <m>
   varnish
  </m>
  .
The
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as
  <m>
   common varnish
  </m>
  .
  <m>
   Oils
  </m>
  do not dry as quickly in cold
countries as in hot countries.
  <m>
   Oil
  </m>
  <env>
   exposed to the sun
  </env>
  is clarified well. But it fattens, if you put in
  <m>
   ceruse
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   lead filings
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   lead white
  </m>
  or

   calcined pulverized

  . To avoid this, put the

  in
  <m>
   clear water

  Colors in
  <m>
   oil

  , once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the
second colors; to prevent this, breathe on them &amp; the color will
take there.
