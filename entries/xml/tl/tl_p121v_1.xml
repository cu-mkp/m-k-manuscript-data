<ms>part</ms> <m>reheated <add>feather</add> alum</m>, and mix
it well. Then, having been prepared thus, and you wishing to mold it,
take the three <ms>parts</ms> of an <tl><ms>earthenware bowl, from which
the <pro>peasants</pro> eat their soup</ms></tl>, of the aforesaid
<m>sand</m>, &amp; add to it <m>pure <add>feather</add> alum,
reheated &amp; pulverized</m> in the <tl>mortar</tl>, <ms>as much as you
