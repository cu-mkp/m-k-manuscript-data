<head>Shadows</head>

<ab>The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear &amp;
thoroughly softened &amp; then the last ones very dark to give relief
well. <comment rid="c_059r_01"/>The <pl>Italians</pl> commonly make three shadows, the first one,
of light, very clear, the second one darker &amp; the third ones quite
strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from
the darkest to the clearest.</ab>

The <m>varnish</m> is more beautiful on the panel when the color has
imbibed well.</ab>
