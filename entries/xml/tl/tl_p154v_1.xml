<ab>It is very capricious to cast. It must be cast very hot. And to better
achieve your goal, throw on it some <m>sal ammoniac</m> to thin it. Alloy
it as well with a little <m>red copper</m> and, when you want to cast, a
little <m>tin</m> to make it run better. It always leaves a tail like
<m>melted glass</m>. It does not require as long a gate as
others.</ab></div></entry>
