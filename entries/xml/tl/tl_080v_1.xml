Make sure the <tl>pegs</tl> of your<lb/>
<tl>frame</tl> enter easily so that <corr><del><fr>n</fr></del></corr><lb/>
<del>in opening</del> the <tl>frame</tl> will easily open<lb/>
without shifting anything, and that your <tl>frames</tl><lb/>
fit well together, &amp; that the <tl>table is<lb/>
quite even</tl>.</ab>

<ab>They usually cast with <m>solder</m>, even the things that should
not come out empty, for the latter require <m>fine &amp; soft tin</m>,
which however would not release, &amp; would not come out empty if it
was mixed or had some <m>looking-glass tin</m> <del>mix</del>
<add>in</add> it, just like they put in a little of it in <m>soft
tin</m>. They engrave their works on <m>stones of which are made the
sharpening stones or files of <pro>barbers</pro></m>, which are found in
<env>great flakes near the mountains</env>, &amp; resemble
<m>slate</m>. They are of three colors: reddish, which is not as
perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire
<del>&amp; as</del>, one <del><fr>dard</fr></del> of the color of dark
<m>slate</m>, the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they
imprint it on <tl><m><fr>carton</fr></m></tl> as thick as one
<ms><bp>finger</bp></ms>, <add>to serve as a pattern,</add> then with a
little <tl>compass</tl> &amp; little matching <m>iron fittings</m>, they
engrave their figures, having first flattened their <m>stones</m> &amp;
worn down one against the other, they make their <del><fr>p</fr></del>
<tl>molds</tl> of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins
perfectly, because the <m>stones</m> render themselves even. Before
casting, they rub the <tl>mold</tl> with <m>tallow</m>, which has quickly
absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking <m>fine powder of
quicklime</m> in a <tl><m>linen</m></tl>, they pounce the <tl>mold</tl> while
beating with the <tl><m>linen</m></tl> on top, then blow a little on top
to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents, if
the work is largish. They make them in this manner, as you see
represented here. They pierce a hole in some place on the medal that is
least visible. And then with a <tl>borer</tl> they pierce the <tl>mold</tl> on
the side of the medal.

And if they want their work to stay pierced in any place, they drive in
<tl>a bit of <m>cork</m></tl> at this place in the <tl>mold</tl>. And
the <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m><lb/>

Try to engrave with <m>distilled vinegar</m>.</ab>

Try <m>calcined <al>oyster</al> shells</m>. They are said to be
excellent for molding.</ab>
