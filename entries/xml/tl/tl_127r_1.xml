<ab>When your <tl>mold of <m>plaster</m></tl> is done &amp; dried, take
heed that your <tl>mold</tl> be of good release, for sometimes it
happens that the animal, being wounded or thin &amp; withered, makes
wrinkles, where <del><fr>retire</fr></del> its scales are, where the <m>plaster</m> enters. And this not being of good release,
the <m>wax</m> animal would attaches itself &amp; break &amp; you would never
have it perfect. <emph>Take heed</emph> also to make your gates for the
<m>wax</m> very wide. Thus, &amp; the gates should not be too thick.
They are made when <del>the animal is</del>
