<head>Molding a <al>crab</al></head>

<ab>It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold it well, because one needs
to proceed differently than with other animals, because its shell is
very difficult to <del><fr>mou</fr></del><comment rid="c_130v_02"/> burn &amp; in this case, one
<del>it</del> needs to sometimes reheat the <tl>mold</tl> three
or four times. And with all of this, it leaves a hard crust, grey like
<m>ash</m>. But because it does not mold in one piece &amp; one cast
like plants, but rather in two casts like <al>snakes</al> that release
well, one removes this crust, <add>not with <m>quicksilver</m>, which
would do nothing,</add><comment rid="c_130v_01"/> after it
has been opened, with the very fine point of a <tl>penknife</tl> with
dexterity, as with the little crusts of the second cast, which enter in
the nooks that the <m>sand</m> or the molded animal made. But,
<del><fr>la</fr></del><comment rid="c_130v_03"/> because it has curved legs,

<div id="p130v_1" part="y"><ab>Therefore, as you have molded it on
one side, which is on the back, in the same fashion as others, uncover its
belly &amp; all its curved legs. Make your second cast in the same fashion
as others, but as it will have set, keep from opening the <tl>mold</tl>
until you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because of its curved
legs, you would break everything. In this lies the dexterity. If you
recognize, after having reheated &amp; opened it, that the crust is not
burned enough, reheat until it is.</ab>

<del>Know that</del> <add>For</add> opening the <tl>mold</tl>, there is
no need to soak it, for once reheated, it will open by itself.</ab>
