<head>Color of water</head>

<ab><add>For</add><comment rid="c_012v_01"/> the color of water, one passes a <tl>soft file</tl>
on the <wp>guards</wp> to whiten them, then the <tl>burnisher</tl>. Next, one
makes them pass to blue until they turn grey. Next, when they are still
moderately hot, one passes the <m>bloodstone</m> over them, and when
they cool, one turns them to reheat them, for the color of water is made
only in several passes. And if the <wp>guards</wp> were not warm, the
<m>bloodstone</m> would scrape &amp; undo the color. One needs to take
heed that the <wp>guards</wp> do not pass too far beyond grey, for they would throw
off <m>filth</m> that would prevent the color from taking. One needs almost one
<ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms> for preparing, smoothing &amp; setting in the
color of water, but as they pass a little beyond blue, it is enough for
grey &amp; another color. Grey is the lesser color after <m>varnish</m>,
which is of two colors, either yellow or black.</ab>
