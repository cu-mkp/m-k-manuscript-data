<head>For keeping <tl>candles</tl> from dripping and making them white</head>

<ab>Having made them, put into the <tl>mold</tl> <m>fresh water</m> well
beaten with <m>bran</m>, which should not at all be purged of its
<m>flour</m>, so that the <m>water</m> becomes white. And dip your
<tl>candles</tl> in that, then leave them to dry. And do thus two or three
times.</ab>
