<head>For varnishing</head>

<ab><m>Turpentine varnish</m> does not need any <m>glue</m> because it
is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the <m>wood</m> like that
of <m>spike lavender</m> &amp; <m>sandarac</m>. Also, that of <m>spike
lavender</m> does not require any <m>glue</m> on <m>iron</m> &amp;
similar things that do not absorb. But on <m>wood</m> &amp; on colors
which <del>have</del> <add>do not have</add> <m>gum</m> or 
<m>distemper glue</m>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
<m>hide glue</m> &amp; to let it dry &amp; to
varnish.</ab>
