<ab><m>Lake</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m> &amp; <m>ceruse</m> are easy to
work in <m>oil</m>, but every kind of <m>azure</m> is difficult. And to
make beautiful <m>azure</m>, one needs to layer it not with large
strokes of the <tl>paintbrush</tl> but with small strokes of the
point. Not only <m>ash</m> &amp;
<m><fr>azur d’<pl>Acre</pl></fr></m><comment rid="c_059r_02"/> but mainly <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m>
which one needs to choose to be very delicate. <del>For it</del>
Otherwise you will not <del><fr>v</fr></del> be able to work with it
except with much work, and even then you need to allay it with
<m>turpentine</m> to give it body, and mix it with a little <m>lead
white</m>. Any <m>azure</m> wants neither to be ground nor washed for it
loses color &amp; becomes pale. But putting it powdered on your
<tl>palette</tl>, you will thin it little by little either with
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> or <m>turpentine oil</m>,
dipping a <tl>knife point</tl> in the <m>oil</m>, then
tempering it little by little on the said
<tl>palette</tl>.</ab></div>
