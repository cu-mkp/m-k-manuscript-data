<hr/><emph>I tried</emph> <m>plaster</m> &amp;
<m>brick</m> alone and molded <fr>en noyau</fr> like others. My
<tl>mold</tl> was very neat, having lightly <m>oiled</m> &amp; rubbed
with <m>eau-de-vie</m> my medal. I made my gate ample at the entrance,
becoming narrower up to the medal, which was very thin. I notched the gate
which embraced well the medal. I dried the <tl>mold</tl> well on a slow
fire &amp;, at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let it
<ms>cool in such a way that <sn>I could hold my <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>
to it without burning myself</sn></ms>. I made an alloy of 4
<ms>℥</ms> of <m>tin</m> &amp; six
<ms><fr>deniers</fr></ms> of <m>lead</m>. I cast red, and it came out
well. Next, I put in for 4 <ms>℥</ms> of
<m>tin</m>, xii <ms><fr>deniers</fr></ms> of <m>lead</m>; it came out
very well.</ab>

When there is nothing to burn in the <tl>mold</tl>, it is not necessary to reheat

burn, yes.</ab></div>

<head>Casting of <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> in <m>plaster</m></head>

<ab>

If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very
weighty and that does not need to burn in the <tl>mold</tl>, you can
cast in <m>plaster</m> &amp; <m>brick</m>, mixed like above, and not in
<m>plaster</m> alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if
it is not accompanied. But, with <m>brick</m>, it holds well.
However, take heed to dry out your <tl>mold</tl> at length &amp; on a
slow fire &amp; with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But
when your work is of flowers or other things that want <del>to
be</del> their <tl>molds</tl> reheated &amp; set ablaze, mix in some
<m>feather alum</m> &amp; even some <m><la>crocum</la></m>. I have
molded in <m>plaster</m> &amp; <m>brick</m> very neatly, &amp; it
withstood several castings.</ab>
