<head>For adjusting a crooked <wp>cannon</wp></head>

<ab>Take off the breech and place it on an <tl>smooth &amp; well-leveled
table</tl> and pass through the inside a <tl>very smooth string without
knots</tl>, on each end of which there should be a <tl><m>plumb</m></tl>
hanging from each side. Then look into the barrel along the
<tl>string</tl>, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the
place where it does not touch &amp; hit with a <tl>hammer</tl> on the outside on
that side &amp; in the same place, &amp; thus it will be righted, &amp;
do thus all the way round.</ab>
