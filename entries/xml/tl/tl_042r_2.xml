<head><m>Wax</m> for seal and imprint</head>

<ab>For the large <m>wax</m> seals, you need to have <m>tepid water</m>
always ready &amp; <del><fr>apre</fr></del> keep your <m>wax</m> in
it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your <bp>hands</bp>
to render it very uniform, for otherwise the <m>water</m> that would get in
between would prevent it from becoming uniform. Next, you will press it into
whatever you want and put three or four pieces of <m>paper</m> on, &amp;
with a <tl>stick</tl> <del>you</del> even &amp; round like a
<tl>pestle</tl>, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
will attach itself to the <m>paper</m>, which will help you lift it off
the <tl>mold</tl>. Thus you will imprint better than if you were to cast it
molten. You can carve the figures &amp; <m>gild</m> them, <m>silver</m> them, &amp;
paint them with <m>colors in varnish</m>, &amp; transfer them onto a
base of <m>glass</m> painted with <m>colors in turpentine &amp;
mastic</m>. And if you want to apply these plates by incrustation, do it
with <m>gum ammoniac </m> tempered with <m>vinegar</m>, and you will have
good <m>glue</m>.</ab>
