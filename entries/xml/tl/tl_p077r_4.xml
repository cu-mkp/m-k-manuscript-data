put it into another <tl><m>glass</m> vial</tl> &amp; mix it very well.
And on the rest of the said <m>benzoin</m> that remains at the bottom of
the said first <tl>vial</tl>, put the rest of the <m>water</m> over this,
and do as before when you see that the case is going well, and mix the
first <m>water</m> with the second. By means of this you will be able to
use it for something more noble.</ab>
