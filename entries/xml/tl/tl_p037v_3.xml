<head><m>Yellow Amber</m></head>

<ab>

It is cut with a <tl>file</tl>, then one passes a certain <tl><m>pulverized
salt</m></tl> over it, which an <pl>Englishman</pl> called
<tl><df><fr>desramonet</fr></df></tl>. But I suppose that this was <tl><m>pulverized
pumice stone</m></tl>, for it had the harshness of <m><fr>ar&#232;ne</fr></m>. And with a
taut <tl>cord</tl>, he polished his <m>amber</m>, then passed
<tl><m>tripoli from <pl>Bretagne</pl></m></tl> on it with the
<tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, others with a piece of <tl><m>leather</m></tl>
or a <tl>cane</tl>. <m>Amber</m> loses its color if an unhealthy person
wears it, &amp; becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be
soaked for one <ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms> in <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, then boiled a
little in it.
