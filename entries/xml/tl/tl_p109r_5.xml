<ab>when they want to bite or eat something, they do not bite with a
direct attack but with sinuous turns &amp; from the side, as do
<pn>Satan</pn><comment rid="c_109v_02"/> &amp; his <pro>disciples</pro>. It has a small head but
a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small &amp; inconsequential,
but the consequences of it are very great. It abstains from eating seven
or eight <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>, once it has devoured some
<al>frog</al>. It can swallow three or four of them, one after the
other, and what it devoured is neither corrupted nor consumed in one go
in its stomach, but <del><fr>p</fr></del> some part little by little,
that is to say bones and everything. And the remains are found as fresh
as when it had devoured them, such that sometimes, when one presses
&amp; torments it, it renders up what it has engulfed, parts of which
are found totally consumed &amp; others as fresh as if it were alive. It
can keep a <al>frog</al>
engulfed for two to three <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> &amp; renders it up completely alive.</ab>
