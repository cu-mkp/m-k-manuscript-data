it in the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, which you will cover with an appropriate
<tl>tile</tl>, a bit thick, in order that heat reverberates better
there. Then, set it on the <tl>grate</tl> of your <tl>furnace</tl>,
having put under a few <tl>thick rounded squares</tl>. Next, fill your
<tl>furnace</tl> to the opening with <tl>charcoal</tl>, so that it will
be heaped, and let it kindle, and always maintain the heat evenly
without letting the <tl>charcoal</tl> decrease. And for this effect,
always make it so that the <tl>furnace</tl> is heaped &amp; full of
<tl>charcoal</tl>, and maintain it thus for one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms>.
The first experience that I made of it, it only returned a yellow mass,

the other, for making the heat reverberate.</ab>
