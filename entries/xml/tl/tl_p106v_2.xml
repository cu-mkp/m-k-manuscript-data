  as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste, &amp; that it is
not so easy to handle as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is
cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws off big bubbles or
exhalations, in the middle &amp; around, as long as a
  <ms>
   <bp>
    finger
   </bp>
  </ms>
  . Seeing it in this state, remove it from the
fire, for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it
would be too much &amp; would not set as well. For when it becomes red
&amp; overheats, it loses its strength &amp; spoils the
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  . Leave it
to cool before mixing it with the other
  <m>
   sands
  </m>
  . And when it is cold,
mix and mold, for the sooner after its cooking you use it, the
sooner it will set.
