<head><m>Talcum</m> mixed in the <tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>I took the one from which I had pulled the <m>oil</m>. I crushed it
very finely even more <del><fr>s</fr></del> in a <tl><m>steel</m>
mortar</tl> with a <tl>pestle</tl>, very lumpy like a <tl>file</tl>. I
rendered it very fine &amp; in a cottony &amp; downy powder. I mixed it
with <m>sand</m> &amp; mixed it together &amp; cast it <fr>en noyau</fr>. It
molded <del><fr>en no</fr></del> very neatly &amp; one ought not to doubt
that it holds in the fire.</ab>
