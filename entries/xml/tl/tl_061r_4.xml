<head>Lights</head>

<ab>Your <tl>paintbrush</tl> shows it to you by casting a shadow
which must always follow the <bp>back of your hand</bp>, not in a
straight line like this
<figure size="x-small" id="fig_p061r_1" link="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5LVgyaXJ0Rl8wMjA"/>,
for the light would be too crude &amp; too harsh, but obliquely &amp; as
if at an incline, thus
<figure size="small" id="fig_p061r_2" link="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5a0g1a0hvTUdHRFE"/>.
It is necessary that the panel not be facing the
<env>light</env> head-on, but half turned
against it. And above all look for soft light, for it makes soft both
the shadow &amp; the work, as a harsh light a harsh
work.</ab>
