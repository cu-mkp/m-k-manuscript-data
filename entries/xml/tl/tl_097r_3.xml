<head>Gilding with <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>One needs to prepare the guards &amp; whiten them with a 
<del><fr>li</fr><ill/></del> <tl>file</tl>, a little coarser
<del>for</del> than for <m>gold</m>. And one makes them pass beyond
grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
<m>silver foil</m>, then separate it with a <tl>knife</tl>; next, apply
it to the guard with <del><fr>a small</fr></del> <tl>tweezers</tl>
&amp; a small <tl>burnisher</tl>. And then, reheat &amp; apply until they
are all gilt with <m>silver</m>. Next, one needs to cover them for the
third time with the doubled <m>foil</m>, as has been said, then burnish them
very well &amp; with force, not with the <m>bloodstone</m> but with a
strong <tl>burnisher</tl>. Just as the <tl>burnisher</tl> ought not to
burnish <m>gold</m>.</ab>
