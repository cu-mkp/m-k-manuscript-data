<head>Excellent tempering bath for <wp>cuirass</wp> bodies</head>

<ab>Take <m>river water</m>, as clear &amp; running as
possible, &amp; heat it to a little more than tepid. Then take a bunch
of <m><pa>weld</pa></m>, &amp; take the grain of it &amp; put it into
the said <m>water</m> &amp; boil it thoroughly, stirring it with a <tl>stick</tl>, then pour it into a
<tl>muid</tl> or other <tl>vessel</tl>, then throw into it two
<ms>pecks</ms> of <m>salt</m>. </ab>

<ab>Next, take a <ms><tl>big cauldron</tl></ms> of the said
<m>river water</m> &amp; heat it to a litte more than
tepid. &amp; take three or four <ms>double <bp>handfuls</bp></ms> of
<m>fatty red earth</m>, soak it &amp; throw it into the <tl>cauldron</tl>
with the said <m>water</m>. Take <ms>as much <m><al>pigeon</al> dung</m>
as the said <m>earth</m></ms>, &amp; <ms>as much <m><al>horse</al>
dung</m></ms>, &amp; <ms>as much <m>iron filings</m></ms>, &amp; mix the
whole separately, &amp; throw it into the <tl>cauldron</tl> &amp; leave
it for two or three <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Then throw it afterward
into the said <tl>muid</tl> and stir the whole thoroughly together. And
the older this temper is, the better it will be.</ab>
