<head><tl>Molds</tl></head>

<ab>

For those <del>which</del> in which one needs to burn something and
which do not open before being reheated, one does not make any casts
before it is reheated. For large <tl>molds</tl> in which the gate is big
and ample, it is necessary that the gate be well notched &amp;
scratched, in order that the weight of the <m>metal</m> does not go with
much force. They make hardly any flashing if they are pressed. But before
pressing them, put between them and the <tl>press</tl> some <tl>pieces
of <m>plump<comment rid="c_164v_03"/> &amp; thick felt</m></tl>, which is hardly yet crushed, for it fills the concavities &amp; keeps the <tl>mold</tl> from
cracking. The <tl>clamps</tl> should be placed before reheating or
drying it.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">



When the <m>earth</m> from which you make the <tl><m>earthen</m>
slab</tl> to arrange your animal is too soft, the <tl>points</tl> that
you put in it come out easily &amp; come undone when you cast in the
<m>sand</m>, &amp; thus the <tl>mold</tl> spoils and the shape comes undone.
Therefore, when you recognize that your <tl>slab</tl> will be too tender &amp; soft, spread on top some <m>hot ashes</m> &amp; blow with
the <tl>bellows</tl>.</ab>
