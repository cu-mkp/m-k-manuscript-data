<head>Gate</head>

<ab>

When you make the gate of some delicate animal, like a <al>snake</al>,
make it come from the side of the belly &amp; under the tail, for from
the side, there are only straight lines, which are a lot easier to
repair than the back, which is more visible &amp; more marked.</ab>
