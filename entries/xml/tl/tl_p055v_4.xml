<head>For casting</head>

<ab><m>Chalk</m> most recently taken from the <env>quarry</env> is good
for <m>lead</m>. One ought neither to wet nor grind it, but render it subtle by
<tl>pestling</tl> or scraping &amp; passing through a <tl>sieve</tl>. Thus for <m>pumice</m>,
which one ought not to grind with <m>water</m>, nor corrupt its nature. 
<m>Lead</m> should be but little mixed with <m>tin</m>,
only for giving it strength, and two <ms>parts</ms>
<del>of <m>tin</m> for</del> <m>lead</m> for <del>of</del> one of
<m>tin</m> or more.</ab></div>
