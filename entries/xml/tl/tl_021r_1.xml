<ab>As for small <wp>cannons</wp> which are not loaded with a <tl>ladle</tl>,
one charges them with <m>powder</m> <ms>up to the escutcheon</ms>,<comment rid="c_018v_02"/> which
is placed on the <wp>piece</wp> with due proportion.</ab>

<ab>To point a <wp>cannon</wp>, that is to say to take its aim, one needs to take
the sight, that is to say aim, from the sides before the top, that is to
say above the <wp>cannon</wp>. For by aiming along the top, you will be better
able to find the line tending to your target, but you would not find out
if the <wp>cannon</wp> tends more to one side than the other. Therefore take your
sight on one side, then on the other &amp; adjust your <wp>piece</wp> to the
point at which you aim. Then take your sight from the top of the breech,
which will be done quickly. Next, lower your <wp>piece</wp> a little at your
discretion if you are within true range, because the force of the
<m>powder</m> usually makes it rise. But if you were farther away than
your <wp>piece</wp> shoots at point-blank, you would need to consider that the
weight of the ball would make it lower.</ab></div>
