<head>For bringing a <wp>cannon</wp> over <env>land</env></head>

<ab>

<del>If you have</del> To bring a <wp>cannon</wp>, one needs a hundred
<pro>pioneers</pro> or more to flatten the tracks by levelling ditches
&amp; others obstacles, such as <pa>trees</pa>, <m>stone</m> mounds
&amp; similar things to make gabions on the way. Once one is close to
the place one wants to batter, the <pro>gunner</pro> goes <tmp>at
night</tmp> to reconnoiter the most convenient place to mount the
battery<lb/></ab>

It is good if the platform is slightly inclined toward the front because
the <wp>piece</wp> is more quickly mounted for battery &amp; holds the blast
better &amp; batters more fiercely.</ab>

<ab>&amp; if he does not see well, one gives a false alarm in order
that those on the inside throw <wp>torches</wp>. Very often, one batters where it
is strongest because the assailed, disdaining the battery, do not make repairs there.
Commonly, there are not many garrets &amp; other defenses in
that place. And when one has made a breach at the strongest part &amp; the
<wp>cannon</wp> removed, it will surprise the assailed. One approaches
<env>fortified towns</env> <tmp>at night</tmp>, but to <env>poorly

behind the gabions to keep the <pro>pioneers</pro> safe, while behind,
they fill the gabions with some <m>earth</m> by means of their
<tl>shovels</tl>. And while one does this, one raises some false alarm
on another side. And before, one has</ab>

<corr><del>The gabions</del></corr> The <pro>pioneers</pro> carry the
boards to make a level ground or a platform of four
<bp><ms>fingers</ms></bp> or <ms>half a <bp>foot</bp></ms> thick, and
one sets them into the <m>earth</m>. The platform is five or six
<del><fr>cano</fr></del> <bp><ms>feet</ms></bp> larger than the wheels of the <wp>cannon</wp>
on each side <del><fr>m</fr></del> if there is only one <wp>cannon</wp>. But if
there are more, the platforms touch. The distance which is between the
<wp>pieces</wp> is the <ms>width of two gabions</ms>. As long as the battery
lasts, the <pro>gunner</pro>s sleep &amp; eat close to a <wp>cannon</wp>. In
small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach the <wp>pieces</wp>
but one puts plenty of gabions that are high &amp; goes running to them. In large</ab>

barricades <del>some</del> <add>some</add> companions-in-arms on guard duty to defend

<ab>a hundred <ms>paces</ms> away from the battery &amp; one surrounds
them with barricades or trenches. And there one goes to get
<m>powder</m> in <tl>bags</tl> or <tl>frails</tl>. And each <wp>piece</wp> has
its own <tl>frail</tl> for loading three or four times. Then, when the
<wp>cannon</wp> is set on the platform, one puts a board that is proof of an
<wp>arquebus</wp> between two gabions. Then a <pro>gunner</pro> loads it with a
<tl>ladle</tl>, &amp; with the <tl>rammer</tl> which is at
<del><fr>len</fr></del> the other end of the <tl>ladle</tl>, two men
ram the <m>powder</m> as much as they can, in nine or ten pushes, until
they find the <m>powder</m> to be hard &amp; well-compacted. Next,
another puts <m>hay</m> or <m>straw</m> and the <del>r</del> others
ram a little. Another puts the ball and the <m>hay</m>-bearer puts in
as much of it as before &amp; one rams a little. Some put
<tl><m>wooden</m> bungs</tl> but this runs the risk of making the <wp>piece</wp>
burst. And where one has to fire many <del><wp>cannon</wp></del> shots, one
would need many <tl>bungs</tl>, which would cost much to carry. Once the
<wp>cannon</wp> is loaded, xx or xxv <pro>pioneers</pro> push it forward with
bars, keeping to one side behind the gabions without taking off the
board until the <wp>cannon</wp> reaches it. Once the <wp>cannon</wp> is in front, the
<pro>gunner</pro> mounts it with the <tl>wedges</tl> which are at the
back, taking the sight on each side and then in the middle. Then another
who is nearby gives fire. Each <del>gunner</del> <wp>cannon</wp> needs
3 <pro>gunners</pro>: the loader, the one who aims, the one who gives
fire. Sometimes, against a camp or into a breach, one shoots cartridges,
made as you have elsewhere, or else one uses a <m>basan</m> full of
<m>flint stones</m>, <m>cart nails</m> &amp; similar.
<del><fr>P</fr></del> A <del><fr>ch</fr></del> <wp>cannon</wp> must not move
unless it has two harnesses, be they of <m>wood</m> or <m>iron</m>. And
to furnish the wheels, powder box, and other furniture of the <wp>cannon</wp>,
one needs seven <ms>quintals</ms> and a half of <m>iron</m>.
<del>For the <fr>pre</fr></del> The best battery is done at a curtain
wall, some say, <del>for</del> that is, as if at an
<del><fr>bieve</fr></del> angle, for by doing this you shake loose
several stones.<hr/></ab>

Some put small wheels of the <wp>piece</wp> and a thick board to the end of the
carriage of the <wp>piece</wp> in order that it may be drawn more quickly and
without making a noise. Others put <m>leather</m> all around the
<del>the</del> wheels &amp; also put <m>leather</m> soles or shoes on
the <al>horsesâ€™</al> hooves in order that one does not hear
them.</ab></div>
