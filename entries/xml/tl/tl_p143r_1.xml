 Molding

 <ab>
  The
  <al>
   <env>
    water
   </env>
   turtle
  </al>
  is more beautiful to mold
because it has prettier scales &amp; straight legs. And
  <al>
   those of the

      garrigue

  have crooked ones. They are of long
life; getting ready to put them to death, open their mouth &amp; pass a long
  <tl>
   penknife
  </tl>
  through all the intestines, &amp; then make it swallow
some
  <m>
   vinegar
  </m>
  mixed with
  <m>
   eau-de-vie
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   <bp>
    urine
   </bp>
  </m>
  , as for
  <al>
   snakes
  </al>
  . One needs to mold them in several pieces, &amp; the
back itself, sometimes, because the sides for some are narrower than
elsewhere &amp; are not released on this occasion. To make them die, one
ought not to boil them, for they come apart, &amp; even the shell, from the
  <m>
   hot water
  </m>
  . They come out better hollow, because their great
thickness corrupts the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  .

   <al>
    Those from
    <env>
     water

   are more vigorous.

   are thinner, slower &amp; more
sleepy. If you scratch
   <al>
    those of the
    <env>
     water
    </env>
   </al>
   on their
shells, however sleepy they are, they move.

  They keep themselves, in the
  <tmp>
   winter

numbed by the

   under

  One ought not to mold them as soon as they are dead because they are still too
stiff. But on
  <tmp>
   the following day
  </tmp>
  , you will manipulate them &amp;
fold their legs as you wish.
