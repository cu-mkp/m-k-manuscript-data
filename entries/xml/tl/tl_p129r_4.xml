<head>Molded <pa>roses</pa></head>

They are awkward to mold because the petals are very fine &amp; weak
&amp; doubled. But, to <del><fr>obl</fr></del> avoid this, one needs to
anoint them with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, which is very dessicative. And having
quickly dried, it firms &amp; stiffens the petals to be able to separate
them &amp; withstand the <m>tempered sand</m>. The same is done with <al>flies</al>,
with <pa>pansies</pa> &amp; similar delicate things, with flowers from
the <pa>caper plant</pa>.</ab>
