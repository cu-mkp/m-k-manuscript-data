 Gilding with
 <m>
  silver
 </m>
 <ab>
  One needs to prepare the
  <wp>
   guards
  </wp>
  &amp; whiten them with a
  <del>
   <fr>
    li
   </fr>
   <ill>
   </ill>
  </del>
  <tl>
   file
  </tl>
  , a little coarser
  <del>
   for
  </del>
  than for
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  . And one makes them pass beyond
grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
  <m>
   silver foil
  </m>
  , then separate it with a
  <tl>
   knife
  </tl>
  ; next, apply
it to the
  <wp>
   guard
  </wp>
  with
  <del>
   a small
  </del>
  <tl>
   tweezers
  </tl>
  &amp; a small
  <tl>
   burnisher
  </tl>
  . And then, reheat &amp; apply until they
are all gilt with
  <m>
   silver
  </m>
  . Next, one needs to cover them for the
third time with the doubled
  <m>
   foil
  </m>
  , as has been said, then burnish them
very well &amp; with force, not with the
  <m>
   bloodstone
  </m>
  but with a
strong
  <tl>
   burnisher
  </tl>
  . Just as the
  <tl>
   burnisher
  </tl>
  ought not to
burnish
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  .
