It is necessary that the <m>iron</m> wire of its cage be of the
thickest, in order that, thinking of leaving, it will not be
hurt. Cover, from the moment that it is taken, its cage with
<tl>canvas</tl>. One needs to feed it the first

cage into the <bp>hand</bp> &amp; opening its beak, &amp; with a
<tl>small <m>wooden</m> pin</tl>, put it in its throat &amp; make it
swallow. And continue thus until it is no longer opinionated. This is
done for sustaining it, for if it were to become thin, it would die.<hr/></ab>
