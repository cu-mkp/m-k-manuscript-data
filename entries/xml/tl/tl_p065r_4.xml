One cannot layer <m>oil</m> on cut <m>paper</m> &amp; model as in
<m>distemper</m> because the color would run. Thus, to <m>gild</m> with

All fatty colors, such as <m>ceruse</m> and <m>minium</m>,
<m>massicot</m>, <m>ocher</m>, <m>lead white</m>, are good for making

<head>Fatty colors</head>

<ab>If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
colors have penetrated, it means that this place is fatty, &amp; that
the second colors one layers on would not take easily, unless
you rub this place with <m>soap</m> or <bp>breathe</bp> on it, because the
humidity will make the colors take.</ab>

Every color or thing that becomes dense when <m>water</m> is put in during the
grinding has <df>body</df>. But those which do not have it, such as
<m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m>, <m>lake</m>, &amp;c, become clear.</ab>
