<head><m>Blood of <al>snakes</al></m></head>

<ab>If you need to cut some <al>snake</al> inside the <tl>mold</tl> to
burn it, cut it far from the entrance of the
<tl>mold</tl> lest <m>blood</m> remains, for it would
make a crust that afterward would not be taken away by the same
<m>quicksilver</m> &amp; would remove the impressions from your
<tl>mold</tl>.</ab>
