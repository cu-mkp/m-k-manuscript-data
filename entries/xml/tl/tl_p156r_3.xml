<ab><m>Lead</m> is so fatty &amp; soft that one cannot strike it boldly,
&amp; one needs to have a <bp>very light hand</bp>. The other <m>great
metals</m> are easier. With a <tl>burin</tl> called the
<tl><fr>onglet</fr></tl> you make &amp; retrace the more delicate lines,
with the <tl>ordinary engraving burin</tl> the broader ones, and with
the <tl><fr>chaple</fr></tl> you remove the big flashing, and with the
<tl>small chisels</tl> you soften the harshness of the lines, you smooth, you
add relief to a line.</ab>
