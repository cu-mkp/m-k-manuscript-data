One used to give them with <tl><m>leather</m> sleeves or bags</tl>,
which for the best result <del>is</del> must be of <m><al>cat</al>
skin</m> which is more mitten-like than any other. And then one would
start to fold back the <tl>sleeve</tl> on one side &amp; one would
continue to fold it back &amp; twist it around itself &amp; in that way
the clyster would run gently. But this manner takes longer &amp; is less
convenient than the <tl>syringe</tl> which has been discovered since,
with which a man alone easily gives a clyster. It is true that
it always causes <bp>wind</bp> at the end.</ab>
