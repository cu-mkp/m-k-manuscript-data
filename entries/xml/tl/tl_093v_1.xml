<head>Faces in <m>distemper</m></head>

<ab>Because colors in <m>distemper</m> dry promptly &amp; one would not
have leisure to perfect the shadows &amp; touches on the face, one wets
the reverse of the face which is on <m>canvas</m> with a wet
<tl>sponge</tl>. Then, with a small <tl>paintbrush</tl>, one makes
the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
areas. And with another <tl>paintbrush</tl>, one does the shadows
<add>again</add> by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
because they are made of <m>bistre</m>, which stains the <m>canvas</m>
like <m>rust</m>. The said <m>bistre</m> is good <del>with</del> for
making shadows in <m>distemper</m> <del>mix</del>, for in <m>oil</m> it
has no body &amp; would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in
the said <m>bistre</m>, for shadow, <m><fr>ocre de ru</fr></m> &amp; a
little <m>sap green</m>. The best <m>bistre</m> is the greasy &amp;
shiny kind from the <env>fireplaces of large kitchens</env>. It is
difficult to grind &amp; <sn>screeches</sn> on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl>.</ab>
