<ab>in order that it gets wet everywhere; if not, wet it with a
<tl>large paintbrush</tl> dedicated to this. Then, pass through
the end of the <tl>mold</tl> which closes the <tl>circle</tl> your bit
of <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>, which holds the <m>wax</m> gate, and
cleave with it the <tl><m>clay</m> closure</tl>, as you see, &amp;
<del>it</del> place it low, so that the plant or flower touches no
thing &amp; can leave enough thickness for the <tl>mold</tl>, for the
<m>tempered sand</m> always raises the plant or flower. Thus, if it is not stiff by
itself, pass with a <tl>needle</tl> some <tl>thin thread</tl>
<del><fr>po</fr></del> on the flower to keep it from rising. Or, if you
were to forget, lower the flower with some
<del><fr>b</fr></del><comment rid="c_146r_01"/> <tl>small stick</tl> until the cast <m>sand</m> begins to
<del><fr>d</fr></del><comment rid="c_082r_02"/> thicken. Your flower being well arranged,
<del><fr>d</fr></del> choose a <tl>bowl</tl> big enough to temper in it as
much <m>sand</m> as it takes to fill your <tl>mold</tl>. Put in a little <m>sal
ammoniac water</m>, then some <m>fountain water</m>. And when
the <tl><del><fr>au en</fr></del><comment rid="c_146r_02"/> bowl</tl> is nearly full, put in, by
sprinkling, your <m>sand</m>, &amp; mix &amp; dilute it well in order that it
all becomes smooth, for if it were to coagulate, it would spoil the
<tl>mold</tl>. For flowers, it does not want to be so thick, and
especially at the beginning, you will throw, in thrusts, the clearest one
on the flower, &amp; when it will be half covered, blow strongly
everywhere, to make the little bubbles disappear. Next, finish filling
&amp; blow always. Make the <tl>mold</tl> lean a little toward its
widest part, and if you find the remains of <m>thick sand</m>, which has not
thinned well, cast it rather toward the gate than elsewhere. Finally,
you can even cast some <m>thicker tempered sand</m> in order to make <corr><del>make</del></corr> a quicker set.
I have molded thus a <pa>marigold</pa> with its leaves. The
<m><la>crocum ferri</la></m> is safer for flowers, and when there is
<m><la>crocum</la></m>, <m><tl>lute</tl></m> with the same <m>sand</m> that has served, and
is the most excellent of all.</ab>

The alloy with which I cast a large branch of <pa>marigold</pa>, which came out neatly like the natural
with its flower, its buds, and its leaves, was of one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> mixed with two
<ms>ounces</ms> of <m>lead</m>.</ab>

If there is some flashing, repair with a <tl>penknife</tl>.</ab>

Uncover the molded flower by gently undoing the <tl>mold</tl> with the
<tl>point of a knife</tl>, &amp; better yet, wet it well in
<m>water</m>. Next, use <tl>small <m><al>hog</al> bristle</m> brushes</tl>,
a bit of <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>, &amp;c. When the <tl>mold</tl> is
reheated the first time, leave it to half cool, then gently pass through
the gate an <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl> to make an opening for the burned
<m>ashes</m> inside. Next, blow inside with <tl>bellows</tl>, then
turn the <tl>mold</tl> at the gate to make everything come out, &amp;
sometimes suck and draw out with the <tl><bp>mouth</bp></tl>.</ab>

Take heed not to attach the tail of the flower too much to the gate of
<m>wax</m>, for fear of spoiling something when you pull out the gate of
<m>wax</m>. To pull it out, one needs to dig out all around a little,
&amp; then pull it with your <tl>little pincers</tl> by the tail of
<m>iron</m>.</ab>
