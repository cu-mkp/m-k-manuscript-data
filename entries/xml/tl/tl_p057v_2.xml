  One needs to make at least three layers of flesh color to accomplish
faces in
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  . And at the beginning, one puts the black and umber
where it is appropriate. Next, the

  is better than that from
  <pl>
   Flanders
  </pl>
  for in
  <pl>
   Florence
  </pl>
  the best dyes are made. To
make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest &amp; liveliest
  <m>
   lake
  </m>
  is
the best, for the kind that contains
  <m>
   purple
  </m>
  &amp;
violet, by admixture of too much
  <m>
   alum
  </m>
  , makes flesh color like
that of one who is very cold. That is why
  <md>
   ladies, wanting to color their
   <bp>
    cheeks
   </bp>
  </md>
  , grind
  <m>
   <pl>
    Florence
   </pl>
   lake
  </m>
  very finely, then
fill a little
  <tl>
   <m>
    cotton
   </m>
  </tl>
  with it, which they next
wrap in a little
  <tl>
   <m>
    fabric of
    <pl>
     Cambray
    </pl>
   </m>
  </tl>
  which is
clear. And thus they pounce the
  <m>
   lake
  </m>
  on their
  <bp>
   cheeks
  </bp>
  &amp; then, with another clean
  <tl>
   <m>
    cotton
   </m>
  </tl>
  , they
soften it.

  not entirely pure but mixed with a
