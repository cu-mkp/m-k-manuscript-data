<head>Molding <al>turtles</al></head>

<ab>This is the continuation of the second preceding leaf.<comment rid="c_146v_02"/> When you have
well uncovered the part of the belly of the <al>turtle</al>, the
underneath of the throat &amp; of the legs, &amp; having cleaned it all well,
do not forget to neatly uncover this cavity that these animals have in
their shell between the neck &amp; the shoulders. <al>Those of the
<env>water</env></al> do not have ones as deep as <al>those of the
<pl><env><fr>garrigue</fr></env></pl></al>, which are leaner. And among
these, there are some that have ones more ensconced than others. Do not
forget, therefore, to uncover all of this well to better represent its
nature. But if there is some cavity which twists too much inside and
can neither be seen nor released,</ab></div>

<div id="p146v_1" part="y" continued="yes"><ab> put in some small pieces of <m>wax</m>,
&amp; with <tl>points of hot, <m>thick iron wire</m></tl>, stretch &amp;
adapt the said <m>wax</m>. Then, <del><fr>bouch</fr></del> stuff with
<m>soft clay</m> the entrance of all its cavities. Put the
<tl><m>clay</m> circle</tl> around your <tl>mold</tl>, made already of
two pieces, which contains the back of the <al>turtle</al>. And to mold
its belly, one needs to divide in three, as you see. That is to say, you
will put an <tl><fr>entre deulx</fr> of <m>clay</m></tl> on top of the
throat &amp; another on the edge of the shell of the tail,
<mark>#</mark><comment rid="c_154v_03"/>. And having <m>oiled</m> <del>and</del> the shell of
the belly &amp; having rubbed it with <m>eau-de-vie</m>, cast your <m>sand</m>
a little thick, &amp; temper with <m>hot water</m> as before. Having set,
remove these <tl><fr>entredeulx</fr> of <m>clay</m></tl>, then uncover
well the front &amp; back legs, that is to say the part underneath &amp;
the tail &amp; the throat, &amp; remove the <m>clay</m> from the cavities
<del><fr>qu</fr></del>, all in one piece if you can, for this will show
you if this cavity will release well. And if the pulled-out <m>clay</m> brings with it the <m>wax</m> that you put there, put back it in the places
that cannot release, as is said. And if some part is taken away or let
go, attach &amp; rejoin it to the <tl>mold</tl> with some <m>wax</m>
&amp; the <tl>point of hot <m>iron</m></tl>. Do not forget to put some
<del><fr>po</fr></del> <m>melted wax</m> at the end of the nails of the
<al>turtles</al> to make the vent. Your belly shell molded <add>and uncovered</add>,
your <tl>mold</tl> can be seen thus.</ab>

<ab>Take heed to make a border of <m>melted wax</m>, with a <tl>hot
<m>iron</m></tl>, all around the edge of the top shell which is toward
the tail, in order the make the vent better. And make two little
strings of the same <m>wax</m>, <del><fr>r</fr></del> connecting from
the end the belly shell to the said edge of <m>wax</m> that is around
the shell of the spine, and make sure that <del><al>turtle</al> of</del>
the tail of the <al>turtle</al> stays between these two strings. This is
to make the vent better. This done,
<m>oil</m> your <tl>mold</tl> and what appears of the shell. Put the
<tl>circle</tl> around &amp; cast with <m>hot water</m>, as before,
observing there what you have observed. Do the same to mold the third
part, which is the tail. And having set, <del>You</del> <del>Uncover
your <tl>mold</tl></del> remove the <tl><m>clay</m> contour</tl>, clean your
<tl>mold</tl>, &amp; smooth it &amp; flatten it on all sides with a
<tl>knife</tl>, like for other <tl>molds</tl>. Dip it lightly in
<m>water</m>, then try to release it. Usually one begins
<del><fr>ment</fr></del> with <del><fr>e</fr></del><comment rid="c_017r_01"/> <del>back</del> the
back shell, <del>it is</del> that is to say, the <tl>mold</tl> on top,
which is in two halves, and this one is easier to release. The other one
follows after, but because it is neighboring the shoulder of the
<al>turtles</al>, which are deeply ensconced, it is sometimes awkward.
Thus, when moving &amp; pulling the <tl>mold</tl> gently, take heed to
pull the one which will present itself as the easiest, for one needs to
release one after the other. The most awkward of all is the one which
molds the <del><fr>e</fr></del><comment rid="c_017r_01"/> <del>of</del> throat, the
underneaths of the legs &amp; the hollow shoulder pieces, which are of
such bad release that if you had not provided for it, by filling with
<m>wax</m> before molding what does not release well, it will be awkward
for you to pull your pieces out without breaking something. But should
this happen to you, there is still a remedy, provided that you keep
<del><fr>pi</fr></del> the broken pieces.</ab></div>

<div id="p146v_1" part="y"><ab> For you can reassemble them
with <tl>points of <m>rather strong iron</m></tl> &amp; fill the crack
or fault that could be there with <m>melted wax</m> &amp; the <tl>hot
<m>iron</m></tl>, as with others, in order that the core for molding
hollow is made better. Next<lb/>
