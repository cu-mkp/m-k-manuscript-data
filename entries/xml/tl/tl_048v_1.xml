<ab>â„ž one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>antimony</m>, <ms>half a lb</ms> <m>black
soap</m>, and <ms>half a lb</ms> of <m>tartar from
<pl>Montpellier</pl></m>. Once the whole is pulverized, one needs to
boil in a <tl>varnished earthenware pot</tl> on a big fire while
stirring the whole often with a <tl>pick of <m>wood</m> or
<m>iron</m></tl>, &amp; the said <m>soap</m> will be consumed and burn
off and the rest will stay as if red, and it will be necessary
that it is reduced by <ms>a third</ms>. Then one needs to cast it on a
<tl>tile</tl> and it will turn blackish. One will need to melt this four
or five times and pour it on the <tl>flat tile</tl> and then you will
have the <m>regulus</m> drawn from <m>antimony</m>.</ab>

<ab>Others pulverize the <m>antimony</m> &amp; mix it with
<m>saltpeter</m> &amp; <m>pulverized tartar</m>, <ms>as much of one as of
the other</ms>, &amp;, having heated a <tl>pot</tl> or <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>
red hot, they put a little of it at a time, &amp; <del><fr>se</fr></del>
turn their <bp>back</bp> for fear of the <md>fumes</md>, and continue thus until
everything is put in, and strengthen the fire until everything is
thoroughly melted &amp; melt it again several times.</ab>
