<ab>Take <m>common sand</m> of <m>alum</m>, of <m>plaster</m> &amp;
<m>brick</m>, according to the composition said above. Add to it some
more <m>feather alum</m>. And mix in not quite the <ms>third
part</ms> of <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m>. However, its quantity cannot
be harmful, for it is that which receives the <m>gold</m> &amp; thanks
to which it comes out very neatly. But it were good that your
<m><la>crocum</la></m> had previously been in the
<tl><pro>glassmakerâ€™s</pro> <fr>fornaise</fr></tl>, <del>4</del><comment rid="c_120r_01"/> <ms>three <del>or 4</del>
<tmp>days</tmp> <corr><del>and</del></corr> <del>three <tmp>days</tmp></del> and three
<tmp>nights</tmp></ms>, in a <tl>flat box</tl> where it should not be very thick, so that it reheats better.</ab>

Before the invention of <m><la>crocum</la></m>, one<lb/>
would cast flowers in <m>silver</m> but not at all in <m>gold</m>. It has not been
forty <ms><tmp>years</tmp></ms> that one<lb/>
knows this in <pl>Germany</pl>.</ab>

<m>Sublimate</m> is commonly employed by <pro>goldsmiths</pro> for
<m>gold</m>. Some add <m>sulfur</m>, but they &amp; others are wrong,
for <m>sulfur</m> sours, even as it heats. And the <m>sublimate</m> is
agitated, boils, and bubbles. It is very good to clean <m>gold</m>
because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in
<m>smoke</m>. But to warm <m>gold</m> &amp; conserve its heat, there is only
the <df><m><fr>couleur</fr></m></df>, which is <m>verdet</m>, <m>sal ammoniac</m>,
<m>saltpeter</m> &amp; <m>borax</m>. This makes it run, &amp; you can
throw in a <m>branch of <pa>wormseed</pa></m>.</ab>
