  Plaster
 </m>
 for casting of
 <m>
  wax
 </m>
 <ab>
  When you want to cast in
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  in the
  <tl>
   <m>
    plaster
   </m>
   mold
  </tl>
  ,
you must know as secret that there is need for your
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  to be
in
  <m>
   hot water
  </m>
  . Never does the animal come out so neatly as in
  <m>
   metal
  </m>
  , because the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  sticks. But it is to model an
animal closest to nature
  <del>
   and
  </del>
  to repair
it afterward. One needs to smooth well away all the scales,
  <del>
   when
  </del>
  <add>
   for
  </add>
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  would enter there &amp; not release well. In molding thus
the animal, flatten down the scales for
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  &amp;, on
the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they stand up for
animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not wait for the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  to
  <del>
   a bit
  </del>
  cool completely to release it,
but do so when it is still a bit warm. When you have also molded the
first cast of the animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its
release, there is as much of it in one half of the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  as in the other. Make also strong wide gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified
when it is released, &amp; afterward you cut this off.

   Alabaster

  , is very hard but it shrinks a lot. It is very good to
make medals, but it wants to be very finely sieved.
