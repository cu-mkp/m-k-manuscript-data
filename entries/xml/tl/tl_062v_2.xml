<head>Perspective</head>

<ab>To know the point, one needs to lay down a <tl>ruler</tl> over the
lines, &amp; at the intersection<comment rid="c_062v_01"/> of these, the point will
be. Some make a hole at the end of their
<tl>rulers</tl> to fix the point by that hole &amp; move the
<tl>ruler</tl> about. Others lay down a <tl>ruler</tl> across the panel,
then on this laid-down <tl>ruler</tl> they set the <tl>tip of another
ruler</tl>, which, attached to the former by means of a <tl>screw</tl>,
moves about &amp; reaches as far as necessary without losing the point.
The <tl>ruler</tl> and <tl>compass</tl> without the <tl>judgement of the
<bp>eye</bp></tl> cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

To paint perspective in <m>oil</m>, you ought not to use a
<tl>ruler</tl>, for you would smudge everything. But when layering your
colors you need to keep to <del>the</del> &amp; follow the lines of your
first drawing.</ab>

<ab>Also, to make <tl><m>plumb</m> lines</tl>, which go from the top
<del>to make</del> <del><fr>vif</fr></del> to the bottom of the panel,
you need to have a <tl><m>thread</m></tl> with some piece of <m>lead</m>
attached to one end &amp; a little <tl>hook</tl> to the other for
hanging the said <tl><m>thread</m></tl> from the top of the panel.
