  growing again after
having been cut, or when they rebud

  , because the
new leaves are more lumpy &amp; have more apparent lineation. On the
contrary, old leaves are smooth on the inside &amp; pierced in several
places. Therefore place your leaf bottom down on the
  <tl>
   <m>
    clay

   slab

  , and secure it with
  <tl>
   small points

leaving it its natural curve. And make a notch

   in the

  to hide the stem at the first cast, which, once made

  &amp; fix it with a small mound

as you know, &amp;
