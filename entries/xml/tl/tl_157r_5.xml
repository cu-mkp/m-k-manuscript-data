<head><al>Flies</al></head>

<ab>They mold better on a single leaf than <del><fr>n</fr></del> on a
bouquet or a flower or the branch of a plant, because the single leaf
molds in two halves, which, once reheated, can open and clean well, &amp;
the cast is made better. Take heed when taking the <al>fly</al> to not
break the legs &amp; to not let it dry too much, for then the legs fall
off. And if this happens to you, <m>glue</m> with <m><al>fish</al>
glue</m> the same legs and with <m>wax</m>, or fashion some out of
<m><al>swine</al> bristle</m> or <m><mu>spinet</mu> string</m>. Fix the leaf
on the <tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl> with two <tl>points</tl>, and the
<al>fly</al> with one <tl>point</tl> in the middle of the body, &amp;
the legs with some <m>wax</m>.</ab>
