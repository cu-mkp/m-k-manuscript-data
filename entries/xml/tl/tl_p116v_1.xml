<head>Molding <al>snakes</al> <env>in all weather</env></head>

<ab><del><fr>Aulcu</fr></del> Because <tmp>in the winter</tmp> they hide
in the earth, some feed them <del><fr>des</fr></del> in quantity in
<tl>barrels filled with <m>earth</m> &amp; covered with
<m>manure</m></tl>. Others make several <tl>molds</tl> <tmp>in
summer</tmp>, because with one <al>snake</al>, you can make four or
five. And others mold lengthwise a natural <al>snake</al>,  without
it being curled, with <m>common plaster</m>, <add>reheated as said</add>
<del><fr>pu</fr></del>, <fr>en noyau</fr> &amp; in two half
<tl>molds</tl>, as said, then they cast it in <m>wax</m>. In that way
they have <al>snakes</al> that they can twist as they like, and then
they cast them in <m>metal</m>, as is said.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

If, in twisting the <al>snake</al> from <m>wax</m>, some feature becomes
undone, you can repair it by removing the protrusions from the molded
<m>wax</m>.</ab>
