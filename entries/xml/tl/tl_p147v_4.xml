  Once well heated, I cast in it
two or three

   grains, like
   <pa>
    peas

  , of
  <m>
   sal
ammoniac

  . This clarified it like a mirror. Once very white from the
force of being hot, I cast in it some
  <m>
   pulverized calamine, raw &amp;
pure
  </m>
  . I cast it in its very red
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  . It came out very neat
&amp; thin like
  <m>
   paper
  </m>
  , &amp; hollow on the reverse. But because
it had crusted, I reheated it, that is to say
reddened, let it cool, then put it to the whitening, of one

  <m>
   raw tartar
  </m>
  &amp; of one
  <ms>
   half

   common salt

well boiled, I rubbed it with a
  <tl>
   scratch-brush

  in
  <m>
   clear
water

  Usually, the

   soft latten of skillets

  becomes red from casting,
especially when it stays a
