<head>Animal after release</head>

<ab render="wide">If, by chance, you gave your <al>snake</al> such a curled shape
that the place of the belly cannot easily come out, especially
since the head &amp; the tail, which are the two ends, are
thinner, cut everything which is outside, &amp; reheat the
<tl>mold</tl> so well that what remained inside burns, then pass some
<m>quicksilver</m> inside, &amp; attracting <del>that which</del>
the <m>ashes</m> &amp; the <m>burnt bones</m> from the inside, it will
also come out, because the conduit is big, &amp; thus will not sour at
all your material. You can pull really strongly the molded
<al>snake</al>, because it is soft &amp; malleable &amp; obedient, &amp;
the <tl>mold</tl>, having set, is so firm that, because of this, the
imprint will not be spoiled. </ab>
