<ab>As the <m>wax</m> is melted, they have <m>sulfur</m> that is
melted in a <tl>spoon</tl> or <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, &amp; they pour some
in the <m>melted wax</m>. And going to the bottom or
remaining on top, the <m>sulfur</m> leaves &amp; mixes only its substance amongst the
<m>wax</m> &amp; renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the <tl>mold</tl> gently like <m>butter</m>, without leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be advised not to give it too strong a fire.</ab>
