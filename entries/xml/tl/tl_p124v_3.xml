<head>A means to make the gate for small female <al>lizards</al></head>

the end of the tail &amp; the others, that are applied in the same way,
from one <del>edge</del> <add>side</add> of the tail to the other, as
you see depicted. But take heed to make sure that with the <tl>end of
the hot <m>iron wire</m></tl>, the end of the <m>wax</m> barely touches
the animal, for the <m>sand of the second cast</m> will not touch this part.
But make sure that the end of the <m>wax</m> arranges itself only at the
edge of the empty part of the first <tl>mold</tl>. Make also conduits of
<m>wax</m> around the legs &amp; around the contours of the body which
are a little long, &amp; they will serve as feeders for the
molded thing.</ab>
