<head>Cast of <m>tin</m></head>

<ab>If the plant or flower that you want to cast <del>in <m>tin</m></del> is
delicate &amp; fine, it is necessary that the <m>tin</m> exceeds the
<m>lead</m> in the mixture, &amp; on the contrary, if it is thick, it is
necessary that the <m>lead</m> exceeds. Therefore, for the <del>mixture</del>
fine thing, put in some <m>fine tin</m>, not at all the <ms>quarter
part</ms> of <m>lead</m>. And make sure that your <tl>mold</tl> is
<sn>hottish, such that you can hold it in your
<tl><bp>hand</bp></tl></sn> when you want to cast. As for the
<m>alloyed tin</m>, the same as mentioned, it is necessary that it is
very hot &amp; almost red for casting, so that it penetrates. Otherwise,
having <add>to</add> run the length of the fine branches of
the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And do not forget to
mix in it a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>, which makes it run better
&amp; firms it up.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

In the <m>lead alloyed with tin</m>, or <m>tin alloyed with lead</m>,
you can put a little bit of <m><fr>metalline</fr></m>, &amp; it will seem
<m>silver</m>. But do not put too much, for this hardens the substance
&amp; sours it also, so that for a delicate thing like legs &amp;
similar things, it would not be appropriate.</ab>
