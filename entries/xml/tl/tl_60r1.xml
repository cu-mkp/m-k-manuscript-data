<ab>One layers two or three times with <m>chalk</m> tempered with
<m><add>distemper</add><comment rid="c_012v_01"/> glue</m> on the panel, not with a
<tl>paintbrush</tl> but with a <tl>brush</tl> in such a
way as if you wanted to pounce, &amp; leave to dry. And reiterate up to
two or three times, then even out the last ground well with a
<tl>knife</tl>, <add>then give a coat of <m>glue</m> on top</add>, upon
which you will next be able to make your imprimatura and then paint. But
make sure that your first white is not too thick for it would break
easily. <pl>Flemish</pl> <pro>painters</pro> have such panels
made by the dozen.</ab></div>
