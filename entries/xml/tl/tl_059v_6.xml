<head>Mending the cracks in a panel</head>

<ab>If a painted panel breaks you can <m>glue</m> it well on the
reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it &amp;
repair it, it ought not to be with <m>glue</m>, which rots <env>in damp
weather</env> &amp; would swell when touched with the <m>oil</m> of the
painting. But take <m>white wax</m>, which is harder than the other.
The <m>oil</m> mixed in among the <m>wax</m> prevents it from
melting <env>in the sun</env>. The <m>wax</m> ought not to be hard, but
soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks &amp; crevices with the
<tl>tip of a knife</tl>, then scrape;</ab>

<ab>and to prevent it from breaking, mix in little <m>oil</m> &amp;
melt them together &amp; fill the cracks &amp; make them even and paint
on them. And the <m>oil</m> mixed with <m>wax</m> will
<del><fr>q</fr></del> better receive color, which is also
tempered with <m>oil</m>.</ab></div>
