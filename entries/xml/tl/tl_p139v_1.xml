 Cast of

  Take some
  <m>
   white wax

than anything else because it is firmer &amp; does not leave as much
  <m>

  </m>
  , as much as you need to mold the animal that you propose,
&amp; no more, and
  <ms>
   half

   charcoal,
   <tl>
    pestled

   &amp;
finely passed through a

    <m>
     linen
    </m>
   </tl>
   or a
   <tl>
    sleeve
   </tl>

The
  <m>
   charcoal
  </m>
  gives color
  <add>
   and body
  </add>
  to the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  ,
which would otherwise be transparent &amp; the features would not be
seen as well. Therefore, put your
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  to melt in the charcoal fire. And when it will be well melted &amp; liquid, take, for a
  <ms>
   <tl>
    bowl with handles
   </tl>
  </ms>
  full of
  <m>
   melted wax

  , as much

   sulfur

    la
   </fr>
  </del>
  <ms>
   as a large
   <pa>
    walnut
   </pa>
  </ms>
  . Pulverize it, melt it over a slow fire, &amp; when
it is melted, do not leave it on the fire, because it will become
  <add>
   too
  </add>
  hard, but take it away &amp; agitate it always with a
  <tl>
   little stick
  </tl>
  , &amp; let it finish its bubbling, &amp; when it is as
liquid as
  <m>
   water
  </m>
  , throw it in the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  that you have removed
from the fire. And mix &amp; always stir the one &amp; the other, in
order that they mix well. Next, mix in, always stirring &amp; in several
goes,
  <m>
   the aforesaid pulverized charcoal
  </m>
  <corr>
   <del>
    in several
goes
   </del>
  </corr>
  . And as it will be well incorporated, take heed if
  <sn>
   your
   <m>
    wax
   </m>
   has passed its high heat, which you will recognize
   <ms>
    when it no longer
    <m>
     smokes
    </m>
   </ms>

edges, &amp; motionless &amp; close

For, if you were to cast too hot, you could not separate your
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  from the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  , &amp; it would set in the cast. When it is in
this good state, stir it with a
  <tl>
   little stick
  </tl>
  , in order that
the
  <m>
   pulverized charcoal
  </m>
  is everywhere &amp; not placed
at the bottom. And in this way, cast in your
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  , little by
little, &amp; not in one go, because the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  , by its
unctuousness, does not flow

  like other things, &amp; on this occasion, you can cast two or
three times until your
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  is full. As for the
  <tl>
   mold which
is of
   <m>
    white plaster
   </m>
  </tl>
  , pulverized &amp; reheated as for
previous
  <m>
   sands
  </m>
  , you should make it
  <tmp>
   well in advance
  </tmp>
  , for
it serves several times. But before you use it, soak it for
  <ms>
   <tmp>
    a good
hour
   </tmp>
  </ms>
  in
  <m>
   cold water
  </m>
  &amp; for

    at least

   in

    <m>
     water
     <add>
      so
     </add>
     hot
    </m>
    , that, at
the beginning, you cannot hold your
    <tl>
     <bp>
      finger

  </del>
  more,
  <del>
   thus
  </del>
  but rather that it shows
itself to be very wet everywhere, without the
  <m>
   water
  </m>
  being imbibed in it.
And, removing it from the
  <m>
   hot water
  </m>
  , closed, cast your
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  in such a state of heat as has been said. And neither the first
nor second cast come out readily until the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  is imbibed. Let it cool
before opening it, in order that the cast thing does not break. You will
recognize that the cast is good when the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  tipped out of the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  is thin and smooth. Remember to make many
gates all along the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  , in order that the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  may run
better, thus

  gate twice as large as for other
  <tl>
   molds
  </tl>
  . And if, in
the first cast, your work becomes porous and does not come out neat
  <del>
   <ill>
   </ill>
  </del>
  , it is all the same, for it is necessary that you
realise that the three or four first ones are not readily good. In the
first one, you recognize if there are some barbs, which keep from
releasing well and you remove them if they do not remove
  <add>
   themselves
  </add>
  at the second or third first casts. And the more
you will cast, the neater you will make it, and your
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  will serve
you for more than a hundred times if it is well managed. But it is
good to soak it one
  <ms>
   <tmp>
    night
   </tmp>
  </ms>
  or one
  <ms>
   <tmp>
    day
   </tmp>

  before casting in it, in order that it be well
imbibed. The same must be done for fruits of

   This
   <m>
    wax
   </m>
   is very soft &amp; amiable &amp; pliant as
   <m>
    copper
   </m>
   , and it is so strong because of the
   <m>
    sulfur
   </m>
   , which
renders it meltable much before the other, such that you can prove it on a
   <tl>
    hot
    <m>
     slate
    </m>
   </tl>
  </sn>
  . And the
  <m>
   sulfur
  </m>
  that you will have put
in it will be found, the second time that you melt it, cracked at the
bottom. Having thus passed through the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  , it does not inflame
from a
  <tl>
   candle
  </tl>
  . And on this occasion
  <del>
   that

think it will cast very neatly for medals. One uses the same
