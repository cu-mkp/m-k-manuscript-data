 Grain of
 <m>
  lead
 </m>
 <ab>
  Take a
  <del>
   pierced
  </del>
  <tl>
   playing card
  </tl>
  , pierced with a
  <tl>
   pin
  </tl>
  or
  <tl>
   needle
  </tl>
  , folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small
  <tl>
   cleft stick
  </tl>
  and, holding the said
  <tl>
   stick
  </tl>
  by
  <del>
   one end
  </del>
  <add>
   the other
  </add>
  end,
put your
  <tl>
   card
  </tl>
  three or 4
  <ms>
   <bp>
    fingers
   </bp>
  </ms>
  away from
the
  <m>
   water
  </m>
  that you will have put in a
  <tl>
   dish
  </tl>
  or similar
  <tl>
   vessel
  </tl>
  . Then pour your
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  , which should not be too
hot, into the
  <tl>
   card
  </tl>
  &amp; continually tap on the
  <tl>
   stick
  </tl>
  that holds it. And thus your
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  will granulate itself roundly.
And pass it through a coarse
  <tl>
   sieve
  </tl>
  to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The largeish one will reach 25 to 30
  <ms>
   paces
  </ms>
