  Varnish
 </m>
 <ab>
  To a
  <ms>
   half lb
  </ms>
  of
  <m>
   <pa>
    spike lavender
   </pa>
   oil
  </m>
  , put in
4
  <ms>
   â„¥
  </ms>
  of
  <m>
   sandarac
  </m>
  &amp;
  <m>
   mastic subtly pulverized
  </m>
  . 
And first, boil your
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  in a
  <tl>
   pot
  </tl>
  on a
  <tl>
   chafing dish
  </tl>
  , and then mix in little
  <add>
   by
little
  </add>
  the aforesaid
  <m>
   gums
  </m>
  , stirring continually with a
  <tl>
   small stick split and quartered at the tip
  </tl>
  , &amp; when you do
not collect
  <m>
   gum
  </m>
  with the tip, that is to say that it is totally
melted &amp; that your
  <m>
   varnish
  </m>
  is done. And to render it clearer,
put in a small lump of
  <m>
   camphor
  </m>
  to decoct. It is true that
with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the
  <m>
   <pa>
    spike
lavender
   </pa>
   oil
  </m>
  be good, clear &amp; not fatty, otherwise
your
  <m>
   varnish
  </m>
  would be worth nothing. You can test it,
  <del>
   <fr>
    d
   </fr>
  </del>
  soaking some
  <m>
   paper
  </m>
  in it &amp; heating
it. If the
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  , which will evaporate, leaves the
  <m>
   paper
  </m>
  clean, without
  <del>
   being
  </del>
  a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is
fatty.
