<ab>Take some <m>â˜¿ sublimate of <pl>Venice</pl></m>,
true &amp; not <m>arsenic sublimate</m>, a <ms>pea</ms>, <m><la>aes

Pulverize everything separately, &amp; next mix everything in a
<tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl> &amp; put on <m>hot ash</m>. You will see
that everything dissolves like <m>wax</m>, making many colors. Let it
<del>everything</del> set &amp; put a little of it on each

<pro>Founders of large casts for statues</pro> throw in much
<m>tartar</m> to clean it of its <m>filth</m> &amp; <m>nastiness</m>,
&amp; much <m>sal ammoniac</m> to render it thin &amp; neat. And when
they want to cast, they put in much <m>tin</m>. The <env>cold &amp;
humidity</env> strongly disagrees with it, which renders dangerous the
work of the <pro>founder</pro>, for one only needs a <env><po>spring</po> of
<m>water</m> in the pit</env> to lose everything.</ab>
