<ab>One prepares the <wp>guards</wp> thoroughly with a <tl>soft, very soft, file</tl> such that there
is nothing black<comment rid="c_097r_04"/> left on any of the <wp>guards</wp>, and next heats them,
&amp; passes them as is said.<comment rid="c_097r_05"/> But to gild
&amp; gild with <m>silver</m>, they ought not to pass more than a little
 beyond blue. Then, while the <wp>guards</wp> are hot, one attaches them to a <tl><oc>vise</oc></tl>,
&amp; with some <tl>tweezers</tl>, one layers the <m>gold</m>, &amp; one
sets it with <m>bloodstone</m> that is quite clean &amp; rubbed with
<m>putty</m>. And when the <wp>guards</wp> are cold, one reheats them,
then one layers the <m>gold</m> as above. And first, one gives
<del>of</del> two layers, until the entire <wp>guard</wp> is well-garnished. And
next, one reheats as at the beginning, &amp; one gives the third covering
of <m>gold</m>. Then, one burnishes very thoroughly &amp; with great
force with a large <m>bloodstone</m>. <del>And</del> But note that
<add>for</add> burnishing well, the <wp>guard</wp> always needs to be warm. And to
know this, <sn>one smells it &amp; brings it close to the
<bp>nose</bp></sn>. For one ought not to touch it with the
<bp>fingers</bp>, but one <del>holds it on</del> lifts it from on top of
the warm <m>ashes</m> with a small <tl><m>iron</m> rod</tl>, which has
been purposely made to go into the eye of the <wp>guard</wp>. And when it is
completely well-burnished, one rubs it very well with a <tl><m>white
linen cloth</m></tl>, and the <m>gold</m> needs to be thicker &amp;
stronger than for <pro>painters</pro>. A <ms><fr>quarteron</fr></ms> is worth
fifty or lx <cn>sous</cn>.</ab>
