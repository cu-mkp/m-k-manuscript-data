<ab>Since then, I have molded with <m>burnt bone</m>, <m>iron dross</m>
&amp; <m>burned felt</m>, thoroughly pulverized &amp; ground finely on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl> and well mixed together. I moistened them very
well with <m>beaten glair of egg</m>. And having covered the medal with it,
as in the others, then filled the <tl>frame</tl> with <m>sand from the
<env>mine</env></m>, I knocked moderately. I found it to be of very good
release &amp; molded very neatly. I let it sit an entire <ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms>. The <tmp>next morning</tmp>, I reheated
it little by little, over the course of seven or eight
<ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> (<emph>for if possible, no humidity ought to
remain</emph> in the <tl>frame</tl>). I cast twice in <m>copper</m>
alloyed with <m>☾</m>, as <cn><m>old
K</m></cn>.<comment rid="c_086v_03"/> The substance
turned out very beautiful, shiny &amp; <sn>sonorous</sn>, &amp; without a
crust, and my <m>sand</m> was not corrupted at all. Since then, I
have cast with it several casts of <m>soft lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>
that came out better &amp; more neatly than any other that I have ever
found.</ab>

<ab>When you mold, make certain lines around your <tl>mold</tl>, in the
<tl>frame</tl>, in order to attract the substance to all sides, in this
way.</ab>

<ab><m>Potin of syringe</m> &amp; other
<del><fr>co</fr></del> works runs even better than <m>fine latten</m>.
But I think that it is better <ms>half</ms> <m>copper</m> &amp;
<ms>half</ms> <m>latten</m>, which have been used &amp; have been in
very thin works, such as skillets &amp; other similar things. I have
seen this mixture of <ms>half</ms> and <ms>half</ms> come out well.</ab>

<ab>To mold well, one ought to cast in a big <tl>frame</tl> several
medals together, for when there is a lot of substance &amp; the
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> is almost full, it heats more, &amp; then, if one
medal does not come out well, the other will be good.</ab>

<ab>It is better to melt in a <tl>bellows furnace</tl> than in a
<tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl>, because it gives a more vigorous heat. It
is true that <m>latten</m> melts well in the <tl><fr>four à
vent</fr></tl>, because it is easier to melt than <m>copper</m>, being
more brittle.</ab>

<ab>Some <emph><pro>founders</pro></emph> have this superstition,
that only <tmp>three days a week</tmp> are good for melting, namely
<tmp>Tuesdays</tmp>, <del><tmp>Wednesdays</tmp></del>
<tmp>Thursdays</tmp>, and <tmp>Saturdays</tmp>. The others, for them,
are unlucky.</ab>

<ab>When you mold, do not knock excessively on the medal, which is in
the <m>sand</m>, because it prevents it from releasing very neatly &amp;
shakes loose the <tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

<ab>Take heed also that the <m>sand</m> does not surpass the edges of the
<tl>frame</tl>, for it makes the molded medal higher than the cast,
&amp; in this way, <m>metal</m> will never enter the mold. Therefore,
always make sure that the surface of your cast object <add>sur</add>passes the <tl>mold</tl> in a straight line, and to do this, if it seems good to you, put a
piece of <tl><m><fr>carton</fr></m></tl> of whatever thickness you
please.</ab>

<ab><emph><pro>Founders</pro></emph>, in order to prevent their large cast
works from becoming porous, are careful to reheat their molds very well. And
to know if they have been reheated sufficiently, they knock against it with
their <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, &amp; if they start to <sn>ring</sn> like a pot,
then they are sufficiently reheated.</ab>

<ab><emph>To cast their <wp>cannons</wp> neatly, they</emph> mix their <m>earth</m>
with some <m>fine casting sand</m>, if they can find any.<hr/></ab>
