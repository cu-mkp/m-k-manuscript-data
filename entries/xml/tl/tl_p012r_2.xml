<ab>The <m><df><fr>terre chimol&#233;e</fr></df></m>, otherwise known as
<m><pro><oc>fuller</oc></pro>&#8217;s earth</m>, with which they dress the
<m>cloth</m>, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; &amp; if you
want to reheat it, it must first be warm, &amp; reheat it on a gentle
fire at a distance &amp; little by little, otherwise it would crack.
Put the figure to reheat in a <tl>pot</tl> in an <tl>oven</tl> or in a
<tl>covered oven</tl>. It is very soft, neat &amp; beautiful. You
can make a hollow form of animals from <m><fr>chimol&#233;e</fr></m> &amp; cast
<m>lead</m> in it.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> before you reheat
it. When you mold &amp; make a hollow form from <m><fr>chimol&#233;e</fr></m>, do
not press suddenly, but gently, for it would crack.</ab>
