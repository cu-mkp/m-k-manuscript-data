<ab>It comes undone in <m>water</m> &amp; thus cannot be molded 
<fr>en noyau</fr>, but one casts the <al>spider</al> and then one draws the
drawn threads between the grass that they make <env>in the fields</env>
on some <tl><m><fr>quarton</fr></m></tl> with a <tl>point</tl>. One makes
around it an <tl>edge of <m>paper</m></tl>, glued to the
<m><fr>quarton</fr></m> &amp; one casts with <m>tin, very little
alloyed with lead</m>.</ab>
