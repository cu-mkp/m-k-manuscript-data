<head><m>Sand</m></head>

<ab>One can find an excellent one <env>on the little hill</env> of
<pl>Puy David</pl><comment rid="c_081r_01"/> near <pl>Thoulouse</pl>
for <m>lead</m>, <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>copper</m>. It does not want to be
too much reheated because, drying out all at once, it loses its
bond &amp; burns at the first arrival of <m>metal</m>, which makes
the work lumpy &amp; not neat. It is better to reheat from a distance,
rather than with a <m>straw</m> flame, which generates
<del>some</del> some <m>filth</m>. Before filling in the <tl>frame</tl>, you can put in the <m>finest sand you have</m> in a <tl>very fine
<m>linen</m></tl>, &amp; dry pounce the medal and then the <m>moistened sand</m>
that you put on top, which has more body, will grip it.</ab>

<m>Fixed mercury</m> mixed in when one wants to cast, makes
<del><m>metal</m></del> <m>lead</m> run. But if it is pure, one ought to cast
very hot so that it runs. And vents.</ab>
