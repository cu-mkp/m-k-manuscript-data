<head>Casting in <m>copper</m> </head>

<ab>It is necessary that the <tl>frame</tl> be quite even &amp; that
it fits well also on the <tl>board</tl> where it is set, so that it holds
firm &amp; does not shift when one molds. It is necessary that the <m>sand</m>
be clean &amp; well chosen and well reheated, &amp; pulverized very
finely on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, for the one that you want to put
first on the medal, and that you press strongly when molding. Guard against
<m>oiling</m> your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly
and reheat well, &amp; let cool. Moisten your <m>sand</m> with <m>wine boiled
with <pa>elm</pa> root</m>, and cast <m>latten</m> which comes out well /
namely from the <m>substance of the <fr>trebuschets</fr></m> and similar
thin things. Make your gate broad &amp; even if it is barely thick, it
will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the <tl>mold</tl>. Cast
from the foot of the medal, in order that the face, further away from the
heat, comes out better &amp; more relieved from the violent heat. And if
your <tl>frame</tl> does not have vents, make some
<del><fr>qu</fr></del> in the <m>sand</m>, which come from the edges<comment rid="c_072r_01"/> 
of the piece, to go into the gate. Cast very hot, which you
will recognize when you throw a little reserved substance in that
which is already well melted, &amp; if it melts quickly, this is a sign
it is <del><fr>fo</fr></del> quite hot. At that time, invigorate the heat
of your <tl>furnace</tl> with <tl>bellows</tl> of the right size,
keeping the mouth of the <tl>furnace</tl> well covered with some large
<del><fr>cuivr</fr></del> <tl><m>tile</m></tl> or other similar thing,
which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take
your red-hot <tl>pincers</tl> &amp; the <tl>crooked
<m>iron</m></tl> as well, to clean the <m>charcoals</m> which are in
your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a <tl><m>latten</m>
wirebrush</tl>. The <m>grindings from sharpening large scissors &amp;
large knives</m> is very good for <m>copper</m>.</ab>
