<head><m>Gold</m> cast very thinly</head>

<ab>When <pro>goldsmiths</pro> have something to <m>solder</m> promptly
and do not have leisure to <tl>forge</tl> it, they melt some
<m>gold</m> and then throw it on a <tl><m>cloth</m></tl> or other
<tl>things that withstand the fire</tl>, and they flatten it immediately
with a <tl>hammer</tl> or similar thing. And it ends up very thin &amp;
even receives the impression of the <tl><m>cloth</m></tl>.</ab>

<ab><emph><m>Fine gold</m></emph>, not alloyed, can be cast in medals,
but not in plants &amp; <al>lizards</al> &amp; very fine things if it
is not alloyed.</ab>

<ab>A <pa>pansy</pa> anointed with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m> can be cast
in <m>alloyed gold</m>.</ab>

<ab>And other thin leaves, but only if the branch is not too big and
the leaves, separately cast, can be <m>soldered</m>.</ab>
