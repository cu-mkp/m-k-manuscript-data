<head><m>Plaster</m> alone</head>

<ab>Reheated <m>stone plaster</m> <del>fears</del> is undone in
<m>water</m>, but that which is <del>reheated &amp;</del> first
pulverized and then reheated does not fear it. But if it is good, it
hardens in it, like <m>the one of <pl>Paris</pl> &amp;
<pl>Spain</pl></m>, which is hard in <m>stone</m>, as is that which
grows in <env>lean &amp; dry earth</env> and which seems like 
<m>white salt</m>. <pl>Germans</pl> make statues for their <env>fountains</env>
with it, which are not spoiled, especially once varnished, but it hardens in <m>water</m>. When it is alone &amp; not mixed, it sets more quickly than otherwise. One needs to <m>oil</m> very lightly
your <tl>molds</tl> that are of <m>metal</m> or <m>stone</m>, otherwise it would
not release. And however you <m>oil</m>, you have to temper it with <m>hot
water</m>. And when it has set &amp; well cooled, one
needs to wet it sometimes in <m>cold water</m>, but if it refuses to
open, in <m>hot water</m> &amp; sometimes in <m>boiling water</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


Sometimes one even needs to make the <tl>mold</tl> boil in <m>hot
water</m>, as when you have molded some <m>wax</m> that you fear would
not be easily released from it.<hr/></ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

<m>Cold water</m> makes <m>oil</m> withdraw to the surface of the
<m>plaster</m> that has sucked it in, &amp; thus it releases.</ab>
