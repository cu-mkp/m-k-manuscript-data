<head><comment rid="c_158r_01"/>That any <m>sand</m> can be rendered good</head>

<ab><pro>Artisans who work in large works</pro> &amp; who need to further
their profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she
does not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time they would
use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing <m>sands</m>, seek
<m>the one of the <del><fr>s</fr></del> <env>mine</env><del>s</del></m>,
which is not too fatty, the one that is a kin of <m>earth</m>, not too lean &amp;
consequently without bond, but rather that which is pulled <env>from the
depths of the sand-bed</env> in bricks &amp; clods that show
its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which
has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found <sn>soft
when handling it between the <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl></sn>. And
because the latter is only found <env>near the rocks in mountainous
areas</env> or <env>lean territories</env>, &amp; akin to the 
<m><fr>arene</fr></m>, it cannot be found <del>in</del> <env>in the
surroundings of all the <pl><fr>bonnes villes</fr></pl></env><comment rid="c_028v_02"/> where
<pro>artisans</pro> willingly gather. And thus, if they do
not have it <env>close to their house</env>, they prefer to have it come
from afar, like from <pl>Lyon</pl>, <pl>Venice</pl>, <pl>Paris near the
Sainct Chappelle</pl> &amp; similar places, rather than prepare it.
However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the
<m>sand from a <env>mine</env></m></ab>

<ab>good &amp; proper for molding. For if it is coarse, pass it through a
<tl>sieve</tl>, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, &amp; when
the <m>water</m> has rested a little, empty that which is still
troubled in some separate <tl>vessel</tl>. The coarse will promptly 
fall down to the bottom of the first <tl>vessel</tl>, but the one which
will have come from the troubled <m>water</m>, set apart, having
settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough
bond, grind it quite dry on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, &amp; you will
render it impalpable, &amp; which will have bond like <m>chalk</m>.
Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it &amp; again will grind it &amp; mix it with <m>salts</m>, or <m>linen, <add>or</add> burnt
felt</m>, or <m>ashes of paper</m> &amp; similarly washed things.</ab>
