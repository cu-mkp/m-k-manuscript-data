<head>Tempering <m>sand for <tl>molds</tl> of flat medals</m></head>

<ab>Flat medals of <m>wax</m> or <m>metal</m> are <m>oiled</m> very
lightly &amp; then are touched with a <tl>paintbrush</tl> with
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. And in order that the <tl>mold</tl>, wetted with
<m>water</m>, takes without refusing the <m>oiled</m> thing, one heats
the <m>water</m> well for tempering the <m>sand</m>, for with <m>cold water</m>
it would refuse. Medals are <m>oiled</m> because they are not malleable
&amp; thus could break the <tl>mold</tl>. And animals, which are
malleable, do not want to be <m>oiled</m>. <m>Hot water</m> should be
<ms><sn>of such heat that you cannot hold your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>
there without feeling strong heat</sn></ms>. Temper your <m>sand</m> thicker for flat medals &amp; solids than for <al>lizards</al> &amp; fine things.
Your <m>sand</m> having set, clean &amp; scrape your <tl>mold</tl> on one side
&amp; the other, &amp; make a notch at the foot &amp; the border of the
medal on the side of the gate, in order that you can take it away
better. Lower also <add>the <tl>mold</tl>, scraping</add> the 
medal all around, in order that, from all sides, you can take it away
without it corrupting the <tl>mold</tl>. Next, make your scorings around
<del>of the</del> the first <tl>mold</tl> cast <del><fr>mes</fr></del>,
in order that the second cast joins with it without varying, &amp;
especially make a notch at the bottom of the <tl>mold</tl>
where the head of the molded thing is. Make some also at the sides of
the gate. This done, dip the reverse of the first <tl>mold</tl> in
<m>water</m>, <m>oil</m> it, &amp; thus it will not be imbibed. Rub
the reverse of the medal with <m>eau-de-vie</m> &amp; secondly cast,
tempering in <m>hot water</m>. If you have molded a medal <fr>en noyau</fr>, 
having made the first cast &amp; this one having set,
outline, with the <tl>point of a knife</tl>, the surround of the medal,
in order that it is raised on the cast &amp; not buried in it. Then
having made the second cast &amp; having opened your <tl>mold</tl>,
<del>have</del> take away the medal in one go, with <del>one</del> two
<tl>knife points</tl> <del><fr>q</fr></del>, and that one takes it from
the side of the gate &amp; the other from the side of the head, which is
opposite.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Take care not to <m>oil</m> your medal too much, for if the <m>oil</m>
seeps out, it diverts the <m>sand</m> from becoming smooth &amp; amassing, &amp;
makes it wavy &amp; lumpy. One should only touch the middle of the medal
<del>of the <fr>p</fr></del><comment rid="c_137v_01"/> with the <tl>point of an <m>oiled</m>
paintbrush</tl>, &amp; then spread the <m>oil</m> everywhere.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Make especially sure that the gate is the widest you can
<del><fr>p</fr></del> toward the medal &amp; embraces it well, that the
entrance of the gate is ample, always narrowing toward the medal. Do
not forget also to notch the entrance of the gate.</ab>

<ab>If you want to cast <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>copper</m>, or
<m>latten</m>, it is necessary that they be perfectly red &amp;
inflamed on the inside when you cast, &amp; perfectly reheated two
times if there is something inside to be burnt &amp; cleaned.</ab>

<ab>The <tl>molds</tl> of animals that one burns must be heated in
such a way that the animal burns. But if it has <m>thick bones</m>, it is
troublesome to pull out &amp; <m>☿</m> often breaks
some fine things by its weightiness. One does not put
<m>☿</m> in <tl>molds</tl> that can open. This readily
happens with flowers, the <tl>mold</tl> of these does not open because
they are made all in one go.</ab>

<ab>When you want to reheat your <tl>molds</tl>, put the <tl>clamps</tl>
on the joints, in order that, when reheating, they do not bend,
contract, or break. This is done after the gate is made.</ab>

<ab>The <m>scrapings of the mold</m> can still be used, using them in
place of <m>brick</m>, after having reheated them, &amp; also the
<m>pieces of the molds that have been used</m>. One <m><tl>lutes</tl></m> with it
also important things, like works of <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m>. One
also reheats it, &amp; prepares it with <del><fr>se</fr></del> <m>sal 
ammoniac water</m>, as <m><de>spat</de><comment rid="c_108r_02"/> from <pl>Germany</pl></m>, &amp; it is
<m>excellent sand</m> for <tl>frames</tl> for all <m>metals</m>.</ab>

<ab>The <tl>molds</tl> of things which one needs to burn inside the mold are
<del><fr>souf</fr></del> not opened until the thing that is inside is
burnt, like with <tl>molds</tl> of <al>crayfish</al>, <al>crabs</al>,
<al>stag beetles</al>, portraits &amp; pieces of <m>sulfured
black wax</m>, which do not release well.</ab>

<ab>One ought not to mold on <m>brick</m> or <m>wood</m> because they
<del><fr>l’ea</fr></del> drink &amp; attract <m>water</m> too soon, and
do not allow the <m>sand</m> to set. It would never be better than on a
<tl><m>fresh clay</m> slab</tl>. Yet, I have experienced that <m>grey
earth</m> dries the <tl>mold</tl> too soon. <m>The yellow</m> is
better.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

For medals and flat things it is necessary that the <m>sand</m> be thick
enough wet, because it sets quickly. And when the <m>sand</m> is thus thick,
one can hit and shake the <tl>table</tl> where the <tl>mold</tl> is
placed, to make it run everywhere. But when the <m>sand</m> is thin, like for
flowers and plants, one ought not to hit, nor when there is something
attached with <m>wax</m> or another thing that is subject to coming off,
like <al>crayfish</al> legs or similar things. And if the <m>sand</m> is, by
chance, too thick, you promptly put in it some
<corr><del>pour</del></corr> <m>water</m>. Having put the <m>sand</m> in
<m>water</m>, <del>it</del> examine that it is thick at the bottom &amp;
thin on top. The thinnest is cast at the beginning, and then blow,
&amp; the thickest at the end in order to fortify the
<tl>mold</tl>.</ab>
