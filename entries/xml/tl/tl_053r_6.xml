<head>Casting of <m>lead</m> and <m>copper</m></head>

<ab><m>Lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> come out well in <m>white chalk</m> but
the softer it is the better. <m>The one from <pl>Champaigne</pl></m> fetches
the price that is set in <pl>Lyon</pl>. <m>Burnt &amp; calcined
<al>horse</al> bones</m> mold very neatly.</ab>

I believe that the<lb/>
<m>marrow from the horns<lb/>
of <al>oxen</al></m> or<lb/>
<m><al>sheep</al></m>, that is to say, the <m>spongy bone</m> from the inside,<lb/>
molds very neatly and is better than <m>bone</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="right-bottom">

Note that any <m>brittle metal comes out better than the fatty</m>. Also,
<m>lean sand</m> receives &amp; drinks it better than the
<m>dense one</m>.</ab>
