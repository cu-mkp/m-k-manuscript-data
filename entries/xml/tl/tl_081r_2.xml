<head><m>Earth</m> for molding</head>

<ab><m><pro>Tanner</pro>â€™s earth, or the one with which
<pro>potters</pro> make a whitening on pots</m> to make <m>lead</m> run
better on them &amp; to prevent the <m>lead</m> from being absorbed into
them, is very good for molding the hollow forms of things you want make in
relief. It releases better than <m>plaster</m> or <m>sulfur</m> which
become hard once they have set. For the <m>earth</m> being ready, one
ought to beat it hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very
large you can mold it in several parts. If you reheat it, it is
necessary that it be over a closed fire. One finds this <m>earth</m> at
<pl>Fosseret</pl><comment rid="c_081r_02"/> &amp; in another place
called <pl>Ox</pl>.<comment rid="c_081r_03"/></ab>
