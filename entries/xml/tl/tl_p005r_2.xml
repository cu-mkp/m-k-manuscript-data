 Concave mirrors
 <ab>
  The concave mirror composed in the aforesaid form produces an
endless number of pretty conceits which seem magic. If someone wants to see
oneself from behind, it is necessary to place the
  <tl>
   concave
mirror
  </tl>
  on the ground on its foot, &amp; let it be at a slant;
next,
  <add>
   look
  </add>
  at it from one
  <ms>
   pace
  </ms>
  away. But if you
look at it close up, it will represent you the right way up but
with your
  <bp>
   face
  </bp>
  quite large &amp; the
  <bp>
   hairs of your
beard
  </bp>
  as thick as
 </ab>
</div>

<div categories="practical optics" continues="yes" id="p005r_2">
 <ab>
  string &amp; will represent a
  <bp>
   nipple
  </bp>
  as large as a plate, and
  <pro>
   women
  </pro>
  can see the
  <bp>
   secret places
  </bp>
  that they do not
want to show to
  <pro>
   surgeons
  </pro>
  . It casts the representation out of
itself, and if you
  <sn>
   touch
  </sn>
  <del>
   the place
  </del>
  the eye of
the representation with your
  <bp>
   finger
  </bp>
  , another
  <bp>
   finger
  </bp>
  will come against yours.

  You will make a light
  <tmp>
   at night
  </tmp>
  for someone quite far
away, if you place the
  <tl>
   concave mirror
  </tl>
  behind a
  <tl>
   candle
  </tl>
  placed on the
  <tl>
   <env>
    window
   </env>
  </tl>
  . You will be able to read and write quite
far from the
  <tl>
   candle
  </tl>
  if you place it behind the
  <tl>
   candle
  </tl>
  &amp; place
  <add>
   &amp; turn
  </add>
  the concavity toward you. If you put
the
  <tl>
   mirror
  </tl>
  <ms>
   at the end of a
   <tl>
    table
   </tl>
  </ms>
  &amp; a
  <tl>
   candle
  </tl>
  on it, it will represent two lights on the
  <tl>
   table
  </tl>
  for you. To see what is happening on a
  <env>
   street
  </env>
  ,
shutter the
  <env>
   window
  </env>
  , whereby the more of it you can shut the
better it will be. Make a hole at the lower one, as wide as your
  <ms>
   <bp>
    little
finger
   </bp>
  </ms>
  , perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
place a
  <tl>
   sheet of
   <m>
    paper
   </m>
  </tl>
  on the
  <tl>
   <env>
    window
   </env>
  </tl>
  &amp; let the
  <ms>
   middle of the
   <tl>
    sheet
   </tl>
  </ms>
  be over the hole.
Pierce the
  <tl>
   sheet
  </tl>
  in the same place as the hole &amp; the same
size. After, place the concave face of the
  <tl>
   mirror
  </tl>
  toward the
hole, &amp; it will represent to you all those who pass by in the
  <env>
   street
  </env>
  on the
  <tl>
   sheet of
   <m>
    paper
   </m>
  </tl>
  . Similarly with
the
  <env>
   pierced door of a closed room
  </env>
  . You can make wavy ones
&amp; triangular ones, in the fashion that
  <pn>
   Ptolemy

  describes, &amp;

  The concave one also sets fire to
  <m>
   straw
  </m>
  from
quite far away, and lights a
  <tl>
   <m>
    candle
   </m>
  </tl>
  with the
  <env>
   sun
  </env>
  . Also, 
it heats through the reverberation of fire.
