<ab><m>flour</m>. And to flatten it, take a <tl>small stick of
<m><pa>boxwood</pa></m></tl>, very round &amp; of the same thickness
everywhere, which has, at the two ends, a little circle, more raised
than the rest, to give the necessary thickness to the <m>paste</m>. And
then, with this <tl>rolling pin</tl>, flatten it in such a way that it
is delicate &amp; thin enough. Then apply it on the hollow
of your <tl>mold</tl> and press on it with some <tl><m>cotton</m></tl>
&amp; your figure will imprint itself in the <m>paste</m>, in relief on
one side &amp; in a hollow form on the other. This done, anoint with a
<tl>paintbrush</tl>, wetted in a little <m>melted butter</m>, the
part of the <m>paste</m> which is hollow. Then, cut the
excess <corr><del><fr>r</fr></del></corr> <m>paste</m> which surpasses the hollow of the
<tl>mold</tl> <del><fr>H</fr></del>. Anoint your <tl>mold</tl> also with
<m><pa>olive</pa> oil</m>, as you have done with others, place the
<tl><m>clay</m> contour</tl> &amp; cast <del><fr>s</fr></del> your
second <tl>mold</tl>. And you will have your medal as thin &amp; hollow on one
side as you will want. You can have diverse <tl>rolling pins</tl>, which will
have ends, some more raised than others, to make various thicknesses, or
use <tl><m>sheets of lead &amp; copper</m></tl> of various thicknesses
or of <tl><m><fr>carton</fr></m></tl>, cut with the <tl>rolling
pin</tl>.</ab>

If you were to rub your <m>paste</m> with <m>oil</m>, it would drink the
<m>oil</m> &amp; penetrate up to the <tl>mold</tl>, which it would
attack. But <m>butter</m> remains on the surface of the <m>paste</m>
&amp; is not imbibed at all. You should not, on these reverse sides,
temper your <m>sand</m> with <m>hot water</m>, for it would melt<lb/>
