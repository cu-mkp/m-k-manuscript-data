<ab>If your <tl>retort</tl> is well <m><tl>luted</tl></m>, you ought not to surround it
with <tl><m>ashes</m></tl>, which would only get in the way of chasing
the <m>spirits</m> properly. But when, at the end, you give it violent
fire, surround it with chacoals which should be lit elsewhere beforehand,
as those in the <tl>furnace</tl> should be, in order that they do not
crackle &amp; do not make <m>smoke</m>. Put the said lit charcoals around the body
of the <tl>retort</tl>, &amp; not close to the neck, which does not need
to be heated as vigorously. The <tl>top grate</tl>, where you set your
<tl>retort</tl>, is sufficiently far, one <ms><fr>dour</fr></ms> or
<ms>half a <bp>foot</bp></ms>, from the <tl>bottom grate</tl> where the
charcoal is placed, for by doing this not as much of it is
wasted.</ab></div>
