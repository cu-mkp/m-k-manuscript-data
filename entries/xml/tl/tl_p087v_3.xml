<head><m>Sand from the <env>mine</env> of <pl>Thoulouse</pl></m></head>

<ab> <m>Casting sand coming from the <env>mine</env></m>, once passed through a
<tl>double sieve</tl>, next put in with <m>melted resin</m>, burns &amp;
inflames &amp; becomes all red &amp; inflamed like <m>iron</m>. Once
cold, it is completely black and can be ground very finely on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Having prepared it thus &amp; rendered it
without asperity on the <tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl>, I moistened it
with <m>beaten glair of egg</m> &amp; beat it well, until it was not pasty
but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, &amp; molded with
it in <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> very neatly, but it wants to be well
reheated &amp; at ease.</ab>

<ab>Others beat it well in a <tl>mortar</tl>, in small amounts at a
time, &amp; thus it is <po>pressed together</po> and rendered very fine. Then
they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Next, they grind it dry on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. And thus it becomes as if impalpable and not
too dried out, <del>it</del> and it retains the body &amp; the bond of the
<m>earth</m> to which it is kin and is better than when it is so
burnt. Once moistened with <m>glair of egg passed through a
<tl>sponge</tl></m>, it releases <del>very neatly <fr>M</fr></del> very
neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore,
since then, I have experimented <del><fr>lexper</fr></del> with
moistening it only with very strong <m>vinegar</m>. It released a
figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that,
moistening the finest in a fashion as with <m>glair</m>, &amp; the
coarsest, for filling, with gushes of <m>salt water</m> or
<m>wine</m>, that they do not join so well. But as they are of one
nature &amp; are moistened the same, they embrace each other &amp; hold
together one with the other.</ab>

<ab>
<emph>For molding well</emph>, after having prepared your <m>sands</m>, mold <tmp>in
a day</tmp>. Slowly reheat them <tmp>the next day</tmp>, then cast them
on another.

One ought to choose the one which is <del>as</del> in clods
&amp; lumps, well <env>deep in the earth</env>, for usually the one that
is found <env>higher up</env> is too much a kin of the <m>earth</m>, and the lower is a kin of the <m>rock</m>.<comment rid="c_087v_01"/></ab>

I have molded it from <m>pure lead</m> cast very <del>neatly</del> hot, &amp; I had as an example the very neat principal,<comment rid="c_137r_03"/> but the
<m>vinegar</m> hardly gives it any bond, &amp; thus it sustained only
one cast. </ab>
