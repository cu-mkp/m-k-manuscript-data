<head>For casting in <m>sulfur</m></head>

<ab>

To cast neatly in <m>sulfur</m>, arrange the <m>bread pith</m> under the
<tl>brazier</tl>, as you know. Mold in it what you want &amp; let dry,
&amp; you will have very neat work.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


Try <m>sulfur</m> passed through <m>melted wax</m>, because it no longer
inflames &amp; no longer makes eyelets.</ab>
