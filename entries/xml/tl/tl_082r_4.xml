<ab>To divide the teeth of their cogwheels proportionately, they do not
use a <tl>compass</tl>, for there is none so fine that it can
<tl>compass</tl> <ms>distances as small as those of the small
cogwheels</ms>. But they make a platform (as they call it)
of <m>latten</m> <del><fr>fais</fr></del> divided into several circles,
&amp; each circle is divided <del><fr>d</fr></del>into<comment rid="c_082r_02"/> <ms>equal distances</ms> marked by a
point, and each circle has a certain number of them, for example one 30,
another 36, another 40, &amp;c. Then, on the pierced center of the
platform, they set the small cogwheel there, and on the
center of the cogwheel a flat line or alidade which is moved to the
circle with the number that you want to mark on your cogwheel. Then they
mark a line on the cogwheel with a <tl>sharp point</tl>, then move the alidade
to the following point, &amp; continue to mark thus. And to mark the
points on the circles of their platform, they divide the
circle into three &amp; then divide this <ms>third part into as many
distances as is necessary with regard to the total division of the
circle</ms>, &amp; make in this manner their division &amp; distribution
of the teeth as fine as they please.</ab>
