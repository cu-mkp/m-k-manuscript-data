<head>Painting plants of <m>metal</m></head>

<ab>If you are in a hurry, it would be better to mix your color with a
not-too-thick <m>gum</m> <del>or</del> because <m>oil</m> takes a
<tmp>long time</tmp> to dry and runs if it is layered thinly,
as the plants require. And if you still want it <add>done</add> promptly,
temper your color with <m>glair</m> beaten with <m>peelings of the <pa>fig tree</pa></m>, 
and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
thinly.</ab>
