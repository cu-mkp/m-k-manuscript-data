It can be gathered from the words of <pn>Herodotus</pn><comment rid="c_001r_71"/> that the
navigation of the <pl>Portuguese</pl> was not newly invented by them, as
they brag. At the beginning of the first book entitled <el>Clio</el>,<comment rid="c_162r_08"/> he
says that the <pl>Phoenicians</pl> would come from the <pl>Red Sea</pl>
by continuous navigation to the <pl>coast of Greece</pl>, mainly to
<pl>Argos</pl>, to which they would carry merchandise from
<pl>Egypt</pl> &amp; from <pl>Assyria</pl>, which they usually sold out
of within 6 <tmp>days</tmp>.<comment rid="c_162r_01"/></ab>
