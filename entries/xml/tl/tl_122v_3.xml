, which embraces the medal well. For the other way, with legs, is only
done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, <add>which is
wide and in one piece</add>, works better for flat medals. But take heed
that all gates be very thin close to the medal &amp; almost not as thick
as the medal, if it is not very thin like <m>paper</m>. And then, from
the medal toward the gate, thicken it as it goes, for it comes out better
thus. If the gate is thick at the entry to the medal, the work will
never come out well. Make sure that <del><fr>desp</fr></del> it is moderately 
thick from the half of the gate at the top, &amp; from the same
half at the bottom very thin. Do not forget to make grooves at
<del><fr>au hau</fr></del> the top of the gate to prevent that the
<m>metal</m> runs furiously.</ab>
