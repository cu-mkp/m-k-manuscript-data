<ab>Kitchen pots are made well, in order not to give a <sn>bad taste to
the food</sn>, with the same <m><fr>metal</fr><comment rid="c_016v_05"/> the bells are made of</m>. It is
true that <pro>foun<del><fr>ables</fr></del><add>ders</add></pro> mix in
more <m>latten</m> to make them yellower, to make them more vendable.
But the <m>latten</m> by itself, &amp; at a mere touch, is
<sn>stinking</sn> &amp; of <sn>bad odor</sn>.</ab>

<ab><m>Latten</m> does not lose, or only slightly, its <m>calamine</m>
in an <tl><fr>four &#224; vent</fr></tl> when it is melted in a <tl>crucible</tl>, nor
in a <tl><m>wood</m> furnace</tl>, but it does in a
<tl>bellows furnace</tl> because <tl>bellows</tl> give violent fire.</ab>
