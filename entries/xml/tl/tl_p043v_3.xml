<ab>For firing your <wp>arquebus</wp> precisely, it is necessary that the end
of the breech be &amp; come precisely to the edge of the touch-hole,
because in this manner the <m>powder</m>, without blowing, catches &amp;
burns all at once &amp; has more force &amp; does not push back. On the
contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the
<m>powder</m> catches sooner in this place, makes it push back, &amp;
blows, which a <wp>chambered arquebus</wp><comment rid="c_043v_01"/> clearly
shows, which pushes back more than another. And since the barrel is
thicker at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for
that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. And then, the
thickness of the barrel gains about one <ms>line</ms> over the caliber,
and the sight another. It would therefore be necessary to either
make the barrel all of one thickness or to raise the stock <del>on</del> at
the end &amp; toward the muzzle, &amp; sink it in &amp; lower it
toward the breech.<comment rid="c_043v_02"/> The weight of the
<m>powder</m> must be the third part of the ball.
