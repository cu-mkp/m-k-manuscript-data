<head>Cast of <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m></head>

<ab>Because <m>tin</m> wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal,
plant, or other thing for molding is <del><fr>espe</fr></del> thin &amp;
fine, do it so that there is more <m>tin</m>, much more than
<m>lead</m>, namely less than the <ms>fourth part <m>lead</m> for three
parts <m>tin</m></ms>. And still, one puts <m>lead</m> only to form an
alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong &amp;
thick, put<comment rid="c_110v_03"/> a lot more <m>lead</m> in than <m>tin</m>. And in one &amp;
the other you can put a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>, but only a
little, with a little <m>rosin</m>, when you want to cast. <add>Since
then, when molding with <m>fine and new lead</m>, I put into one
<ms>lb</ms> two <ms>ounces</ms> of <m>fine tin</m>. And when molding
with <m>fine tin</m>, I put in two <ms>â„¥</ms> of <m>fine lead</m>
for one <ms>lb</ms>. I made plants &amp; <al>snakes</al> just like
nature.</add></ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

I cast <m>tin</m> almost red, and <m>lead</m> the same, which, however,
had not remained in the fire for too long, for it becomes brittle and
calcines.</ab>
