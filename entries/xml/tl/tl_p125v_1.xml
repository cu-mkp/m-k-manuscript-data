<head><al>Vipers</al> and <al>snakes</al></head>

<ab>

I molded a <al>viper</al>, which, for casting, is more appropriate than
any other <al>snake</al> because it has scales beautiful &amp; very
visible on all the body &amp; principally on the head and under the
throat. It has a flat head, the snout reddish, tending toward
incarnadine, &amp; snubbed like the <al>horned asp</al> or like
<del>a</del> the top of a <al>pig</al>'s snout, big jowls, the
eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open, where it
<add>has</add> double canine teeth on each side, all coming out of a
strip of flesh that covers and clothes them. It also has, in the throat,
a tube of flesh, made like a <al>dog</al>'s penis, from which comes its
stinger. Other <al>snakes</al> have a double row of teeth.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


If you want <del>cut</del> <del>the</del> to mold the <al>snakes</al>
with the mouth open, you must cut off the head &amp; leave it inside, for
it will not be released.</ab>
