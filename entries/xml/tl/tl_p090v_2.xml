 <ab>
  In
  <pl>
   Italy
  </pl>
  , those who are in the colder regions, like
  <pl>
   Lombardy
  </pl>
  , make
  <tl>
   square wooden cases
  </tl>
  , a little larger at
the bottom than at the top, and  affix
  <tl>
   buckles
  </tl>
  on its
sides for transporting them with
  <tl>
   straps
  </tl>
  , as one carries gout
sufferers, because the wheels with which one could make them roll spoil
the pathways of the
  <env>
   gardens
  </env>
  . And
  <ms>
   <tmp>
    every two
years
   </tmp>
  </ms>
  , they do not forget to open the sides of the
  <tl>
   cases
  </tl>
  for trimming &amp; dexterously cutting, with the soil,
the ends of the
  <pa>
   orange tree
  </pa>
  â€™s roots, because otherwise, as they
find the wood, they contract &amp; fold back on themselves &amp; dry at
the tips &amp; would make the tree die. But as they are trimmed, it
preserves for them new space
  <del>
   <fr>
    cos
   </fr>
  </del>
  for expanding,
without finding resistance from the wood that hinders them. And know
that, for this effect, it would be better to join the sides of the
  <tl>
   cases
  </tl>
  with
  <tl>
   screws
  </tl>
  &amp; not with
  <tl>
   nails
  </tl>
  , in
order to not shake the
  <m>
   soil
  </m>
  when one opens them.
