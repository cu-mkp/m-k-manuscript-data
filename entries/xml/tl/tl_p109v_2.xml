 Killing
 <al>
  snakes
 </al>
 for molding
 <ab>
  Some put a
  <ms>
   drop
  </ms>
  of
  <m>
   aquafortis
  </m>
  in the mouth,
which stuns them well, such that the head &amp; the part behind
seem to be dead but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it
with a
  <tl>
   needle
  </tl>
  to fit it to the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  , it moves &amp;
spoils &amp; undoes everything. Therefore, to put them to death entirely, put it
in a
  <tl>
   bottle
  </tl>
  of
  <m>
   good vinegar
  </m>
  &amp; some
  <m>
   eau-de-vie
  </m>
  . And do thus with
  <al>
   lizards
  </al>
  &amp; other similar
beasts.

 <ab margin="left-middle">
  If you want to keep them, you can put them in a
  <tl>
   pipe
  </tl>
  full of
  <m>
   earth
  </m>
  <env>
   in a garden outdoors
  </env>
  . But your
  <tl>
   pipe
  </tl>
  must be covered with
  <tl>
   <m>
    archal wire
   </m>
  </tl>
  , for otherwise it would
climb &amp; go up very high.
