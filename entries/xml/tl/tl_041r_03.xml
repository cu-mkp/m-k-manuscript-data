<head><m>Sand</m></head>

<ab>The <m>sand</m> <del>cast</del> for casting should be chosen neither so
lean that it has no hold, nor too fatty. And although it is found
<env>in nature</env>, it is nonetheless not everywhere. And if you
are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with
<m>fatty earth</m>, for the <m>sand</m> does not want it at all, for it makes
it very porous. But you can give it bond with <m>brick thoroughly
ground</m> on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, or <m>plaster</m> or <m>calcined
alabaster</m> or something similar, or the <m>burned marrow of
<al>ox</al> horn</m> or <m>burned <fr>aspalte</fr></m> throughout. If you grind it quite
finely on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, it <del><fr>s</fr></del> acquires
hold &amp; then you can burn it with <m><fr>aspalte</fr></m> or mix
it with a <ms>quarter part</ms> of <m>tripoli</m>. Guard against
<m>bread</m> falling into your <m>sand</m> because it makes it very
porous.</ab>
