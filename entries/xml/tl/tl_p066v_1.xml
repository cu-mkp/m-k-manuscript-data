<ab>Take large <m>loaves of bread freshly drawn from the
<tl>oven</tl></m> &amp; split them <ms>in half</ms> &amp;, as hot as may
be done, apply them <del>&amp; they</del> &amp; do this 3 <ms>times a
<tmp>day</tmp></ms>, &amp; continue 4 or 5 <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>.
Next, make a plaster with <m><pl>Venice</pl> turpentine</m> or better,
<m>common turpentine</m>. Mix in <m><pa>sumac</pa></m>,
<m><pa>blackthorn sloes</pa></m>, <m><pa>quince</pa> seeds</m>,
<m><pa>pomegranate</pa> flowers</m>, <m><pa>olive tree</pa> leaves</m>,
&amp; the like, decocted, &amp; mix with the <m>turpentine</m>. But, I
forgot, one needs, after having applied the <m>hot bread</m>, which
<md>softens</md> &amp; <md>makes one sweat</md>, to put on <tl>linen cloths soaked with <m>water
from a honey bee hive</m></tl>, that is to say <m>honey</m> &amp;
<m>wax</m> extracted all together from the <oc>honeycomb</oc>.</ab>
