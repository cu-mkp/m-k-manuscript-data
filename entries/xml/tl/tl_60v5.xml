<head>Work of the <pl>Flemish</pl></head>

<ab>They do all their works in <m>oil</m> with the <tl>tip of the
paintbrushes</tl>, in <del><fr>f</fr></del> the fashion of good
<pro>illuminators</pro>, and grind their colors very finely, protect
against dust, and often clean from their <tl>paintbrush</tl> the
bits of <m>hair</m> which they sometimes leave there, for if these
should remain on the work <del>it this</del>, it would prevent neat
working, which they are very careful about. In this way their work
appears very soft, especially in small work, in which one needs to apply
more diligence because one looks at them more closely. They
usually finish the forehead, then the eyes, next the nose,
finally the mouth and the rest. But they do not proceed like some others
who <del><fr>fo</fr></del> layer two or three different flesh colors, one
yellowish &amp; the other darker, because the colors always mix &amp;
finally die. They simply <del><ill/></del> make their imprimatura
properly,</ab>
