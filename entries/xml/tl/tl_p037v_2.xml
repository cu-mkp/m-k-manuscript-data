  Some do not apply
  <m>
   <fr>
    gris d’escaille
   </fr>
  </m>
  to the
  <m>
   glass
  </m>
  for painting on glass, but trace on the
  <m>
   clean
glass
  </m>
  with
  <m>
   <fr>
    noir à huile

  </m>
  . But it is very necessary that the
  <m>
   wood
  </m>
  <comment rid="c_037v_02">
  </comment>
  be rid of
  <m>
   grease
  </m>
  , for if it has
  <m>
   grease
  </m>
  , however little, the color will not take on it at all. And likewise, if the
  <pro>
   glassworker
  </pro>
  who is working has a
  <sn>
   stench
  </sn>
  from his
  <bp>
   nose
  </bp>
  or his
  <bp>
   mouth

  ,
  <del>
   the
  </del>
  &amp; he
  <bp>
   breathes
  </bp>
  on the
  <m>
   glass
  </m>
  , the color will not take on it.
Those who discovered the invention of working in small works of soft
  <m>
   enamels
  </m>
  use only
  <m>
   <fr>
    esmail d’azur
   </fr>
  </m>
  , which is blue,
&amp;
  <m>
   <fr>
    esmail colombin
   </fr>
  </m>
  , which is the color of purple,
which they soften with
  <m>
   rocaille

As for the yellow, they make it from
  <m>
   silver
  </m>
  , the red from
  <m>
   sanguine
  </m>
  , as is said elsewhere, the black &amp; gray &amp;
shadows with
  <m>
   <fr>
    noir d’escaille
   </fr>
  </m>
  , either strong or weak,
the flesh color with
  <m>
   clear sanguine
  </m>
  . The green is made first
from yellow, then on top they coat
  <m>
   <fr>
    esmail d’azur
   </fr>
  </m>
  , either
strong or weak, according to whether they want to make it bright or
dark.
