<ab><m>Fine gold</m> is opposed to it, for <del><ill/></del> on it, it
remains yellowish. But alloyed <m>gold</m> is more appropriate for it,
such as that of <cn>Ã©cu</cn> &amp; <cn>pistolet</cn>. <del>If</del>
<m>Gold</m> <del><fr>f</fr></del> <del>is not put back on the fire</del>, with its
own pale color, renders the <m>enamel</m> a dead color.
<del><fr>Ma</fr></del> And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back
on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the <m>enamels</m>
beautiful. <add>Otherwise, they are matte.</add></ab>

<ab>There is <m>rouge clair</m> which, once it is used with the
<m><fr>arene</fr></m>, loses its beauty.</ab>

<ab>Some can be found that have <m>grains of gold</m> inside, and it is
also the opinion of good <pro>goldsmiths</pro> that the good one is made
with <m>gold</m>.</ab>
