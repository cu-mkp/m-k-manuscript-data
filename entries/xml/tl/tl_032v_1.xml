<ab>They make two kinds of them in <pl>Toulouse</pl>, one to hang on the
<env>partition walls of rooms</env>, which they weave almost as fine as
the <m>straw</m> <del><fr>p</fr></del>hats worn by <pro>villagers</pro>. And
they make them in long bands, some the <ms>width of ten
<del><fr>b</fr></del> <m>straws</m></ms>, others of thirteen. And they
work on them mainly <ms><tmp>in summer</tmp></ms>. And <ms><tmp>in
winter</tmp></ms>, when they put it to use, they sew it. But beforehand,
they put it in <m>dye</m> and commonly make it in three colors, green,
red, and sometimes violet. The green one is made in a single 
<m><pa>pastel woad</pa> dye</m>, because green being made from yellow and blue, the
<m><pa>pastel woad</pa></m> discharging itself onto the <m>straw</m>,
which shows its dark yellow, one obtains bright green. For the red, they
use <m>alum</m> and <m><pa>brazilwood</pa></m>. For the violet, they use
<m><pa>pastel woad</pa></m> &amp; a little <m>copperas</m>, which
browns the blue with its black <m>tint</m>.</ab>
