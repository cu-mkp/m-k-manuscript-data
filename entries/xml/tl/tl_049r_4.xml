<ab>They put into one <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, which renders the <m>tin</m>
thicker. There are two kinds of <m>tin</m>, one of them nearly like
<m>lead</m>, which runs better, the other brittle, which becomes
thicker. They cast in solid &amp; thick <tl><m>tin</m> molds</tl> or, to
do it more neatly, in <tl><m>copper</m> molds engraved with a
<tl>burin</tl>, or in <m>stone</m>, or in <m>earth</m></tl>. Since
<m>latten</m> scraps, mixed in, only render the <m>tin</m> more
breakable &amp; harder &amp; difficult to work with, they cast
<add>in</add> their very hot <tl>molds</tl> <del>&amp; almost <fr>roug</fr></del> &amp;
with very hot <m>tin</m>. They fumigate their <tl><m>tin</m> molds</tl> with
<tl><m>resin candles</m></tl>.</ab>

<ab><m>Brittle <del><fr>dou</fr></del> tin</m> is found mixed into
<fr>saulmons</fr>,<comment rid="c_028v_04"/> easy to cut, but difficult to put to use &amp; melt
if it is not mixed with the other soft one. And without this,
it would become waste.</ab>
