<ab>One finds <m>sapphires</m> that one calls <df>of the trellis</df>, because they are pierced and it is said that a
certain <pro>king</pro> had made from these a certain ornament in the
shape of a trellis, as would perhaps be the Screen of 
<pn>Charlemagne</pn>,<comment rid="c_038r_02"/> as it is called, in the treasure of <pl>Saint Denis</pl>, in which the <m>gemstones</m> are
mounted without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one
side &amp; the other, &amp; to show their vividness. I have a white one <corr><del>one</del></corr>
that seems to be rough &amp; pierced, and is spotted all over with blue
blemishes. I am of the opinion that these are artificial &amp; that they
are of <m>taffer</m> or <m>very clear <fr>esmail azur&#233;</fr></m>
melted entirely on the <m>sapphire</m>. <add>The <tl>file</tl> bites on it
as on the <m>beryl</m>.</add></ab>
