<head><m>Topaz</m></head>

<ab>The same <ms>dose</ms> is observed for all <m>gemstones</m>, namely
<ms>one weight of <m>calcined pebbles</m> on three of
<m>minium</m></ms>, <tl>pestling</tl> all separately in a
<tl><m>copper</m> mortar</tl> for <m>emerald</m> &amp; in an
<tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl> for making <m>topaz</m> or <m>amber</m>
color, with <tl>pestles</tl> identical to the <tl>mortars</tl>. The
<m>emerald</m> &amp; the <m>topaz</m> are of the same heat, &amp; for an
<ms><tmp>hour &amp; a half</tmp></ms> on the fire, for they could burn.
The <m>ruby</m> <del><fr>en</fr></del> wants more time &amp; more fire
&amp; colored with <m>gold leaf</m>. I believe that <m>pumice stone</m>
or <m>firestone</m> for the <m>ruby</m> would be better. See the
<m>enamels</m>. Try also mixing, in place of <m>pebbles</m>, pieces of
<m>colored glass</m> or <m>enamels</m>. If the mass is not colored
enough, <tl>pestle</tl> it more in the <tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl>.</ab>

<m>Slightly burnt tartar</m> mixed among this makes beautiful yellow,
but one hardly needs any. The <m><fr>arene</fr></m> also makes it
more yellow.</ab>
