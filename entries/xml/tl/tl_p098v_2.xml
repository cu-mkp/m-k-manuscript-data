<head>Salted <pa>artichokes</pa></head>

<ab>One puts them whole &amp; not too ripe in a <tl>firkin</tl> that one
fills with <m>brine</m>. Then, one serves them <ms><tmp>all
year</tmp></ms> among salads, raw with <m>oil</m> &amp; <m>vinegar</m>,
for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test
your <m>brine</m> with an <m>egg</m>, for if it is good &amp; strong
enough, the <m>egg</m> will float on top. If not, it is not strong
enough and would not preserve the <m>fruits</m>.</ab>
