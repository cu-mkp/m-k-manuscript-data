  Take a
  <tl>
   <oc>
    funnel
   </oc>
  </tl>
  or
  <tl>
   funnel of
   <m>
    <fr>
     fer blanc
    </fr>
   </m>
  </tl>
  which is double-walled in the body
  <del>
   <fr>
    d
   </fr>
  </del>
  but not in the spout. Make a small hole at the top edge &amp;
  <del>
   <fr>
    au
   </fr>
  </del>
  another, slightly bigger, on the inner wall that
will be a little above the spout, just as you can see in the adjacent
example. Then when you want to use it, put in
  <m>
   wine
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   liquid rosette of Brazilwood
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   <pa>
    black cherry
   </pa>
   juice
  </m>
  , and blocking the hole of the spout
  <del>
   the
  </del>
  with your
  <bp>
   little finger
  </bp>
  , make sure that the
  <tl>
   <oc>
    funnel
   </oc>
  </tl>
  is well
filled in order that the
  <m>
   wine
  </m>
  can enter
  <del>
   there
  </del>
  between the
double walls through the hole at the side, &amp; if it does not enter
well, making it seem as if you are
  <sn>
   tasting
  </sn>
  the
  <m>
   wine
  </m>
  ,
suck &amp; draw in a little
  <m>
   air
  </m>
  , drinking where the little hole
is. Next, make one of the close
  <pro>
   bystanders
  </pro>
  drink the rest of
the
  <m>
   wine
  </m>
  or cast it aside or let it flow through the tip, but
before, you must have pressed your
  <bp>
   thumb
  </bp>
  well over the hole on
the top edge, because in this way, by the compression of
  <m>
   air
  </m>
  , the
  <m>
   wine
  </m>
  will be retained between the double walls. Then with a
  <tl>
   bodkin rounded at the tip &amp; that goes into its handle
  </tl>
  , you
make it seem as if you pierce the
  <bp>
   forehead
  </bp>
  of someone who holds
a
  <tl>
   <m>
    glass
   </m>
  </tl>
  in his
  <bp>
   hand
  </bp>
  , and while you pierce, you
cover what you are doing with the
  <tl>
   <oc>
    funnel
   </oc>
  </tl>
  that you hold
close to

  his
  <bp>
   forehead
  </bp>
  . Then removing your
  <bp>
   thumb
  </bp>
  from over the
hole on the top edge, the
  <m>
   air
  </m>
  , being free, will make the
  <m>
   wine
  </m>
  issue from between the double walls through the hole marked
B, &amp; fall through the tip marked C into the
  <tl>
   <m>
    glass
   </m>
  </tl>
  .
But you must make the
  <pro>
   fellow
  </pro>
  bend his
  <bp>
   head
  </bp>
  enough in
order to do it well.
