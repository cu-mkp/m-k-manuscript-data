<head><m>Sal ammoniac</m> and <m>iron dross</m></head>

<ab>I have pulverized <m>sal ammoniac</m>, dried well in the fire &amp;
in a hot <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>, and passed it through the
<tl>double sieve</tl>; it became very fine. But to render it even more
delicate, I have ground it dry on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Then, I mixed
it with <m>pulverized &amp; finely ground iron dross</m>, in the same
way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief without being
moistened <env>in the <tmp><fr>serain</fr></tmp></env>, or in the
<env>cellar</env>, or otherwise with the <tl>napkin</tl>, &amp; it
releases very neatly.</ab>
