  Candles

 <ab>
  They keep well in
  <m>
   bran
  </m>
  which makes them white &amp;
long-lasting, so say some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep
them in a
  <env>
   cool &amp; dry place
  </env>
  , in such manner that they are
not pressed together. It is better if there is a
  <m>
   <pa>
    hemp
   </pa>
   thread
  </m>
  throughout the wick, which gives it more light &amp; makes the wick hold up
straighter. Otherwise, if it is all of
  <m>
   cotton
  </m>
  , as those of
  <pl>
   Montauban
  </pl>
  make, it is necessary to snuff it out often, for
after it has burnt
  <del>
   <fr>
    il
   </fr>
  </del>
  a little, the
  <m>
   cotton
  </m>
  droops &amp; makes the
  <tl>
   candle
  </tl>
  drip.
