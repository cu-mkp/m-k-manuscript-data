   <m>
    Good tin
   </m>
  </df>
  is that which is hard as
  <m>
   silver
  </m>
  &amp; soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
  <m>
   tin
  </m>
  &amp; alloyed as is said.

 <ab>
  <m>
   Looking-glass tin
  </m>
  must not be
  <del>
   <m>
    smoked
   </m>
  </del>
  mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.
 </ab>
 <ab>
  Nor must the forms be
  <m>
   smoked
  </m>
  until then.
 </ab>
 <ab>
  If the
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  shrinks in the
  <tl>
   frame
  </tl>
  , this means that it must
be reheated &amp; reddened on the fire.

  Good

   sand

  , when moistened, does not stick at all to the
  <tl>
   <bp>
    hand

  when pressed.

  The
  <m>
   perfect sand for the

  is
  <m>
   <fr>
    aspalt

  that the cast must be thin &amp; hardly thick
in order that it does not overtax the material, and must not
exceed the

   the width of a

  ; likewise for
  <m>
   tin

  , which wants to be cast
very thinly. For
  <m>
   lead

the vents very large &amp; deep either.

  <m>
   sand that you use for the

reheating it several times, it must be corrupt from its nature &amp; no longer fit to make a hold &amp; to mold
