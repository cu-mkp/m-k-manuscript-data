<head><m>Amber</m></head>

<ab>The orangeish color that is in <m>transparent amber</m> and in the
other one that has body is not internal, for on the inside it is
whitish. But through age <del>it</del> or wearing it, it acquires this
reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the <tl>file</tl> or on
the <tl>wheel</tl> do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But
they only polish it, rubbing it with a <tl><m><pa>willow</pa></m>
stick</tl> or other <tl><m>soft wood</m></tl> dipped into <m>water</m> &amp;
dusted with <tl><m>tripoli of <pl>Brittany</pl></m></tl>, and it takes a
beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow &amp; you want to intensify
its color, hang it inside a <env>chimney</env> where there is much
<m>soot</m> &amp; <m>smoke</m>, and it will take on a reddish-orange
color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under
<m>dung</m> to turn it green, like <m>bones</m>. Or <m>smoke</m> it
<env>in a closed space</env>, with the <m>smoke of <fr>safre</fr></m> or
<m>manganese</m> &amp; other <m>drugs</m> that you know. Or in
<m><bp>urine</bp></m> &amp; <m>distilled vinegar</m> mixed with colors, or in the
<m>vapor of aquafortis</m> boiling in <m>copper</m>, or
<m>aquafortis</m> boiling with <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>sal
ammoniac</m>. &amp; some cut <m>amber</m> in facets on a <tl>wheel
of <m>soft wood</m></tl> with <tl><m>putty</m></tl> instead of
<tl><m>emery</m></tl>, &amp; <m>jet</m> also. The <m>salt called by the <pl>English</pl> <df><fr>de armonic</fr></df></m> is a <m>mineral salt</m> that resembles <m>marble stone</m> and is a very hard mineral with large pieces, like that of <pl>Cardona</pl> &amp; <pl>Monserrat</pl>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



I have experimented by making it boil in <m>lye</m> or <m>corrosive
water</m>, it turns reddish on the surface. And if it is rubbed against
<m><pa>fir</pa></m> &amp; <m>soft wood</m> before it is cooled, it is
easily cut.</ab>
