<head>Animals with hair and fragile and very thin flowers</head>

<ab>Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hair is raised
&amp; is represented as though mixed up &amp; <del><fr>to</fr></del> clumped
together. Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative
&amp; that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is
<m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, with which you will anoint it. Once cast, you
will be able to repair it. The bodies of <al>butterflies</al> and
plants that have a stem &amp; leaves which are wooly with a certain
capricious &amp; downy hair, also need to be anointed with the same
<m>oil</m>, to keep this down flat; likewise flowers that have
very delicate &amp; thin leaves, for dry <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m> makes
them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called
<pa><df>dandelion</df></pa><comment rid="c_124r_01"/> or a <pa>pappus</pa>, which comes from the
seeds of <pa>burdock</pa> &amp; flies away at the slightest sigh of
<env>wind</env>.</ab>
