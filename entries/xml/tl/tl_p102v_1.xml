<head>Painting on <m>crystal</m> or <m>glass</m></head>

<ab>They paint in <m>oil</m> without lines, except for the faces where
they trace the nose &amp; the mouth with black in small work, then they
make strokes &amp; highlights in white, next they coat all with
flesh color. And as for the ground, they make it with <m><fr>azur d'<pl>Acre</pl></fr></m> 
for more beauty, or with <m>lake</m> for a quickly-done red, 
or with <m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m> for the most beauty. But
one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even &amp; of
one color, &amp; thus for other colors. Next, they put underneath it a
<m>foil backing for <m>topaz</m>, or one of <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m></m>.</ab>
