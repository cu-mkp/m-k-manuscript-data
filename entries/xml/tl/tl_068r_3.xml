<head>Casting</head>

<ab>I have tried four kinds of <m>sand</m> for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>:
<m>chalk</m>, <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m>, <m>tripoli</m> &amp; <m>burnt
linen</m>, all 4 excellent. But as for the <m>chalk</m>, it needs to
be of the softest kind you can find, like <m>the <pl>Champagne</pl> one
that <pro>painters</pro> use</m>. It releases very neatly, does not want
to be moistened with <m><fr>magistra</fr></m> or anything else, but needs to be
completely dry, in its natural state, finely
pulverized. The first cast is always the
neatest; however, it will well withstand two or three. But there is only
the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake
your <tl>frame mold</tl> to take new <m>powdered chalk</m> that has not
yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the <tl>frame</tl> has
dried out &amp; does not have as much hold &amp; bond like the fresh one.
<m><tl>Pestled</tl> glass</m> can be made from <m>common glass sand</m>, however,
<m><fr>cristallin</fr></m> is more excellent, for common glass contains
<del><m>glass</m></del> <m>salt of saltwort</m> only, but
<m><fr>cristallin</fr></m> contains both <m>salt of tartar</m> &amp;
<m>saltwort</m> all together, which both help fusion, the <m>glass</m>
once calcined &amp; reduced as if to its prime substance. In order to
calcine it perfectly, throw your pieces of <m>glass</m>, whichever it be,
among the largest possible lit <m>charcoals</m> that you can, if you are
    lacking another amenity <del><fr>t</fr></del>for<comment rid="c_068r_04"/> violent fire<del><fr>t</fr></del>.<comment rid="c_068r_03"/>
And when it is well red, throw it into
<m>water</m></ab>

<ab>and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your
<tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> and easily <tl>pestle</tl> in a <tl>mortar of <m><fr>metal</fr></m>,<comment rid="c_016v_05"/> 
or better yet, of <m>iron</m></tl>. Next, it
will be easy to grind it, not <del>only</del> on <m>common
<tl>marble</tl></m> <add>that would corrode</add>, but on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, and it is necessary that it be finely ground
<add>with <m>water</m></add> so that when putting it on your
<tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl>, you find it soft without any asperity, like
the <del><fr>p</fr></del><comment rid="c_068v_01"/> colors that the <pro>painters</pro> grind for <m>oil</m>. This one, once dry, you can
use <del><fr>au lie</fr></del> instead of <m>sand</m>, in a <tl>frame</tl> 
without moistening it with anything nor reheating it, if you do
not want to; fumigate the hollow form with <m>sulfur smoke</m> or
<del>of <fr>p</fr></del> with the tip of the flame of a <tl><m>wax candle</m></tl>
that barely makes <m>smoke</m>, and it will make a very neat &amp; shiny &amp;
polished work, in <m><add>pure</add> lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>. I would
say the same for <m>finely pulverized tripoli</m> that does not want to
be <del>not</del> reheated or moistened. <m>Burnt linen</m> gives less
trouble than any other, because it needs neither to be reheated nor to be
moistened, &amp; molds <add>and releases</add> very neatly <del>&amp;
very</del>, subtly &amp; <del>releases well</del> neatly, like the
previous ones do as well, &amp; withstands several fusions. First one ought to burn
it with a flame, then leave it to rest &amp; to be consumed with its
fire until it wears it out, then finely grind it on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl> or on a <tl><m>paper</m></tl>. <del>But because a

lot</del> And if you reheat it in a <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, red hot due to
the fire, to render all of it fine &amp; impalpable, I believe it will
be even better. But because a lot of <m>linen</m> is reduced to very
little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
medal that you want to mold &amp; cover it, and fill the <tl>frame</tl> with <m><tl>pestled</tl> slate</m>, which molds also very neatly. But
note that the first cast is always the most beautiful &amp; the neatest.
If you cast opportunely, <m>soft tin</m> that seems to be
burnished in little wheels that <pro>pewterers</pro> sell, comes out
very neatly &amp; approaching the color of <m>silver</m>, without mixing
in anything. It is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &amp;
so that the molded object should be 4 <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> away
from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well,
<del>with such a <ms>degree of heat</ms></del> <add>so hot</add> that it
promptly burns in a shiver a <tl><m>paper</m></tl> or <tl><m>straw</m></tl> placed

rest a little &amp; cast. <m>Tin</m> mixed
