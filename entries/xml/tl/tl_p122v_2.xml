<head>Molding hollow</head>

<ab><m>Wax</m> on its own cools too quickly &amp; does not run well
everywhere, &amp; <m>tallow</m> keeps its heat well &amp; runs
everywhere, but on its own it is not good. But when <m>wax</m> &amp;
<m>tallow</m> are mixed, the work is all the better. <al>Crayfish</al> &amp;
other small animals can easily be molded hollow for the body, but as for
the legs, it will be awkward.</ab>

The first part of the <tl>mold</tl>, that is, the first cast on the
<tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl>, cracks more readily in the fire than the
second.</ab>
