<head>Double layers</head>

<ab>The <pl>Flemish</pl> &amp; those who paint panels by the dozen only
make one layer &amp; finish at the first go, but the colors soon die.
And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer
them lightly &amp; not very thick, to soften them well.</ab>
