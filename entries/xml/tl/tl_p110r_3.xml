<head><al>Snakes</al></head>

<ab>When they feel taken, they hardly bite &amp; do not have the power
to harm, unless they are really big <al>snakes</al>. The main thing is
to keep from being bitten before catching them, and having put your
<tl><bp>foot</bp></tl> on top of it, as close to the neck as one can,
one needs to grab it closest to the head, for it cannot bite if it does
not have the means to stretch its neck &amp; make a sinuous &amp;
oblique turn, &amp; it cannot <del><fr>s</fr></del> harm with a direct
attack, since he cannot move forward in a direct line, but writhes in
the shape of an S. I saw that <pro>the one who taught me to <tl>mold</tl>
them</pro> did not take this into account, &amp; assured me that there
was no trick to it, other than, when taking it, he would pull it, a
little pressed &amp; held tightly by the neck, &amp; passing it under a
shoe, he would flatten it in such a way that it would render
<del>under</del> from its bottom, which is five to six <corr><del><fr>t</fr></del></corr>
<ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> from the end of its tail, all nasty and
venomous things that it had in its belly, and that after this, it does
not have the strength to bite, and if by chance it should bite or expel
through its bottom some <m>filth</m>, he would only dig the
<env><m>earth</m></env> with a <tl>knife</tl>, &amp; bury his
<bp>hand</bp> in <env><m>fresh &amp; humid earth</m></env>, which, when
applied fresh <del><fr>en</fr></del> on the <md>infected part</md>,
pulls out all the venom and nothing else. It is the same with
<al>toad</al>â€™s venom, which I have seen experimented. </ab>

In three,<comment rid="c_110r_03"/> it is almost as thin as it will be afterward if it does not eat.
<tl>Molding</tl> it very soon after it is caught is best, before it becomes thin. One
ought to put it to death only a <ms><tmp>quarter of an hour</tmp></ms> before you want
to <tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

<ab>When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it renders it up.
And if, after having eaten something, it is thus pressed
<tl><bp>underfoot</bp></tl>, this pains it greatly &amp; hurts it. If it
is wounded, it will not eat willingly.</ab></div>
