 Molding

 <ab>
  It is a matter different from the casting of
  <al>
   snakes
  </al>
  , &amp;
plants, and flowers because the cavities that are between the two shells
require several pieces. They are molded in

   plaster

  to be cast in
  <m>
   sugar
  </m>
  without making a gate as do all things that you
want.
