<tl>sieve</tl>, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, &amp; when
the <m>water</m> has rested a little, empty that which is still
troubled in some separate <tl>vessel</tl>. The coarse will promptly 
fall down to the bottom of the first <tl>vessel</tl>, but the one which
will have come from the troubled <m>water</m>, set apart, having

bond, grind it quite dry on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, &amp; you will
render it impalpable, &amp; which will have bond like <m>chalk</m>.
Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it &amp; again will grind it &amp; mix it with <m>salts</m>, or <m>linen, <add>or</add> burnt
felt</m>, or <m>ashes of paper</m> &amp; similarly washed things.</ab>
