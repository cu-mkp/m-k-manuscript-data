 For removing flashing and barbs from things molded
 <fr>
  Ã  noyau
 </fr>
 <ab>
  If your
  <tl>
   molds
  </tl>
  are of
  <m>
   good plaster
  </m>
  which withstands
well the fire,
  <del>
   &amp;
  </del>
  they will not crack at all, especially
if, with
  <tl>
   presses
  </tl>
  , they are squeezed well between two
  <tl>
   boards
  </tl>
  or in a
  <tl>
   vessel filled with
   <m>
    ashes
   </m>
   or
   <m>
    sand
   </m>
  </tl>
  , &amp; in this way they will make no flashing. But if they do
make some, you can remove it with a
  <tl>
   burin
  </tl>
  that one calls
  <tl>
   <df>
    <fr>
     chaple
    </fr>
   </df>
  </tl>
  , which has a tip like a small
  <tl>
   chisel
  </tl>
  .
