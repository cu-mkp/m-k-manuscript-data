<head>Flower in the mouth of the <al>snake</al></head>

<ab>If you want to put in the mouth of the <al>snake</al> some flower
<del><fr>q</fr></del> or some branch of a plant which contains the
<md>antidote</md> against its bite, take a little branch, as best
arranged as you can find, &amp; pose its stem into its mouth. Then put
two little pieces of <m>wax</m> around the stem of the plant. And with
the <tl>end of a <m><del>iron</del> wire</m> that is hot</tl>, melt the
<m>wax</m> a little, &amp; with the other <tl><bp>hand</bp></tl>, close
the jaws of the animal. And then you can cut the head to make it burn
with the flower. If the plant <del><fr>s</fr></del> is strong enough, it
will hold up by itself, and should it be weak like <pa>wormwood</pa>
leaf, which droops, the humidity of the <m>sand</m> will lift it up, &amp; make
it swim &amp; hold up without putting anything there, although you could
pass underneath it some <tl>thread</tl>, going through with a
<tl>needle</tl>.</ab>
