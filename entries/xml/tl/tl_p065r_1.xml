 Shadows
 <ab>
  Because blacks make different colors, some a reddish black, others
tending toward blue, and others toward green, choose those which tend
toward yellow to make beautiful shadows in
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  , for the shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground
  <m>
   jet
  </m>
  , which you will mix with a little

    yellow

you have ground your

  grind the
  <m>
   jet
  </m>
  into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, &amp; making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men’s shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women’s shadows. Take, then, some
black of

  , a little
  <m>
   sap green
  </m>
  &amp;
  <m>
   bistre

you will have a perfect shadow for women in
