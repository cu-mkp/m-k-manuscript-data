<head><m>Powder</m> for hourglasses</head>

<ab>It is made very fine &amp; without being subject to rust &amp; by
its weight able to flow; taking i <ms>lb</ms> of <m>lead</m>, melt it
and skim and purify it from its <m>filth</m>, then pour into it four
<ms>â„¥</ms> of <m>finely pulverized common salt</m>, and
take good care that there be neither <m>stones</m> nor <m>earth</m>. And
immediately after you have poured it, mix continuously very well with an
<tl><m>iron</m></tl> until the <m>lead</m> and <m>salt</m> are well
incorporated, and lift it immediately from the fire, stirring
continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl> and pass it through a <tl>fine sieve</tl>. Then
wash it so many times that the <m>water</m> <del><fr>sembl</fr></del>
becomes clear, throwing away that little <m>powder</m> which will swim
on it, renewing the <m>water</m> so many times that it stays entirely
uniform.</ab>
