<head><m>Sand</m>, <m>slate</m>, and <m>burned earth</m></head>

<ab><m>Thoroughly burnt sand</m> loses its bond. <m>Slate</m> is reheated &amp; molds
neatly. Next, it is true that it often becomes porous, as <m>burned
earth</m> also does, as <m>fatty sand</m> also does.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">

I find that one ought not to knock on <m>very finely ground sands</m>, for it
shakes them loose &amp; <del>make</del> prevents them from releasing
neatly. But one ought to press hard and moisten them sufficiently.</ab>
