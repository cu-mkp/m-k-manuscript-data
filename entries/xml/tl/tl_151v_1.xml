<ab>One needs to make it between two quite <tl>sparkling hot <m>iron
plates</m></tl>, especially the lower one, which will be sloping, on
which you will put some <m><pa>wheat</pa></m>, quite even &amp; uniform.
And then you will place the other, all red, on top, &amp; you will press
it until you see the <m>black oil</m> drip well. Reiterate that until
you have enough of it. This <m>oil</m> dries immediately. It gives gold
color to <m>silvered</m> &amp; burnished things, augments the color of
<m>gilded</m> things, serves as a <m>varnish</m> on <m>iron</m> for
engraving<comment rid="c_004v_02"/> on it afterward, for varnishing <wp>sword guards</wp> tawny. And could
also serve <pro>makers of <m>gilded leather</m></pro> well.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">One needs to use it when it is newly
made. And for things to be molded, it must not be as thick as for
coloring.

<ab margin="left-middle">It is not for anointing hairy animals,
for it is too strong &amp; stiff, but it is good to give form to the
legs of a small animal, like a <al>fly</al> &amp; suchlike. It is also
excellent for coloring <m>false white stones</m>.</ab></div>
