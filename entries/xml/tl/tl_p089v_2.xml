<head><m><pro>Glassmakers'</pro> white sand from the
<env>mine</env></m>, mixed with <m>sal ammoniac</m></head>

<ab>There is found in <pl>Cominge</pl>, near the <env>town</env> of
<pl>Aurignac</pl>, a <m>sand white <del><fr>mai</fr></del> like
<m>salt</m> and lean</m>, that <pro>glassmakers</pro> &amp;
<pro>potters</pro> use, which becomes impalpable ground on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl> &amp; is easy to grind. And once ground, it
resembles <m>calcined alabaster</m>. It molds very neatly, and I have
not found any that molds as delicately as this one for low<del><fr>f</fr></del><comment rid="c_089v_03"/> relief. It is
excellent to <tl>mold</tl> <fr>en noyau</fr> without a <tl>frame</tl>, having ground it
impalpable with <m>gummed or pure water</m> on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>,
then placing it, thick as <m>mustard</m> or a little more, on the medal,
anointed lightly with <m>oil either of <pa>olive</pa>, <pa>walnut</pa>, or even
better <pa>spike lavender</pa></m>. But to do it better
<del><fr>mo</fr></del>, let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or
two <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Although, if you are in a hurry, you can
heat it well, &amp; it will not crack if it is not put on too lightly.
It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes
some holes &amp; pustules, which it does not do when dried in the cold or
at ease rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it &amp; it will
withstand several casts.</ab>
