If they are painted with colors on the <m>wax</m>, &amp; if the
<m>wax</m> is not tinted &amp; mixed with color within, the color lifts
off &amp; is undone if you mold them <fr>en noyau</fr>, but the portrait
is not spoiled. One needs to <m>oil</m> them lightly, bathing in
<m>eau-de-vie</m> &amp; tempering with <m>hot water</m>. If they are
varnished, one needs to mold them two or three times to lift off the
<m>varnish</m>, which sticks to the <tl>mold</tl>. After it is removed,
you will be able to mold nealy. If they are on <m>wood</m>, one needs to
saturate the <m>wood</m> with <m>very hot melted wax</m>, for otherwise the
<tl>mold</tl> would be attached to it. <m>Lead white</m> is much better
for mixing with <m>white wax</m> than <m>ceruse</m>, for <m>lead
white</m> is firmer &amp; whiter.</ab>
