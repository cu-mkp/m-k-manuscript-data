<head>Feet of <al>small<del><fr>s</fr></del><comment rid="c_133r_01"/> female lizards</al> for
<m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>Because the feet of these, which are very small, are very delicate,
when you have molded the top and <del><fr>d</fr></del><comment rid="c_128r_04"/> you uncover the belly
&amp; the bottom of the feet, cover them lightly with <m>wax</m> &amp;
then cast the second <tl>mold</tl>. And the <m>wax</m> being removed, it
will leave a <del><fr>g</fr></del><comment rid="c_133r_02"/> little gate for the said feet. And
should the bottom of these come off in one piece, you can repair it well. And
the scales from the top of the toes will come out well.</ab>

At the end of the nails of <al>large lizards</al>, <add>place</add>
<del>make</del> on each one a little circle of <m>wax</m>, to make the
gate thus</ab>
