<ab>That which is rusty by itself, being showered with <m>salt water</m>

dried out <add>and reddened<comment rid="c_012v_01"/> in the fire</add>, is very red ground on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl> and is of the color of <m><pl>Levant</pl>
bole</m>, &amp; approaching <m>minium</m>. But that which is showered
with <m><bp>urine</bp></m> &amp; dried out acquires a deeper tincture
&amp; approaches <m>crushed <la>Ã¦s ustum</la></m> or <m>vermillion</m>.
But the first one, finely ground, acquires a bright red color, <del>in
the</del> like <m>cinnabar</m>, in <m>eau-de-vie</m>. And the ones and
the others, prepared as said, and finely ground &amp; rendered very hot,
give off red fumes like a volatile spirit if, being thus hot
and fine, one throws on top <m>vinegar</m>, <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, or
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. <m><bp>Urine</bp></m> gives much tincture, and
<m>eau-de-vie</m> also.</ab>
