  If you take enough with the tip of an
  <tl>
   <bp>
    ear
   </bp>
   picker
  </tl>
  &amp;
you pass it through the
  <m>
   <bp>
    foam of urine
   </bp>
  </m>
  , which is readily made by
those who have a
  <md>
   <bp>
    headache
   </bp>
  </md>
  , all the
  <m>
   foam
  </m>
  will dissipate.
