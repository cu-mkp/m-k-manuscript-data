<head>Counterproofing</head>

<ab>Make some <m>soap water</m> &amp; with this, rub &amp; moisten the
intaglio piece that you want to counterproof, then lay <m>white
paper</m> on it &amp; rub very vigorously across the top with a
<tl>tooth</tl> or the <tl>bottom of a <m>glass</m></tl> &amp; you will
transfer your printed piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but
if you <m>oil</m> your <m>paper</m> with <m><pa>spike lavender</pa>
<del>&amp;</del> <add>or</add> turpentine oil</m>, it will represent
from the <del>left</del> right on the other side. Then follow
these lines with a <tl>paintbrush</tl> or a <tl>quill</tl>, then heat the
<m>paper</m> &amp; the <m>oil</m> will go away &amp; leave your
<m>paper</m> white. And if you want this not to be known, if by chance,
you borrowed the piece, moisten the <m>paper</m>, and the polishing that
the <tl>burnisher</tl> has made on the back, which shows what has been
done, will not be known. The <m>soap water</m> will turn the piece
yellow, but <m>well-gummed water</m>, which has the same effect, does
not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make <m>gummed
water</m>, then mix some <m>soap</m> in it &amp; do as is said.</ab>
