<head><m>Damasked cloth</m></head>

<ab>You can damask a <m>cloth</m> with two different colors and imitate
embroidery without adding anything to it, in this way. Once it is
<m>dyed</m> yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you.
Then you will baste some <m>string</m> or a thicker <m>cord</m> onto the
pouncing and thrust it into a <m>dye of <pa><fr>guesde</fr> woad</pa>
or <pa>pastel woad</pa></m> &amp; it will become green, except that
which is beneath<del><fr>us</fr></del><comment rid="c_015r_02"/> the <m>string</m>, which will remain yellow because the
<m>green dye</m> will not have penetrated there. And you can do thus
with other colors, and instead of <m>cord</m> or <m>string</m>, add some
pieces of <m>paltry cloth</m>, cut into moresque<comment rid="c_015r_03"/> shapes, on top of the
first color<del><fr>s</fr></del>. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.</ab>
