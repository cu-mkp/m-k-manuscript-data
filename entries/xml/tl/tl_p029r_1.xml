<head><m>Stucco</m> for molding</head>

<ab>Take <m>tragacanth gum</m> and put it to soak until, having drunk
its <m>water</m>, it is swollen &amp; rendered like <m>jelly</m>. Then
grind it quite hard on <tl><m>marble</m></tl> &amp; next take
<m><pa>rye</pa> flour</m>, which is better than <m><pa>wheat</pa></m>
because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and
sprinkle your <m>tragacanth gum</m> with it, &amp; continue to grind
<add>and mix in</add> thus, little by little, <del>it and mix
<fr>legi</fr></del> the very finely sieved <m>flour</m>. And knead it as if
you wanted to make <m>bread</m>, until <del>you</del> you perceive that
it has enough body &amp; is as firm as <m>bread dough</m> that one is
ready to put in the <tl>oven</tl>. This is recognized when it can
stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it
would not <del><fr>sti</fr></del> release well. Once the paste is prepared, rub
the hollow form <del>at the <fr>u</fr></del> with <m>oil</m>, with a
<tl>brush</tl>, in order that the <m>oil</m> penetrates everywhere to make it
release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does
not release well, mix in more <m>flour</m> until it has enough body.
With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which
will be dry within one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms>. Next, you will apply them with
<m>strong glue</m> or <m>paste glue</m>, as you like, and you will be
able to paint and decorate them with <m>gold</m> &amp; all colors. One
makes ceiling ornaments with it in <pl>Rome</pl>. One can make bed
ornaments with it. <emph>If you want that the work stays white</emph>, it
is better to mold with <m>plaster</m> instead of <m>flour</m>. It is
true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare
it like this: temper it, when it is powdered <del>strong</del>, in a
good amount of <m>water</m> so that it is <add>clear</add>, &amp; grind
it several <ms>times</ms> a <tmp>day</tmp> for fifteen <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Then pour off the
<m>water</m> by tilting, and gather the <m>plaster</m> &amp; grind it
finely on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, &amp; place it in some kind of
clean <tl><m>lead</m> vessel</tl>, so that no dust &amp; dirt falls into
it, &amp; leave it <env>in the open air</env> &amp; <env>in the <fr>serain</fr></env> 
for fifteen <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> with its <m>water</m>, and
it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making
a seat for burnished <m>gold</m>. And this, in powder form, you
can mix, instead of <m>flour</m>, with <m>tragacanth gum</m>, and your
work will be very beautiful. Lacking <m>plaster</m>, you can mix in well
ground <m>chalk</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, &amp; try <m>bole</m> &amp;
similar things. This <m>stucco</m> with the <m>tragacanth gum</m> has
the quality that, yielding when it is not yet dry, it can be accommodated on either
round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little
expense.

<m>Flour</m> is not good in this, but <m>chalk</m> or <m>ceruse</m> is.
