<ab>According to the strength of your <tl>knives, either
<env>kitchen</env> or table</tl>, you will make them support a large
weight on their tips laid down &amp; arranged in a triangle, edge to
edge, as you can see, &amp; they would not touch the ground. And if,
after arranging them this way, you turn them the other way without
unjoining them, the tips of the handles can also support a large weight
without touching the ground. You can easily adapt this to another
use with <tl>pikes, with joists</tl>, or to promptly make a tripod in a
camp with three <tl>halberd points</tl>. If the edge of the
<tl>knife</tl> marked A faces from right to left, the butts of the
handles will rise, but if the edge of the same <tl>knife</tl> faces from
left to right, the tips will rise.</ab>
