<head>Molding</head>

<ab>If you want to promptly mold something in half relief that
comes to hand, fold some <tl><m>paper</m></tl> in five or six doubles,
&amp; place it on the <tl>medal</tl> &amp; make sure the
<tl><m>paper</m></tl> is folded on the back of the <tl>medal</tl> so
that it is well secured. Next, take a <tl>stick</tl>, broad at one end
&amp; pointed at the other, well smoothed, and rub well on the
<tl><m>paper</m></tl>, &amp; with the point of the <tl>stick</tl> retrace
the lines &amp; proceed until you recognize that your imprint is well
done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub <m>oil</m> with a
<tl>paintbrush</tl> <del><fr>lemp</fr></del> on the
<tl><m>paper</m></tl> imprint and cast in <m>tallow</m> or
<m>wax</m> or <m>sulfur</m>, &amp; the <tl><m>paper</m></tl>, without
burning, will render your portrait neat, which you will afterward be able to
mold in <m>plaster</m> or <m>tripoli</m>, and then in
<m>lead</m> &amp; other <m>metal</m>.</ab>

Polished <tl><m><fr>carton</fr></m></tl> of little thickness &amp; a little
moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with
<tl><m>paper</m></tl> glued on the back.</ab></div>
