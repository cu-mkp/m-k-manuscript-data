<head><m>Silver</m> for casting</head>

<ab>It is <m>not fine silver but alloyed</m>, &amp; which does not
become perfectly white on the fire because they put it to whiten after the
fusion to also clean it of the <m>solder</m> <del>or of this</del>. When
you need to attach some <del>leg</del> animal against another or to
repair, it is commonly <m><cn>teston</cn> silver</m>. And all
<m>alloyed silver</m>, as long as it is sweet, is good.</ab>

<ab>Before starting to cast <add>in <m>silver</m></add>, one needs to
have <m>earth</m> <del>of which</del> which withstands the fire, like
the <m>sandy earth</m> <del>of <fr>qu</fr></del> mixed with <m>cloth
waste which <pro>founders</pro> use to cast their <wp>cannons</wp></m>, or any
<m><tl>good lute</tl></m> which withstands the fire, in order to surround your
<tl>molds</tl> &amp; fortify them, for they must be all red. One
needs to also bind them with <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>.</ab>

<ab>That before <del>casting <fr>l'ar</fr></del> reheating the <tl>molds</tl>, you
have the mixture one needs to make the <m>silver</m> run.</ab>

<ab>If the <pro>goldsmiths</pro> knew <corr><del>knew</del></corr> the substance to make
<m>silver</m> run in their works, they would buy much of it. Some buy it five
<cn>sous</cn> for a <ms><fr>denier</fr></ms>.</ab>

Before <del>binding</del> <m><tl>luting</tl></m> &amp; strengthening your <tl>molds</tl>
for <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> with the aforesaid <m>earth</m>, one
needs for the cast to be made &amp; the vents, &amp; the <tl>molds</tl>
to have been reheated <del>of</del> very red to burn the animals,
flowers, and plants that are inside, &amp; to clean them well of the
<m>ashes</m>. Once quite clean &amp; prepared, <m><tl>lute</tl></m> them &amp; bind them
with <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>, &amp; reheat them again until they will
be quite red.</ab>
