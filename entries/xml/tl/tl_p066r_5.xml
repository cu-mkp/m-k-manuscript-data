<ab>The <pl>Flemish</pl> give a layer of <m>distemper glue</m> 
on the molding, then mix <m>lamp black</m> or
<m>soot black</m> with the same <m>glue</m> &amp; let dry.
Next they pounce some moresque in the corners &amp; paint it
with <m>minium</m>, <m>massicot</m>, &amp; <m><fr>ocre de ru</fr></m>,
<add>and a little <m>yellow ocher</m></add>, tempered with <m>fatty oil</m>
in which they clean their <tl>paintbrushes for <m>oil</m></tl>,
because the three aforesaid colors are gripping &amp; dry immediately.
Next they lay down the <m>gold</m>, then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
<m>oil</m>, but it would not be good because the <m>gold</m> would
attach itself everywhere &amp; not only to the moresque. Go

To make <m><fr>or mat</fr></m> beautiful, put in a little <m>varnish</m>
or <m>fatty oil</m>, not from that which is made from the cleaning of
<tl>paintbrushes</tl>, but the pure, which is made fatty <env>in
the sun</env> or mixed with <m>ceruse</m>.</ab>

<m><fr>Or mat</fr></m> of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than
