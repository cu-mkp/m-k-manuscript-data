To make <m><fr>or mat</fr></m> beautiful, put in a little <m>varnish</m>
or <m>fatty oil</m>, not from that which is made from the cleaning of
<tl>paintbrushes</tl>, but the pure, which is made fatty <env>in
the sun</env> or mixed with <m>ceruse</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-top" render="tall">


<m><fr>Or mat</fr></m> of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than
<del><fr>es</fr></del><comment rid="c_066v_05"/> <m>burnished gold</m>, and lasts
longer <env>in the rain</env> &amp; besides, &amp; is made sooner.
<m>Burnished gold</m> cracks <tmp>over time</tmp> &amp; comes off
<env>in the rain</env>.</ab>
