  The

  give a layer of
  <m>
   distemper glue
  </m>
  on the molding, then mix
  <m>
   lamp black

  or
  <m>
   soot black

  with the same
  <m>
   glue

  &amp; let dry.
Next they pounce some moresque in the corners &amp; paint it
with

  <tl>
   paintbrushes for
   <m>
    oil

  </tl>
  ,
because the three aforesaid colors are gripping &amp; dry immediately.
Next they lay down the
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  , then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  , but it would not be good because the
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  would
attach itself everywhere &amp; not only to the moresque. Go
