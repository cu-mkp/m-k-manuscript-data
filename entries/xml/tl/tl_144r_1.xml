will mold their top shell in two pieces, the bottom ones in two or three
or four, according to the need. But, note that if you want to release
your <al>turtle</al> from the <tl>mold</tl> without burning it, it needs
to be molded thus in several pieces. But, if you want it to be burned
<del><fr>p</fr></del> inside, you can mold the top shell in one piece.
Therefore, to put your hand to the work after you have killed it entirely
in <m>vinegar</m> &amp; <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, as said, let it dry well. And
clean it well with your <tl>small bristle brushes</tl>. Next, <del>not</del> take your
<tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl> and put it on top and <po>smudge</po> it a little, in order
that the bottom shell fastens to it, having, nevertheless, earlier
shaped the head with a <tl>strong point</tl>, as with other animals,
making it hold high by the means of <del>one</del> a little <tl><m>fresh
clay</m></tl> that you will adapt from underneath. Stretch the said
head &amp; legs with your <tl>little pincers</tl>. The head arranged,
dexterously place <del><fr>d</fr></del> a <m>grain of <pa>yellow
millet</pa></m> in each eye with <tl>pincers</tl>, because as soon as
they are dead the eyes are burst and putrid. You can do this as well
with all other small animals, with some <m>grain of <pa>large
amaranth</pa></m>, <m><pa>some of small</pa></m>, and <m>grain of
<pa>rapeseed</pa></m>, &amp; this done, you will arrange the legs,
securing them with <tl><m>iron</m> points</tl> and then, with some
<m>clay</m>, fill up all the empty space around the <al>turtle</al>,
that is to say what is between the two shells, in order that the <m>sand</m>
entering there does not prevent it from releasing. And because the legs
should be lower than the shell of the <del><fr>s</fr></del>
