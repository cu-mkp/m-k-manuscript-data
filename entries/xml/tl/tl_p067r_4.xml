<head><m>Varnish</m> on <m>paper</m></head>

<ab>The <pl>Germans</pl> make boxes <del><fr>p</fr></del> covered with painted
<m>paper</m> &amp; varnish it with <m>glair of egg</m> mixed with
<m>gum</m> &amp; a little <m><m>oil</m>, not of <m><pa>spike
lavender</pa></m>, but <m>another <sn>fragrant</sn> one that resembles
<pa>olive</pa> oil</m></m>. Every work done with <m>glair</m>
supports <m>oil</m>. It is with this that <pro>painters</pro> trick the
<pro>poor peasants</pro>, painting their bands of <m>taffeta</m> with
this <m>glair</m>, to be done sooner. But <env>the first rain</env>
carries away everything.</ab>
