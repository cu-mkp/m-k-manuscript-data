<head><al>Small birds</al></head>

<ab><oc><al>Ortolans</al></oc> sing <tmp>at night</tmp> if they are left
<env>in the <fr>serain</fr></env>, but they are better for fattening for
fine tables than for singing. <al>Chaffinches</al> are prone to becoming
blind, &amp; their eyes become swollen at the <tmp>beginning of
August</tmp>. <al>Goldfinches</al> like <pa>lettuce</pa> seeds very
much, &amp; often one catches them in <env>gardens</env> on seeded
<pa>lettuces</pa> with two <tl>lime twigs</tl>. But because such regular
fare would be too expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with
<pa>hemp</pa> seed. The <al><fr>passe solitaire</fr></al><comment rid="c_050v_01"/> is purged
with a <m><al>spider</al></m>, which one needs to give to it
<ms><tmp>once a week</tmp></ms> in order that no
<fr>gaillardisse</fr><comment rid="c_049v_06"/> comes to it. The <al>calandra</al> is purged with <m>dry
mortar</m>, composed of <m>lime</m> &amp; <m>sand</m> to keep it from
<fr>gaillardise</fr> &amp; fattening too much. <al>Young small
birds</al> are purged with the same <m>dry mortar</m>, by putting some
pieces in their <tl>cages</tl>. The <al>cuckoo</al> lays in the nest of
<oc><al>ortolans</al></oc> otherwise called <al><fr>verdaule</fr></al>.
This <al>bird</al> is very simple. In the past, I have given leave to two of them,
which <tmp>after several days</tmp> returned to their cage. For feeding
young <al>goldfinches</al>, one needs to <tl>pestle</tl>
<m><pa>almonds</pa></m> with <del><m>pith</m></del> <add>a very little amount
of <m>bread pith</m></add> and <m>l<pa>ettuce</pa> seed</m> or
<m><pa>hemp</pa> seed</m>. If it is for <al>linnet</al>, some
<m><pa>rapeseed</pa></m>.</ab></div>
