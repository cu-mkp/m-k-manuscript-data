<head>Cast for <m>copper</m> and <m>latten</m></head>

<ab>For <m>red copper</m>, one needs to put <m>sal ammoniac</m>, which
cleans &amp; purges it of all its crust when it is well melted. There
are some who put in pieces of <del><m>old leather</m></del> thick <m>new
leather</m>. Others, <m>parings of the feet of <al>field mice</al></m>.
Others, melted <m>common salt</m> alone, or melted with <m>saltpeter</m>.
The principal is <m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; a little <m>fine tin</m>, as
to what you want to cast. <m>Red copper</m> is more troublesome to melt
<del>M</del> than <m>latten</m>. But when it is well melted, it runs
better, especially if it is alloyed <del>with a</del> with <m>latten</m>.
<m>Latten</m> alloys with a <ms>quarter</ms> of <m>copper</m>, and
one puts it<comment rid="c_116v_02"/> in like in <m>copper</m>. But
particularly,<comment rid="c_116v_01"/> a little <m>calamine</m> makes it run well.</ab>
