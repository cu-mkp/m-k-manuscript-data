<head><tl>Frames</tl><comment rid="c_061v_02"/> of the <pl>Germans</pl> </head>

<ab><pl>Germans</pl> who work in miniature make <tl>frames</tl> not of
<m>glass</m>, but of <m>canvas</m> anointed with <m>clear turpentine
varnish</m>, namely <ms>half</ms> <m>turpentine oil</m> &amp; <ms>almost
half</ms> <m>turpentine</m>, because this light, which is not as bright
as from <m>glass</m>, makes features appear larger to them. And when they want
to make something subtle like veins <del><fr>de</fr></del> &amp; similar
things, they use <tl>paintbrushes composed of two or three
<m><al>rat</al> whiskers</m></tl>.</ab>
