<ab>One needs to <tl>pestle</tl> <m>white &amp; yellow marcasites</m> &amp;
diverse kinds of <m>minerals</m>, &amp; then wash them well, in
order that the earthy &amp; powdery part is cleaned &amp; there remains
only the lustrous grain of the <m>mineral</m>, with which you will
sprinkle your <m>rock</m> previously covered with <m>strong glue</m>, 
if your <del><fr>grasse</fr></del> <env>grotto</env> is
<del><fr>r</fr></del> not for a fountain &amp; for touching
<m>water</m>, and you will have a nice work.</ab>
