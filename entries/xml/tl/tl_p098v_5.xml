  To cast carefully, one ought not to take
  <m>
   metals already
alloyed
  </m>
  , but take them pure &amp; mix them.

flame is very white &amp; the substance is in a liquid
bath like
  <m>
   water

  &amp; casting off pale blue flames,
cast. The secret is to cast
  <add>
   very

 <ab>
  <emph>
   <m>
    Lean white sand
   </m>
  </emph>
  without bond renders quite 
proper for casting, &amp;, having body, if
you grind it very finely on
  <tl>
   <m>
    porphyry
   </m>
  </tl>
  or calcine it,
reddening it several times in the fire, &amp; spread it in
  <m>
   vinegar
  </m>
  or finely grind it with
  <m>
   water
  </m>
  , as you know. It
also molds very neatly
  <fr>
   en noyau
  </fr>
  , as I have experimented. But do
not moisten it with
  <m>
   salt water
  </m>
  if you want to promptly reheat it,
for
  <m>
   salt
  </m>
  boils on the fire &amp; makes pustules, being pressed by
the fire. I believe that the
  <fr>
   noyaulx
  </fr>
  , gently reheated, would not
do this. I molded very neatly
  <fr>
   en noyau
  </fr>
  the
  <m>
   substance of
skillets
  </m>
  .
  <m>
   White sand
  </m>
  <sn>
   smells like
   <m>
    sulfur
   </m>
  </sn>
  when
reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been
cast in it, it acquires in the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  <del>
   as
  </del>
  a luster as if it were
  <m>
   leaded
  </m>
  or vitrified. I believe that
  <pro>
   glassmakers
  </pro>
  could
use it.
