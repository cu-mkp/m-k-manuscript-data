<ab>

<m>Tin</m> retracts when it is thick, thus it is best to cast it thin &amp;
to make two pieces out of one, then <m>solder</m> <add>them</add> if
need be. One uses a strong piece of <m>taffeta</m> to sieve the <m>fine
sand</m> with which one first covers the medal to the <ms>thickness of a
<cn>teston</cn></ms>.</ab>
