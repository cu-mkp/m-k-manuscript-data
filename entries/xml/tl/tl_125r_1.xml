<ab>When you <del>v</del> mold something to cast <m>wax</m> in it, you
mold in <m>plaster</m> alone, reheated after being pulverized.
For, once reheated in <m>stone</m>, the outside is cooked &amp; the
inside stays almost raw. <m>Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but the one
that, being tempered, is white</m> &amp; sets very
quickly, is good. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm &amp; hard
after having set, but its takes <tmp>longer</tmp> to do so. One needs to know the
nature of each. <del>If you</del> You will never mold very neatly if
<corr><del><fr>ne</fr></del></corr> you do not temper, very thin &amp;
liquid, your <m>plaster</m> or your <m>sand of <fr>noyau</fr></m>. Temper it
<del>immediately</del> quickly after it has been reheated.</ab>

If you mold with <m>plaster</m> <del>raw</del> alone, reheat it
nevertheless as said. One needs to <m>oil</m> well the first
<tl>mold</tl>. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready,
soak it for a long time in <m>water</m>. And if it does not want to
release, soak it in <m>hot water</m>, for <m>cold water</m> hardens it.</ab>

And <m>hot water</m> softens it further. <m>Cold water</m> does not
penetrate it like it does with the mixed one, because it is harder &amp;
the mixed one is more spongy.</ab> 
    
<ab margin="left-bottom" render="wide">With this <m>plaster</m>, thus reheated as
powder, one can cast medals that do not fear the <env>rain</env>,
especially if they are varnished. One can find these in
<pl>Germany</pl>, on the houses. But take heed that the <m>water</m> be
very hot, &amp; if it is boiling, there is no danger. All
<tl><m>plaster</m> molds</tl>, alone or mixed, release in it.</ab>
