<ab>The <pro>workers</pro> from <pl>Damascus</pl> or from
<pl>Hungary</pl>, neighbors to the <pl>Turks</pl>, separate, in the
<m>ore</m>, <m>iron</m> from <m>steel</m>. And, from this
first <m>steel</m>, first melted from its <m>ore</m>, they
cast <wp>scimitar</wp> blades in <m>sand</m> <del><fr>sab</fr></del> which afterward cut the other <m>iron</m> without any difficulty,
because any <m>melted iron</m> is harder than <m>soft iron</m>
beaten from pigs &amp; bars. Thus is the <m>steel</m> of <wp>scimitars</wp>, but
it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts <del><fr>b</fr></del> a <wp>scimitar</wp>,
one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in
<m>sand</m>.</ab>
