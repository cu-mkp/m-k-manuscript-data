<ab>Because <pa>millet</pa> is by nature very dry,
<pro>harvesters</pro> beat it most often <tmp>at night <env>in the cool
&amp; by moonlight</env></tmp>. Which could not be done with another
<m>grain</m> that is more humid, for one <del><fr>le</fr></del> must let the
sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the <tmp>sun is
approaching midday</tmp>. Quickly after the <pa>millet</pa> is
cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats it &amp; makes it lean as
much as if the <pa>millet</pa> was still standing. The ground
where the <pa>millet</pa> has been sown diminishes much
in its fertility <del>&amp; c</del>, which one knows
<del>well</del> <tmp>at the next sowing</tmp> that one makes after that. But above
all the <m>grain</m> called
    <pa><fr><oc>pomole</oc></fr></pa><comment rid="c_009r_01"/> in <pl>Gascony</pl> or
<pa><fr>baillard</fr></pa> in <pl>France</pl>,<comment rid="c_009r_02"/> makes the earth shake seven <tmp>years</tmp> later,
according to the common saying. <pa>Beans</pa>
improve &amp; correct the soil, provided that one lets the roots &amp; stems
rot in it.</ab>
