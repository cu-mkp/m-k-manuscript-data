<head><m><pa>Pastel woad</pa></m></head>

<ab>It is grown in <pl>Lauragais</pl> <env>where the depth of the earth is so
fertile</env> that if one were to grow <pa>wheat</pa> there <ms><tmp>every
year</tmp></ms>, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why
one alternately does <pa>pastel woad</pa> and <pa>wheat</pa>
there. For the cultivation of <pa>pastel woad</pa>, one ploughs
the soil with <tl>shovels of <m>iron</m></tl>, as <pro>gardeners</pro> do.
Next, one harrows it with <tl>rakes</tl>, &amp; breaks it up finely as
for sowing <pa>cooking herbs</pa>. One commonly sows it <tmp>on
<pn>St. Anthony</pn>’s day in January</tmp>.<comment rid="c_039r_01"/> One makes eight harvests
of it. The first ones are better. The best <pa>pastel woad</pa>
of <pl>Lauragais</pl> is the one from <pl>Carmail</pl> &amp; the one
from <pl>Auragne</pl>. And sometimes the <pa>pastel woad</pa>
is good <env>in one field &amp; in the one close by it</env> will hardly
have worth. The goodness of the <pa>pastel woad</pa> is known
when, put in the <bp>mouth</bp>, it gives a <sn>taste as of
<m>vinegar</m></sn>, or when crumbling &amp; breaking it, it has some
mold-like veins which are as if golden or silver. One assays it in the
<tl><pro>dyers</pro>’ vat</tl>, and to fill a <tl>vat</tl> with it, one
needs six <ms>balls</ms> of it. In this, one dyes several <ms>locks</ms> of
<m>wool</m>, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be fifteen
<cn>florins</cn>, if it gives xx dyings, xx <cn>florins</cn>. The good
kind dyes up to 30 times &amp; commonly up to xxv or 26.</ab>
