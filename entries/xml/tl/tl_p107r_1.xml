<ab>To hold the cores, some use <tl><m>wire of the same
metal</m> that they cast</tl> because it reduces <del>with</del> &amp;
melts with its counterpart, but because when melting or folding, the
core changes, some find it better to <del><fr>r</fr></del> use
<tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>, sharpened at the ends, because it holds
firmer &amp; having delicate ends, it appears as no more than a point of
a needle. And one can apply <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m> before using
it for a work. If it makes a hole, one covers it with a small
<tl>chisel</tl>.</ab>

<ab><m>Eau-de-vie</m> prevents the <m>sand</m> from becoming porous &amp; does
not make little holes on the edges of the <tl>mold</tl> if the thing to
mold is well moistened with it. The holes &amp; blisters &amp; bubbles
are not made on the side of the <tl>mold</tl>, which is thick, but at
the edges, which are thinner.</ab>

<ab>One casts with <m>common silver</m>, with which <pro>goldsmiths</pro>
commonly work, which alloys <del>And <fr>qua</fr></del> indifferently.
And when one were to cast with <m>solder</m>, it would run even
better.</ab>
