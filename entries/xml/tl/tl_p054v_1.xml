  To dry preserves
  <del>
   take a
  </del>
  which are not liquid, take an
open
  <tl>
   tub
  </tl>
  pierced on both sides with a small, square window,
&amp; pass
  <tl>
   sticks
  </tl>
  through these on one side and the other,
&amp; place on these a
  <tl>
   sieve made of strings
  </tl>
  in the form of a
net. And on this, you will properly arrange the
  <tl>
   vessels
  </tl>
  with your
preserves. And having put at the bottom of the
  <tl>
   tub
  </tl>
  a
  <tl>
   chafing-dish
  </tl>
  or two, cover the
  <tl>
   tub
  </tl>
  with a
  <tl>
   bedsheet
  </tl>
  folded double.
