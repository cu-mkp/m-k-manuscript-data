<head>Molding a <al>fly</al></head>

<ab><al>Large flies</al> can be molded &amp; <del><fr>g</fr></del> made
by casting. But one needs <del><fr>par d</fr></del> to anoint underneath
their wings with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, which dries quickly and
fortifies them &amp; gives them a little thickness. The same is done to
<al>butterflies</al>, <al>cicadas</al>, <al>grasshoppers</al> &amp;
similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some
leaf or bouquet. The others are <bp>made by hand</bp> with a <m>very
thin silver sheet</m>. <add>One ought not to keep them once dead,
because they dry out and their legs break.<comment rid="c_149v_01"/></add></ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

<m><pa>Wheat</pa> oil</m> is put underneath delicate things to render
them more rigid &amp; firm &amp; to make them hold their natural
position. Because being weak &amp; delicate, the <m>tempered sand</m>, weighing down
their tops, would change their form.</ab></div>
