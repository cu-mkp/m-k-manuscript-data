  <pro>
   Stone cutters
  </pro>
  sometimes choose old pieces of
  <m>
   antique
glass
  </m>
  in
  <env>
   church
  </env>
  windows, which are much thicker than
those of
  <tmp>
   today
  </tmp>
  &amp; are of more lively colors. If it is for
  <del>
   <fr>
    souf
   </fr>
  </del>
  <m>
   sapphire
  </m>
  , they choose beautiful blue
&amp; from such a place that there are no
  <del>
   pieces
  </del>
  <add>
   grains
  </add>
  , if it is possible. And having cut it in squares with
  <tl>
   <m>
    emery
   </m>
  </tl>
  , they cut it in bevel &amp; polish it. And in this manner,
they counterfeit very beautiful
  <m>
   sapphires
  </m>
  . The old
  <m>
   <fr>
    esmail dâ€™azur
   </fr>
  </m>
  for
  <m>
   silver
  </m>
  verging on aquamarine was very
appropriate for counterfeiting
  <m>
   sapphires
  </m>
  , but it is scarcely
found. One counterfeits
  <m>
   aquamarines
  </m>
  with
  <m>
   white glass
  </m>
  , but
they take it from the bottom of the
  <m>
   glass
  </m>
  .
