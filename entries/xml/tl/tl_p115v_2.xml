 For giving venting to the
 <tl>
  mold
 </tl>
 <ab>
  In addition to your vents, if your
  <del>
   <fr>
    es
   </fr>
  </del>
  plant is
very fine, you can pass a
  <tl>
   thread
  </tl>
  through the
  <add>
   <m>
    clay
   </m>
  </add>
  circle, rather than casting with a
  <tl>
   needle
  </tl>
  , &amp; make sure it passes through the plant. And with the
  <tl>
   thread
  </tl>
  burning like the plant, a hole will remain which will
give air &amp; venting, to help clean.
