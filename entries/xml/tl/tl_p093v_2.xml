  always wants to be cleaned, because the
  <m>
   filth
  </m>
  that can be perceived in the
  <m>
   wash water
  </m>
  makes it die. One needs
to layer it two times, &amp; the first very thick, moving the
  <tl>
   paintbrush
  </tl>
  by layering it first lengthwise then across.

  It is better used on
  <m>
   canvas
  </m>
  , where it is imbibed

   Varnish
  </m>
  returns it to its
vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To assay it,
  <pro>
   painters
  </pro>
  bring their
  <tl>
   palette
  </tl>

  <pro>
   grocers
  </pro>
  , &amp; temper &amp; alloy it with a little white
ground in
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  , for in this way, the beautiful shows its
  <fr>
   turquine
  </fr>
  vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
delicate is the best for working. It is thinned
  <del>
   working
  </del>
  by
washing it.
