<head>Reducing a round figure to a hollow form</head>

<ab>You need to first mold it with some <m>plaster</m>, as said
before, &amp; in the <m>plaster</m> cast in <m>wax</m>, from which will
come out a relief that you will repair very neatly, and
<del><fr>b</fr></del><comment rid="c_169v_01"/> model it as you fancy. And then you will model
this relief of <m>wax</m> again in <m>plaster</m>, or better yet, with
your <m>wetted sand <mark>#</mark><comment rid="c_112r_02"/> like for <fr>noyau</fr></m>, &amp; in the
latter, cast in some <m>lead</m>, &amp; from this you will have a very
neat relief, &amp; if it is not, repair <add>on the <m>cement</m> or
otherwise</add>, &amp; take heed that it is always of good release. And
this one will always serve you well for making as many hollow forms as you
please, in this way. Place <add>half of</add> your figure of
<m>lead</m>, <m>oiled</m> &amp; wetted with <m>eau-de-vie</m> according
to the above, in the <tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl>, then mold this half with
some <m>white plaster</m>. Having set <del>Next</del> <add>and having
well smoothed &amp; flattened the <m>plaster</m></add>, take your
<m>black wax mixed with sulfur</m>, as is said, because it leaves
nothing in the <tl>mold</tl> &amp; melts quicker. Wet it in <m><bp>warm
urine</bp></m>, &amp; once softened enough, make an imprint with it
on the half of the <m>lead</m> figure, and <del>it</del> you will have a
very neat hollow form. Shape next the hollow <m>wax</m> form in a square shape, as
you please, with sufficient thickness &amp; smooth it well on all sides,
&amp; <del>thus</del> next, mold this hollowed <m>wax</m>,
imprinted on one part &amp; flat &amp; smooth on the other, in the same
fashion that you mold flat medals of <m>wax</m> or <del>other</del>
<m>metal</m> <fr>en noyau</fr>. And the <tl>mold</tl> <fr>en noyau</fr>
will render in <m>silver</m> or such <m>metal</m> as pleases you
<del>the <fr>m</fr></del> a similar figure to the <m>wax</m>, that is to
say flat &amp; smooth on one side &amp; hollow on the other. And having
cleaned &amp; put this hollow form to be whitened, if it is <m>silver</m>,
you will be able to mix there some works of <m>sugar</m>,</ab>

<m>Transparent wax</m> is not good, but rather the one which has body,
to make an imprint well.</ab>

can mold the other the same.</ab>

necessary that the <m><add>black</add> wax</m> with which you mold be
hard, in order that, quickly &amp; <del><fr>du</fr></del> more dryly,
it retracts, in order to see if it is well imprinted. It is rendered
harder by adding into the already melted one more <m>melted sulfur</m>
