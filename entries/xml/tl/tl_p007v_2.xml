<ab>Take a <ms>dozen</ms> <m>dried common <pa>walnuts</pa></m> &amp;
throw them one after another into a good <tl>brazier</tl> where they may
catch fire, &amp; take them out with <tl>small pincers</tl>, and let them burn
&amp; flame well in the air, and extinguish them in a <tl><m>glass</m>
of <m>good wine</m></tl>. Next, let the <m>wine</m> cool and strain it,
&amp; pour <ms>half</ms> of it, for six extinguished
<m><pa>walnuts</pa></m> are for one <ms>dose</ms>. Excellent cure
