Thin <m>glass</m> for this effect is very beautiful.</add></ab>

<ab>Take <m>horn</m> from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, &amp;
underneath make the figure of your <m>jasper</m>, <m>cornalines</m>,
&amp; other <m>stones</m>, which will be a work more appropriate than on
<m>glass</m>, which is too shiny. And the <m>horn</m> presents a luster
&amp; fatty polish like <m>jasper</m>.</ab>

<ab>You know how, with scrapings of the said <m>horn</m>, 
<m><pa>roses</pa></m> can be imitated. The <del>horn</del> colors for
this <m>jasper</m> want to have a base with <m>clear turpentine</m> or
<m><pa>spike lavender</pa> varnish</m>. <add>And colors matte in body
are not so appropriate here, although they are very beautiful.</add> <add>One
needs to <m>oil</m> the unpainted reverse with <m><pa>spike
lavender</pa> oil</m>.</add></ab>

You can encrust beds with it &amp; on the joints you can throw the
<m>filings of talc or of pins</m> on the fresh <m>cement</m> of the said
joints. One needs to join them with <m>gum ammoniac</m> soaked in
<m>vinegar</m>. To better counterfeit <m>mottled jasper</m>, apply
<m>wool with thick hairs</m> dyed in diverse colors &amp; intermingled.
After you have layered all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them,
then layer <m>gold &amp; silver leaf</m>. If you layer on the
<m>horn</m> colors of <m>turpentine</m>, give it a base of <m>silver</m>
or of <m>tin leaf</m>. You can also <tl>file</tl> <m>horn</m> &amp; mix
it with <m>strong glue</m>, &amp; layer it onto the joints of the
piece of <m>horn</m>, then even it with a <tl>joiner's plane</tl>.</ab>
