<ab>Then one mounts them on a medium thick board close to 
one<del><fr>g</fr></del><comment rid="c_022v_08"/> another &amp; one makes
    notches on the board this way <figure size="small" id="fig_p022v_2" link="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5RnQ2Ri1PenA1aDA">
</figure> &amp; through these notches one passes the hook of the <wp>arquebus</wp> which
has a hole through which one passes <tl><m>iron</m> pegs</tl> from under
the board. Then, when one wants to aim it, one mounts the middle one
&amp; that on both sides. If you want to make a double row, or triple or
quadruple or more, you need only place a similar row of boards like the
first, one on the other. <del>For the other</del> This kind of <wp>orgues</wp>
penetrates &amp; <add>is</add> quite stable. For the other ones which
are made of one piece like a solid square have <wp>cannons</wp> only
<del>three</del> <del>four</del> one <ms><fr>pan</fr></ms> &amp; a half
long. Also, they only serve for making a salvo at an entry or for
defending a door.</ab>

A small <wp>arquebus Ã  croc</wp> weighs 40 <ms>lb</ms>, is four
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long, is loaded <ms>up to the
escutcheon</ms>,<comment rid="c_018v_02"/> has <ms>three balls at the breech &amp; two
in front</ms>.</ab>

<ab>

The <df><wp>double cannon</wp></df> is no different from the <wp>large ordinary cannon</wp>, except
that it carries <del><ill/></del> its ball <del><ill/></del> which has
one <ms>line</ms><comment rid="c_022v_02"/> of thickness, or of
diameter, more. The <df><ms>line</ms></df> is a <ms>twelfth part of the
ball of the <wp>cannon</wp></ms>. At the breech, it has one <ms>line</ms> of
thickess more than the <wp>cannon</wp>, &amp; half at the front. Its charge is
six or seven <ms>lb</ms> of <m>powder</m>, more than a <wp>cannon</wp>, namely by
two big <ms><tl>ladles</tl></ms>. Its ball weighs 56 <ms>lb</ms>. One
needs thirty <al>horses</al> to draw it. It makes much
more of a fracas at the wall than the <wp>cannon</wp>. But it is very troublesome
to draw. It is for this reason that one hardly uses it today, and it is
more for moving to some nearby place &amp; battering at close range or
for an entry, than for ordinary business. One calls<comment rid="c_022v_06"/> them
<df><wp><fr>basilics</fr></wp></df>, and they are <wp>pieces</wp> made for pleasure.</ab>
