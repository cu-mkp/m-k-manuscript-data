<head>Neat work</head>

<ab>When you are working, make sure not to stir up dust, &amp; when you
leave your work, cover it in order that the said dust will not fall upon it.
Also layer your colors as thinly as you can, for if they are thick you
will be not be able to soften them thoroughly.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">





Also do not layer color on color if they are not similar, such as white
on black, but rather flesh color on flesh color, &amp; thus with the
others. And leave blank the space for shadow or a different color.
<del><fr>Ains</fr></del> In this way, layering each manner of color
on the imprimatura itself, they will not die &amp; you will work
neatly.</ab></div>
