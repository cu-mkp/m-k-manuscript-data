<head>For <m>gilding</m> on <m>wood</m></head>

<ab>First one needs to put down a layer of <m>very clear glue</m>, and
once dry, you will put down a layer of <m>yellow gold</m>. And when it is
done, you will take <m><pa>fig tree</pa> wood</m>, &amp; put it to soak
some space of time, &amp; wash the places you want to <m>gild</m>, and
cut your <m>gold</m> with a <tl>knife</tl> to the price that you will
lay. And one must lay the said <m>gold</m> with 
<tl><m>cotton</m></tl> <del><fr>ie</fr></del>.<comment rid="c_075v_04"/> 
And if you can find a <pa>fig tree</pa>,
take the <m>the white of one egg</m> &amp; stir it vigorously.</ab>

<ab>

If your <m>gold</m> does not have beautiful enough color, you will take
a <m><al>partridge</al> feather</m>, &amp; make it burn in a<tl>
chafing-dish</tl>, and make the <m>smoke</m> go against what you have
<m>gilded</m>.</ab>
