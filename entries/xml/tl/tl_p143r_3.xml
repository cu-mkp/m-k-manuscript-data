  Once molded, it can be removed without burning it, because it
releases well. Choose the biggest &amp; the lumpiest. Because they

come out better. You could make your cast in one piece &amp; large, but

  would be awkward to cut. It is best to do it in
three or 4 parts, which are a little wide close to the animal, &amp;
include as much of the edge of this, which is close to the gate, as
can be done. Make also some gate conduits from the end of
