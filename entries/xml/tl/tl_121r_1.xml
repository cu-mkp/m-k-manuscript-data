<head>For keeping fruits all <tmp>year</tmp></head>

<ab>One needs to pick them in <env><fr>serain</fr> &amp;
<del><fr>s</fr></del> quite dry weather</env> &amp; by the stem without
<sn>touching</sn> <del>it</del> the fruit with your <bp>hand</bp>, and
put them in <tl><m>glass</m> bottles</tl> that have a wide
opening, like tall <tl><m>glass</m> boxes</tl> for putting preserves.
Fortify them with <m>straw</m> or something else so that they may not
break, and seal them well with <m>wax</m> so that they may not breathe.
And if they had a <m>glass</m> lid, well-sealed with <m>wax</m>, they
would be all the better. Put them in a <tl>case</tl> in your
<env>well</env>, or in your <env>cellar</env> in a <tl><po>vat</po>, or in a
<fr>cos</fr><comment rid="c_121r_01"/> of earth full of <m>water</m></tl>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

For where the <bp>hand</bp> will <sn>touch</sn>, it will rot,
and it is even good not to <bp>breathe</bp> on them. You can also put in
<m>leaves from <pa>vine</pa></m>.</ab>
