<ab>When <pro>goldsmiths who work large wares</pro> have
forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that
it bursts &amp; cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,
when it is well melted, some <m>dry mortar</m> composed of <m>sand</m> &amp;
<m>good lime</m> which has been worked, &amp; pulverize it &amp; throw
it in.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> do not work at all with
the <m>silver from <cn>reals</cn></m> that is not alloyed, because it is
<m>leady</m> &amp; when forging it sours.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">

Some solder, for small works &amp; things which only go in the fire
once, with some <cn>old sou</cn> &amp; <cn>carolus</cn>, reheated &amp; beaten. 
However, if the <cn>sou</cn> is not very
good, the <m>solder</m> eats away &amp; one needs to solder there twice,
&amp; one finds there too much <m>copper</m>. Others solder with
<ms>half</ms> <m>silver</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms> <m>fine copper</m>.</ab>
