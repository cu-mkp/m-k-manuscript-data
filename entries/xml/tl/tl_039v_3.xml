<head>Tracing some history on <m>glass</m></head>

<ab>If you want to trace some history in intaglio on <m>glass</m>, you
can do it in different ways. Lay your <m>glass pane</m> <del>on</del>,
the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, &amp; having cleaned
the <m>glass</m> well with <m>lye</m> &amp; <m>ash</m> so that it is not
greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with <m><fr>noir à
huile</fr></m> or <m><fr>noir d’escaille</fr></m> with the
<tl>paintbrush</tl>; if you want to paint with colors in the
fashion of <pro>glassworkers</pro>, who wash their <m>glass pane</m> with
<m><fr>noir d’escaille</fr></m> &amp; then scrape &amp; clear the parts
which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for
shading. But if you want to make <m>gilt</m> histories on <m>glass</m>
with a background of colors, which imitates the basse-taille of
<pro>goldsmiths</pro>, <m>gild</m> your entire <m>glass pane</m> with
<m>gum water</m> or <m><pa>garlic</pa> juice</m> or <m>milk of the <pa>fig tree</pa></m>.
Then moisten your printed history between two wet
<tl><m><pa>linen</pa> cloths</m></tl>, and lay it down on the <m>gilt
glass</m>. Then with a <tl>pin</tl> mounted on the end of a small
<tl>stick</tl>, follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to
pounce it, &amp; thus you will exactly trace it on the <m>gilding of
the glass</m>. &amp; next you will clear the background &amp; that
which needs to be blank with a quite pointy <tl><m>steel</m> awl</tl>,
&amp; neatly follow once more the lines &amp; accomplish your work
&amp; make your faces &amp; flesh colors in <m><fr>argent moulu</fr></m>;
then you shall fill the background with <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m> or
<m>verdigris</m> or <m>fine <fr>laque platte</fr></m><comment rid="c_039v_02"/> 
<del><fr>platte</fr></del> tempered with <m>clear
turpentine</m>, mixed with a little of <m>tear of mastic</m> if you want
that the colors are more even &amp; do not spread. Next, layer on
the back of the <m>glass</m> &amp; over the colors a <m>white tin
leaf</m>. And once this is dry, you can cover the <m>tin leaf</m>
<del>of</del> with color to hide your secret. The <m>tin leaf</m> gives
light to the colors. Thus you will be able to paint without being</ab>

<ab>at all expert in painting. If your <m>glass</m> pane is bulging as
if taken from the belly of some jar, it will show all the better for it.<comment rid="c_032v_01"/> When you apply
your <m>turpentine</m> colors to your <m>glass</m> panes, first place
them on a hot tile &amp;, once they are hot, spread your colors &amp;
leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your <m>tin</m> sheet.</ab>
