<head>For making the <m>ashes</m> of flowers and plants leave
<tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>Some <del><fr>meslen</fr></del> put <m>quicksilver</m> inside it. But, if it is
a small work or fine &amp; delicate foliage that only has
<del><fr>p</fr></del> a slender exit, they make two errors: the first, that
<m>quicksilver</m> by its heaviness can break <del><fr>f</fr></del> some delicate
feature inside when shaken, the other, that some grains will always
linger inside that will make <m>metals</m> sour &amp; hinder the
perfection of the cast. It is true that if it is to empty the
<tl>mold</tl> of some animal which is thickish &amp; which has big conduits
&amp; passages by which the <m>quicksilver</m> can easily exit, like a
<al>bird</al> or a <al>snake</al>, one can indeed put in it some
<m>quicksilver</m> <del><fr>pou</fr></del> to break by shaking the
<m>calcined bones of the animal</m>, because the said <m>&#9791;</m> will
come out &amp; not remain.</ab>

The <pa>asparagus</pa> stalk is so hard that most often it remains as
<m>charcoal</m>. Because of this, dry it out beforehand, or wet it with
<m>oil of sulfur &amp; turpentine</m>, or cast separately the little
branches &amp; <m>solder</m> them onto a thick stalk drawn through the
<tl>wire drawing plate</tl>.</ab>

If the burnt thing has left some <m>filth</m> or <m>ash</m>, let it cool
a little, &amp; with an <tl><m>iron wire</m> wrapped in
<m>cotton</m></tl> that can bend according to the cavities that you have
to search out, clean &amp; blow out this defect, or with a <tl>soft
brush</tl> or a <tl>cut paintbrush</tl>.</ab>
