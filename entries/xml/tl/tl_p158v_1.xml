colors have no hold. For <pa>marigold flowers</pa>, <m>lightly ground

<m>massicot</m> with it. For green, the <m>verdigris</m> has depth &amp;
is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the
<m>verdigris</m> a little <m>yellow ocher</m> &amp; <m>stil de grain

tree</pa> pits</m>, which makes a <del><fr>v</fr></del> greenish black, in the
same way that black of <m><al>ox</al> foot bone</m> looks bluish. And
thus, by judgment &amp; discretion, put the color on the <m>natural
flower or leaf</m> to see whether it comes close. <comment rid="c_158v_01"/>But layer it
