<ab>Because it is very tedious to paint in <m>distemper</m> on
<m>wood</m>, and because one is at pains to make a good

passed through a <tl>sponge</tl>, or mixed with the <m>yolk</m>,
<m>water</m>, &amp; thoroughly beaten with the <m>peelings of the <pa>fig
tree</pa></m>. With this <lb/>

as with <m>oil</m>, and this supports the <m>varnish</m>, but this does
not last.</ab>
