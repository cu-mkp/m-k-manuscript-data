<head>For molding <m>sulfur</m></head>

<ab><m>Sulfur</m> is made beautiful mixed with <m>soot black</m> or with
<m>pulverized sanguine</m>, which renders it harder and stronger. Having
let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like <m>oil</m>, mix it with
<m>verdigris</m>, and you <del><fr>m</fr></del> will very neatly cast in
<m>plaster</m> a <al>lizard</al> or something else.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



One ought not to cast unless it is well cooled &amp; unless it
has lost all its pustules &amp; bubbles, and has settled down
well &amp; become smooth like <del><ill/></del> <m>water</m>. The
<m>soot black</m> gives it a fine sheen &amp; makes it neater. The most
beautiful yellow <m>sulfur</m> must be used, for the greyish &amp;
lively one is not good. Do not cast <env>in wind</env> &amp;
<env>in cold</env>, for it would become porous.<hr/></ab>
