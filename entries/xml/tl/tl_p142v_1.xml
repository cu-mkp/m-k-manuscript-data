<head>Molding <al>grasshoppers</al> and things too thin</head>

<ab>If you have a <m>written paper</m> to mold that is too thin, after
you have made the first cast &amp; it has set, give a little thickness
to the reverse of your <m>paper</m> with <m>melted butter</m>, which is
the most appropriate means there is, &amp; for fortifying the wings of
either a <al>butterfly</al> or a <al>grasshopper</al>, or some delicate
part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to
apply this <m>melted butter</m> underneath the wing or in whichever
place it cannot be seen. For giving thickness to a <pa>pansy</pa> or
other flowers, <m>butter</m> is not good, but rather <m><pa>wheat</pa>
oil</m>, which is soon dry &amp; holds firm. <m>Wax</m> would not be
appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, &amp; it makes the thing
to which it is applied contract. But <m>butter</m> is amiable and
handleable.<hr/></ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">If you write on <m>paper</m> or on
<m>common <fr>carton</fr></m> &amp; if your
<m>letter</m> is of <m>gum</m>, the humidity of the <tl><m>clay</m>
slab</tl> or the <m>wetted sand for <fr>noyau</fr></m> will moisten your
<m>letter</m> &amp; undo it. Therefore write with
<m>cinnabar</m> wetted with <m>oil</m> on <m>oiled paper</m>
&amp; press in.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle"><comment rid="c_142v_02"/><mark>+</mark><lb/> Reheat your
<tl>molds</tl> with <m>charcoals</m> previously lit in the <tl>forge</tl>,
in order that the fire is not so hot &amp; does not break the
<tl>molds</tl>. And do not make as much fire where the <tl>mold</tl> is
thin as in the place where it is thick.<hr/></ab>
