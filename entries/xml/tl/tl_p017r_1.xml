  The
  <wp>
   cannon
  </wp>
  fires at point-blank from five to six hundred
  <ms>
   paces
  </ms>
  .
But not for battering, in which it can only perform well from two
hundred
  <ms>
   paces
  </ms>
  , or three hundred
  <del>
   <ms>
    paces
   </ms>
  </del>
  at
the most, and it should not be any farther. Its ball commonly weighs 40
  <ms>
   lb
  </ms>
  of the
  <ms>
   <pro>
    King
   </pro>
   ’s caliber
  </ms>
  . There is
a
  <df>
   <wp>
    cannon-perrier
   </wp>
  </df>
  , which weighs xxv
  <ms>
   quintals
  </ms>
  , which are
  <wp>
   small, short cannons
  </wp>
  . It is for fighting the
  <env>
   ditch casemates
  </env>
  &amp; for battering at close range. It bears a large ball of the
  <ms>
   <pro>
    King
   </pro>
   ’s caliber
  </ms>
  like the others, namely of
40
  <ms>
   lb
  </ms>
  . It bears in the breech only the
  <ms>
   width of two balls
&amp; a quarter of a ball
  </ms>
  . The front only bears the
  <ms>
   width of
one ball &amp; a third of a ball
  </ms>
  . Its charge is similar to those of
bigger ones, namely xx
  <ms>
   lb
  </ms>
  . And for this reason, when one wants to try them
  <del>
   <ill>
   </ill>
  </del>
  , one ought not to over-charge it, for this damages the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  . And for the first time &amp; until it has fired five or six
  <del>
   pieces
  </del>
  shots, it is better not to give its complete charge,
for the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  is still proving itself. And the test that one can do is
to give it a charge of xx
  <ms>
   lb
  </ms>
  of
  <m>
   fine
   <wp>
    arquebus

   powder

  &amp; puts

   the

  in danger of bursting is
the length of the
