<head>Cross of the <pro>commanders of <pl>Malta</pl></pro></head>

<ab>This beautiful <m>rouge clair</m> which makes the field of
the white <m>enamel</m> cross is <del>blood</del> of fine tear of
<m><al>dragon</al>&#8217;s blood</m> tempered with <m>eau-de-vie</m>
or else <m><pl>Indian</pl> <fr>laque platte</fr></m>, which in my opinion is made
in <pl>Flanders</pl>, tempered with <m>clear turpentine</m> &amp; tear
of <m>mastic</m> &amp; laid down on a <m>silver</m> leaf, not the kind
which the <pro>painters</pro> use, but a thicker kind, which is
burnished by <pro>those who make <m>gemstone foils</m></pro>
<del><fr>Av</fr></del> or by <pro>goldsmiths</pro>, &amp; that gives it
this beautiful brilliance.</ab></div></entry>
