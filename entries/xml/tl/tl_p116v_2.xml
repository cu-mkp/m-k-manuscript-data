<head>Mixture of <m>tin</m> and <m>lead</m></head>

<ab>For delicate plants &amp; other flowers or thin foliage, the <m>fine
tin</m> ought to exceed the <m>lead</m> more than three <ms>parts</ms>.
And if it is a thick &amp; coarse material, the <m>lead</m> ought to
exceed by more than three <ms>parts</ms>. Heat the mostly <m>tin</m>
mixture until it is almost red &amp; very hot. And when you want to
cast, in removing your <tl>crucible</tl> from the fire, throw in two or
three <ms>grains</ms> of <m>rosin</m>, &amp; for one <ms>lb &amp; a half
or two</ms> of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, put with the <m>rosin</m> as
much <m>looking-glass tin</m> <ms>as the size of a <oc><pa>hazelnut</pa></oc>
with its shell</ms>, &amp; mix &amp; cast. And make sure that there is
more of the <m>metal</m> than is needed, in order that some is left.
However, if there is not enough, finish casting, &amp; it will take. But
it will not be so neat. Next, dip your <tl>mold</tl> into <m>water</m>,
&amp; with a <tl>point</tl>, release it carefully so that nothing is
spoiled. Make your <tl>cast</tl> a bit longer. If the material is very
thin, one needs for it to be almost all <m>tin</m>.

If you <del>mold <fr>de plu</fr></del> want to cast <del>in</del> <m>lead</m> or
<m>tin</m> <fr>en noyau</fr> in the aforesaid <m>sand</m>, reheat your
<tl>mold</tl> once, only if there is nothing to burn inside. But if it
is for plants, flowers, &amp; animals to be burnt, one needs to reheat it
two times, however not as much the second time for <m>lead</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m> as for <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>gold</m>. For for these, they
ought to be red when you cast, but for <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>, let
it <ms>cool until you can hold the <tl>tip of your
<bp>finger</bp></tl> in the gate <sn>without burning yourself</sn></ms>,
but you find a lukewarm heat. </ab>
