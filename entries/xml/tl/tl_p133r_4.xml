<ab>When you have made the first reheating &amp; removed the
<tl>clamps</tl>, and you have <del>the</del> opened your <tl>mold</tl>
to clean it by blowing with <m>quicksilver</m>, which is used only in
enclosed <tl>molds</tl>, close the <tl>mold</tl> again &amp; put the
<tl>clamps</tl> on again, but not in the first place where they were.
<m><tl>Lute</tl></m> again &amp; dry again. But if it is for a cast with
<m>silver</m> or <m>gold</m>, <m><tl>lute</tl></m> with the remainder of the <m>sand</m>
that was used, for it is the safest. If your <tl>mold</tl>, while
reheating, is broken, you can adjust it with some <tl>clamps</tl> &amp;
<m><tl>lute</tl></m>.</ab>
