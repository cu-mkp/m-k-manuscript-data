 For gilding with
 <m>
  gold color
 </m>
 and

  tinsel
 </m>
 <ab>
  Once you have
  <del>
   gilded
  </del>
  <add>
   colored
  </add>
  , make your
stamping either in
  <m>
   tin
  </m>
  , as is said,

  or
in
  <m>
   iron
  </m>
  <del>
   <fr>
    dest
   </fr>
  </del>
  or
  <m>
   copper
  </m>
  . You ought not
to put a layer of
  <m>
   glue
  </m>
  there as on
  <m>
   wood
  </m>
  , but take only
  <m>
   fatty oil
  </m>
  , which is made in seven or eight
  <ms>
   days
  </ms>
  <env>
   in
the sun
  </env>
  with
  <m>
   walnut oil
  </m>
  and
  <m>
   lead white
  </m>
  <del>
   &amp;
with
  </del>
  , stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in
haste. Then, with the
  <m>
   oil
  </m>
  thus made fatty, grind a little
  <m>
   lead
white
  </m>
  ,

   massicot

  , at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
  <m>
   Minium
  </m>
  gives color to the
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  . Next, with this, you make
a layer of it evenly on your stamping, taking care not to fill the hollows.
And once it is almost dry, lay the
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  leaf on it with
  <m>
   cotton
  </m>
  . Such
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  will hold up
  <env>
   in the rain
  </env>
  on
houses &amp; elsewhere. And if you have gilded with
  <m>
   tinsel
  </m>
  , color
it with
  <m>
   smoke of
   <al>
    partridge
   </al>

   or of yellow or red
   <m>
    cloth
   </m>
  </m>
  , &amp; it will be beautiful like fine
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  . You can
cover trunks, mirrors, valences &amp; bedposts with colored
  <m>
   velvet
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   satin
  </m>
  , then apply the gilded stampings
on top with
  <m>
   strong glue
