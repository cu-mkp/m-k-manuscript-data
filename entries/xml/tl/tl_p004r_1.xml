<head><m>Varnish of spike lavender oil</m></head>

<ab>One needs to heat <m>lavender spike oil</m> &amp; as it begins to
simmer, put in <m>powdered sandarac gum</m> so that it soon melts. And
over a <m>charcoal</m> fire stir continuously until the <m>sandarac</m>
is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
<m>varnish</m> on a <tl>plate</tl>, and if it is fatty when you handle
it with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, it is ready. And for one <ms>lb</ms>
of <m>lavender spike oil</m>, you will put five <ms>ounces</ms> of
<m>pulverized sandarac</m>, although some only put in four
<ms>ounces</ms>, but this is neither so good nor so fatty. This one is
promptly dry. <pro>Frame makers</pro>, to avoid the trouble of polishing
their <m>ebony</m>, varnish it with this, as do <pro><mu>guitar</mu> makers</pro>.
This is not as appropriate for panels as that of <m>fine turpentine</m>,
though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not use to
varnish the landscape of a panel when <m>linseed varnish</m> was in use,
because it yellowed the landscape. But with that of
<m>turpentine</m>, one varnishes everywhere. You can put in
<m>pulverized mastic</m> extracted in tears or otherwise, &amp; it will be
more dessicative, in place of <m>sandarac</m>.</ab>

<ab>If you want to varnish on <m>plaster</m> or a wall, first put on
your very hot <m>hide glue</m>, because if were cold it
would not penetrate the wall, &amp; when you would put your
<m>varnish</m> on, it would come off.</ab>

<m>Varnish of spike lavender oil</m> is not as appropriate for colors as
that of <m>turpentine</m>, for <m>spike lavender oil</m> <del>makes them
die</del> <add>eats</add> the colors since it is too
penetrating.</ab>
