 Casting
 <ab>
  The
  <pl>
   Germans
  </pl>
  use
  <m>
   lead from
   <pl>
    Flanders
   </pl>
  </m>
  because
it is very soft. And to cast better they take
  <m>
   lead ore
  </m>
  &amp; melt
it, &amp; separate what is melted from the
  <m>
   filth
  </m>
  &amp;
  <m>
   ore
  </m>
  , &amp; pour it into a separate
  <tl>
   vessel
  </tl>
  , then
  <del>
   the
bottom
  </del>
  they make their cast with it. For the
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  must not have been
put to work before, but rather completely new. Some cast into
  <tl>
   molds
of
   <m>
    iron
   </m>
   &amp;
   <m>
    copper
   </m>
  </tl>
  .
 </ab>
 <ab margin="left-middle">
  or new
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  coming from the
  <env>
   mine
  </env>
  . They melt it twice
in a
  <tl>
   crucible
  </tl>
  . In the first one, they purge it of
  <m>
   filth
  </m>
  . In the second, they
  <del>
   <fr>
    en
   </fr>
  </del>
  make the cast.
