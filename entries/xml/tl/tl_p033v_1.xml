<head>For making it seem <del>that</del> to someone that he has a <tl>piece
of <m>silver</m></tl> on his <bp>forehead</bp></head>

<ab>Take a <tl>token</tl> or <tl>piece of <m>silver</m></tl> and wet it
and make it hold against your <bp>forehead</bp>. Then say to the
<pro>bystander</pro> that if you put it thus on his <bp>forehead</bp>,
he will not be able to make it fall without lifting his <bp>hands</bp>
to it, no matter how he shakes his <bp>head</bp>. And making it seem as
if you are placing it on his <bp>forehead</bp>, retain it in your
<bp>hand</bp> &amp; wet your <bp>thumb</bp> with your
<m><bp>saliva</bp></m> then press it quite strongly on his
<bp>forehead</bp>. And thinking he has the piece on his
<bp>forehead</bp> due to the <sn>coolness</sn> of the
<m><bp>saliva</bp></m>, he will shake his <bp>ears</bp> &amp; will get
nowhere.</ab>
