<head><md>Against <bp>winds</bp>, colic, &amp;c</md></head>

<ab><m>Sap squeezed or water <del><ill/></del> distilled from
<pa>orange</pa> peel</m> is excellent <md>against the windy colic</md>.
<m>Candied peel</m>, too, is excellent <md>for the <bp>winds of the
<bp>belly</bp></bp></md>. And to make a trial of it, having poured <m>foaming
wine</m> in a <tl><m>glass</m></tl>, squeeze <m><pa>orange</pa>
juice</m> on the <m>wine foam</m>, which proceeds only from vapor &amp;
wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also,
if you squeeze <m>juice</m> against a <tl>candle</tl> it will burn all
the brighter.
