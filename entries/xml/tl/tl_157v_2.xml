<head>Molding a <al>bird</al></head>

<ab>One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
on a <tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl>, and hide &amp; sink within it half the
said <al>bird</al>, <add>in order</add> that it only shows one leg
&amp; one foot, then you will anoint it with <m>butter</m> to make it
hold the feathers down, finally <del>of<m>oil</m></del>
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. And then cast. And being set, clean &amp;
uncover whatever needs it. Next, mold the other side in the same way. But
because the feet, being of <m>bone</m> that is difficult to burn &amp; which
are not able to be cleaned neither by <m>quicksilver</m>
<del>If</del> nor by any other means, if the <tl>mold</tl> would not
open, uncover the bottom of the feet &amp; the toe or the little finger
of the claw, &amp; mold as a separate piece. Reheat &amp; open your
<tl>mold</tl> &amp; clean the <m>bones</m>. The feet usually remain too
weak to support the mass of a <al>solid bird</al>. And for this reason,
one adapts an <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl> in the <tl>mold</tl> of the
feet which passes into the body before casting; thus, they are
reinforced. Some mold the wings in a <tl>frame</tl>. Others mold the
head &amp; the said wings separately <fr>en noyau</fr>, then join &amp;
repair them to first model a form that will be stiff &amp; withstand the <m>tempered sand</m>.<hr/></ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

They are skinned &amp; filled with <tl><m>cotton cloth</m></tl>. &amp;
even better, one needs to dress them in the fashion that <pro>curriers</pro>
do, in order that they do not lose a <m>feather</m>, weight it. The
dressing is <m>alum</m> &amp; <m>paste of flour</m>.</ab>
