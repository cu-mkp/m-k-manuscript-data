<head>Molding promptly and reducing a hollow form to a relief</head>

<ab>You can imprint the relief of a medal in <m>colored wax</m>, &amp;
you will have a hollow form, in which you can cast <fr>en noyau</fr> a relief
<add>of your <m>sand</m></add>, on which you will make a hollow form of <m>lead</m>
or <m>tin</m>, in which you will cast a <m>wax</m> relief. And then on
that <m>wax</m> you will make your <tl>mold</tl>
<fr>en noyau</fr> hollow, to cast there the relief of <m>gold</m> &amp;
<m>silver</m> or any other <m>metal</m> you like. But to hasten your
work if you are in a hurry, make the first imprint &amp; hollow form in
<m>bread pith</m>, prepared as you know, which will mold very neatly.
And into that, cast in <m>melted wax</m>, which will give you a beautiful
relief on which you will make your <fr>noyau</fr>.</ab>
