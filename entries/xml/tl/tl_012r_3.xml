<ab>The whitest &amp; finest is the best. And when the hollow form is quite
clean, as of <m>sulfur</m> or <m>cooked <fr>chimol√©e</fr></m>, it is made
very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of <m>white</m> with a
border of <m>gold</m> to imitate <m>alabaster</m>. And after you have
applied the <m>white</m>, you can burnish it with the <tl>tooth</tl>.
But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to temper the <m>lead
white</m> with <m>glair of egg</m> &amp; <m>peelings from the <pa>fig
tree</pa></m>. Or better, varnish your work with <m>white varnish</m>.
Also, when you are molding with <m>paper</m>, as it starts to dry,
burnish from the back with the <tl>tooth</tl>.</ab>
