<m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m>mastic, pulverized &amp; passed delicately

oil</m> &amp; <m>mastic pulverized</m> at your discretion, until it has
enough body. <mark>+</mark><comment rid="c_112r_02"/></ab>

Which one knows when, being placed on a <tl>knife</tl> <env>in the
wind</env>, it does not run. This one is excellent for panels and is dry
within an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> and does not stick like the
<m>turpentine</m> one.</ab>
