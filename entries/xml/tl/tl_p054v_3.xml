  For keeping them from biting, it is good to have little
  <m>
   resin
balls
  </m>
  prepared like those of
  <pro>
   shoemakers
  </pro>
  &amp; to throw to
them as they yap at you, &amp; they will bite on the
  <m>
   balls
  </m>
  so
much that their teeth will be stuck together &amp; they will not be able
to hurt you.
