it have an open mouth, put some <m>cotton</m> inside, &amp; then on the
<m>cotton</m> some <m>melted wax</m>.</ab>
    

<ab>If by chance you want to mold this vile animal, &amp; if it were to
<m>piss</m> in your <bp>hand</bp>, it would burn your <bp>hand</bp>
&amp; itch, as if you had handled <pa>nettles</pa>. But the most
powerful <md>remedy</md> for this is to put your <bp>hand</bp> <env>into
fresh <m>earth</m></env> &amp; to cover it as if you wanted to bury it.
A <al>frog</al> is not so beautiful molded because it has lively skin,
&amp; the other has a lumpy one.</ab>

You can mold it hollow, and leaving under its belly an open notch, you
will make it jump with the <tl>twisted cord of the saw</tl>. Or else, if
it is small, put it on a <m>magnet</m> of its size, cut thinly, then
put it in <m>good vinegar</m>.</ab>
