<head>Casting for <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>

It is necessary that the <tl>molds</tl> be fiery red &amp; ablaze when
you cast in <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m>, or you burn flowers and
bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the
molded thing because the substance flows better when at ease and
without shaking the <tl>mold</tl>, &amp; does not become as porous.</ab>
