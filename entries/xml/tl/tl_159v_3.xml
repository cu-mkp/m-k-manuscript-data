<ab>Make the two sides so that they are, <del><fr>es</fr></del> if it is
possible, one as thick<del>ness</del> as the other, in order that they
can be quite evenly reheated. When you mold some animal that should be
burned <del>you</del>, like <al>crayfish</al>, you cannot open it to
clean it, &amp; make the cast so that it is not reheated. And when they
are reheated one time, keep them scarcely at all without casting, for
they are rendered musty &amp; humid, &amp; the <tl>mold</tl> is undone
&amp; loses its strength.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

The part where the back of the animal is is usually thicker.</ab>
