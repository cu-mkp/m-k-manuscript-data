<ab>It is much sooner made with <m>iron rust</m> than with
<m>filings</m>. For if the <m>vinegar</m> <add>is good</add>, you will
see it boil with large bubbles <del>as if it</del> on the <m>rust</m>,
as if it were on the fire; on the <m>filings</m>, it does not boil
unless it is put on the fire or <m>hot ashes</m>. However, when the
<m>filings</m> are passed through <m>vinegar</m>, &amp; you have made it
evaporate &amp; heat up, &amp; it is very red, if you do this again for a
second time, the <m>vinegar</m> will have much more strength, &amp; the
<m><la>crocum</la></m> will only be finer for it, &amp; redder. Those who
use it to cast in <m>gold</m> <del><fr>ven</fr></del> buy the
<ms>ounce</ms> for forty or fifty <ms><cn>sous</cn></ms>.</ab>

It does not harden the <tl>molds</tl>, and, in scraping, one cannot tell
that they are harder from it. But it makes the <tl>mold</tl> less dense,
and it drinks in and attracts the <m>gold</m> better.</ab>
