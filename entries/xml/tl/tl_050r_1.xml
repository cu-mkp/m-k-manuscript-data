hours</tmp></ms>. And when your <m>water</m> is cooled, throw it out &amp;
turn the opening upside down on a <tl>quite even <del>&amp;</del>
table</tl>, &amp; <env>in a room where there is not a drop of air &amp;

wax</m>, wrapped in <m>waxed canvas</m>, and adjust it to the
<tl>ampul</tl> quite precisely in order that it will be all ready to
stop it when you will have put in the fruit. And when you will have
delicately picked with your <bp>hand</bp> the <m>fruit</m> without it
