<ab>To clean the <tl><m>copper</m> plates</tl>, or to make worn ones
print better, boil them for four or five <ms><tmp>good hours</tmp></ms>
in a <m><add>good</add> lye</m> <add>quite spent in the <m>wash water</m></add>. 
Then make your <m>ink</m> with some <m><pa>linseed</pa>
oil</m> &amp; not with <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> &amp; press with the
<tl>rollers</tl>. The <tl><m>copper</m> plates</tl> are sooner made than
<tl><m>wood</m> blocks</tl>, but they are not so appropriate for
printing promptly. The <m>wood</m> ones are laborious but also will
sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other two. To
carve in <m>wood</m>, the secret is first to poach, that is to say to
lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the <tl><m>wood</m> block</tl>
&amp; to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the
<m>wood</m>. Once dry, you then gently rub with a <tl>moist
handkerchief</tl> the back of the <m>paper</m> which, by rubbing, will
become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next,
one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated
<m>glass</m> &amp; coat with <m><fr>noir dâ€™escaille</fr></m>, to then scrape
&amp; layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make <m>ink</m> for

<ab>which is different from that of the <pro>printers</pro>, one needs
to boil <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> or, even better, <m><pa>linseed</pa>
oil</m> for a <tmp>long time</tmp>. &amp; having boiled for a <tmp>long
time</tmp>, you will put in <m><pa>garlic</pa></m> &amp; <m>bread
crusts</m> to rid it of grease &amp; leave again to boil thoroughly,
then finally you put in one <ms>part</ms> of <m>lampblack</m> that you
have previously ground on <tl><m>marble</m></tl> with <m>oil</m>.
And finally you will mix everything <add>as long as</add> &amp; until
you see that the <tl>plate</tl> prints well. <del>Which</del> And when
you have spread the <m>ink</m> on it, wipe the <tl>plates</tl> well with
the surface of a <tl>piece of <m>white paper</m></tl>. &amp; do this
until the <tl><m>paper</m></tl> looks clean and then print. If you were
to wipe the <tl>plates</tl> with a <tl><m>linen</m> cloth</tl>, it would
remove the <m>ink</m>. <m><pa>Linseed</pa> oil</m> thickens while
boiling &amp; becomes like a <m>varnish</m> &amp; is in danger of
catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make sure it is in an
<env>open space</env> or in a <env>place where the flame cannot cause
damage</env>. Some burn <m>tartar</m> until it is black &amp; grind it
with <m>non-boiled <pa>linseed</pa> oil</m>, or <m><pa>walnut</pa>
oil</m> which others find to be better. This <m>black</m> is beautiful,
but the one of <m>lamp smoke</m> is blacker. When you want to print
<del><fr>fr</fr></del>, take with your <tl><bp>fingertip</bp></tl> of
the said <m>black moderately thick</m>, the whole <tl>plate</tl> having
first been cleaned in <m>lye</m> as said, then, rub it with the surface
of a <tl>piece of <m>white paper</m></tl> until the
<tl><m>paper</m></tl> remains white &amp; do not touch it with the
<bp>bare hand</bp> <del><fr>pourceq</fr></del> but with a <tl>piece
of <m>paper</m></tl> applied on top. &amp; having cleaned the
<tl>plate</tl> perfectly, <del><fr>mi</fr></del> rub again with a
<tl>piece of <m>paper</m></tl>, fold the edges &amp; sides. Next, take a
<tl>small even table</tl> &amp; on this a <tl>piece of
<m>felt</m></tl>, then a few <tl>sheets of <m>paper</m></tl> &amp;
finally the one you want to print on, which should be moistened between
two <tl>wet napkins</tl>. And on this <m>sheet</m> put your
<tl>plate</tl> then another piece of <tl><m>paper</m></tl>, &amp;
finally another<tl> <m>felt</m></tl>. Then pass between the
<tl>rollers</tl>. And you can print a dozen pieces consecutively by
always charging the <tl>plate</tl> with <m>ink</m> &amp; cleaning it as you
have done. But if you desist from printing, the rest of the <m>ink</m> will dry
in the grooves of the <tl>plate</tl>. Thus you will have to boil it
in <m>lye</m> or <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, as already said, to clean it. The
<tl>rollers</tl> must not be too loose.</ab>
