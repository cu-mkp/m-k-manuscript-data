<head>Excellent secret for molding hollow and very delicately in <m>fine
gold</m></head>

<ab>Cast with your aforesaid <m>sand</m> your animal and <al>lizard</al>
or other thing with <m>billon silver</m>, &amp; it will come out very
neat. <del>E</del> But take heed to mold it hollow, or at least leave a
small hole in its mouth<del><ill/></del> or in another place. Next,
<m>gild</m> it with <m>fine gold</m>, as uniform as it will be possible
for you, three or four or five times, &amp; until your <m>gold</m> has
the <ms>thickness of a piece of <m>paper</m></ms> or something similar,
&amp; all the scales will always show equally. Next, put it in good
<m>aquafortis</m>, which, by this hole, will corrode the <m>billon</m>,
&amp; the <m>gold</m> will remain hollow &amp; light &amp;
wonderful.</ab>
