  They are made better in crucible form,
  <del>
   hollow at the
  </del>
  narrower at the bottom &amp; becoming larger toward the muzzle. It is
necessary to
  <tl>
   pestle
  </tl>
  the
  <m>
   powder
  </m>
  thoroughly &amp; put on top of it either
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   cork
  </m>
  or better still a fitted plate of
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  thoroughly
  <tl>
   pestled
  </tl>
  on top, for it seals precisely &amp; makes for
greater force. The ball only makes a hole, the
  <m>
   powder
  </m>
  alone makes
more of an effect. One holds that, once loaded &amp; kept in a
  <env>
   dry place
  </env>
  for fifteen
  <tmp>
   days
  </tmp>
  , they have more force.
