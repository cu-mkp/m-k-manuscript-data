 For keeping

  candles

 from dripping and making them white
 <ab>
  Having made them, put into the
  <tl>
   mold
  </tl>
  <m>
   fresh water
  </m>
  well
beaten with
  <m>
   bran
  </m>
  , which should not at all be purged of its
  <m>
   flour

  , so that the
  <m>
   water

  becomes white. And dip your
  <tl>
   candles
  </tl>
  in that, then leave them to dry. And do thus two or three
times.
