<ab>They also make their <tl>molds</tl> from <m>metal</m> which lasts
longer &amp; molds more cleanly than <m><fr>grais</fr></m>,<comment rid="c_008v_02"/> because the
plate comes out without flashing &amp; smooth. But this is for the

<pro>rich</pro> because a <tl>mold</tl> costs fifteen or sixteen
<cn>frans</cn>. They are mainly made of <m>metal</m>, for basins &amp;
ewers &amp; salt cellars &amp; similar things which are fashioned.</ab>

<ab>For pints,<comment rid="c_030r_01"/> <tl>molds</tl> are made with
<m>white clay earth</m> mixed with <m><al>horse</al> dung</m> &amp; <m>cloth
waste</m> &amp; well beaten, because the pints, being sunk in a half round,
would not be able to release as well from the <tl><m><fr>grais</fr></m> mold</tl>
as from the <m>earth</m>, which is soft. One makes the <fr>noyau</fr> of 
the <tl>mold</tl> of the said pints in <m><fr>grais</fr></m>.</ab>

<ab>In <tl><m>metal</m> molds</tl>, one makes vents and casts all at once,
which is the reason that in the middle of the dish, no smoky black line
which comes from the vapor &amp; fumes of the <m>metal</m> that is cast,
which is the cause that in that spot, the work is lumpy &amp; very often
pierced. However they repair it with <m>solder</m> <del>of the 
<fr>n</fr></del>, as is said. These fumes are made right in the middle of the
cast, &amp; in <tl><m><fr>grais</fr></m> molds</tl>.</ab>

<ab>The plate can be <tl>hammered</tl> <del><fr>mar</fr></del> to make
it more vendable. But it will not last as long.</ab>

<ab>Depending on the size of their platters &amp; plates, they have
notches on the spoke of their <tl><m>iron</m> wheels</tl>. And when they
want to apply</ab>

<ab>any dish or plate, they loosen &amp; undo with the strike of a
<tl>hammer</tl> the <m>iron</m> wedges that slide along the spokes of
the <tl>wheel</tl>. And, when they are at the notch and points that they
need, they tighten the said wedges, wedging them with the
<tl>hammer</tl>.</ab>

<ab>When their plates or dishes have been cast, soldered if needed,
&amp; purged of surrounding flashing with the hot <tl>soldering
iron</tl> &amp; then with a large <tl>file</tl>, they adapt it on the
<tl>wheel</tl>; &amp; first of all they wrap their
<del><tl><fr>desgrusoue</fr></tl></del> <tl><fr>desgrusouer</fr></tl>
with a <tl>rope</tl>, as thick <corr><del><tl>rope</tl></del></corr> as
the <ms><bp>little finger</bp></ms>, &amp; lean it firmly on the
<tl>crossbar</tl> to secure it well. And while someone else promptly
turns the <tl>wheel</tl>, they guide the sharp edge of the
<tl><fr>esgrusouer</fr></tl> by <tl><bp>hand</bp></tl>
<del><fr>s</fr></del> toward the edge of the round hollow, &amp; gently
guide it to the center of the circle. And this
<tl><fr>desgrusouer</fr></tl> is for removing the first rough &amp;
lumpy skins of the work. And next they even it out with a<corr><del><fr>e</fr></del></corr> <tl>cutting
<m>iron</m></tl> called a <tl><fr>plane</fr></tl>, the sharp edge of which
they rub with a little <tl><m>putty</m></tl> on <tl><m>leather</m> nailed
onto a piece of <m>wood</m></tl> <del>having</del>, and this in such a way
that the flesh or grain is on the outside, for if the sharp edge of this
<tl><fr>plane</fr></tl> was not thus rubbed &amp; burnished, it would
not polish &amp; <del>not</del> burnish the <m>tin</m>,
<del><fr>au</fr></del> which would stay white, &amp; not black &amp;
burnished like a mirror. Moreover, they repair the work for the second
time with this <tl><fr>plane</fr></tl> as they did with the
<tl><fr>esgrusouer</fr></tl>. Then, with a <tl>knife</tl> or another
<tl>sharp <m>iron</m></tl>, they scrape the edges of the platters or
plates to smooth them so that they are not found sharp when handled</ab>

<ab>Their <tl>hammers</tl> must be quite even &amp; polished, and if by
chance the rust, <del>the</del> or some other use, has
damaged them, they first polish them with <tl><m>emery stone powder</m></tl>,
then they finish burnishing &amp; smoothing with the <tl><m>putty</m></tl>.
Otherwise they would not strike neatly. It is also necessary that the
surface of the <tl>anvils</tl> be the same.</ab>
