<ab>The usual <del><fr>bo</fr></del> good one is <m>the one which is
found in a <env>vineyard</env> near <pl>Puy David</pl></m>, but the one
which is most excellent is <m>the one from the <pl>Touch</pl>, near
<pl>Sainct Michel</pl> &amp; toward <pl>Blagnac</pl>, in a
<env>vineyard that is quite high up</env></m>. The latter is finer
&amp; a little fatter than the other, &amp; better for small works. It
does not want to be reheated too much.</ab>
