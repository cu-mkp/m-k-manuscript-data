  This is a
  <tl>
   well-furbished knife
  </tl>

  <tl>
   nailed

  through the
middle in such a way that it easily moves to one side &amp; the other

  </del>
  A, as readily as the side B, is hidden 
inside its
  <tl>
   handle
  </tl>
  marked C. The two tenons you see at the tip of
the
  <tl>
   knife
  </tl>
  are for locking it on one side or the other against a
  <tl>
   nail
  </tl>
  which is at the butt of the said
  <tl>
   handle
  </tl>
  , in order 
that, when one wants to press hard
  <add>
   on
  </add>
  something to
cut it, it does not come out from the
  <tl>
   handle
  </tl>
  . You may allow the
side marked B to cut for demonstration purposes,

   but not
much

  , but the side that is notched

  and marked A must
not cut.

  It is sufficient that it be furbished well. And
also the notch needs to be as thick as
  <ms>
   the back of a
   <tl>
    knife
   </tl>
  </ms>
  in order that it cannot cause
  <sn>
   pain

will only show the part of the
  <tl>
   knife

  which is not notched, for
the side with the notch needs to be

  hidden
inside the
  <tl>
   handle
  </tl>

  <bp>
   nose
  </bp>
  or a
  <bp>
   finger
  </bp>
  , pretend to sharpen your
  <tl>
   knife
  </tl>
  on the

   while

  doing this, turn the

  with one

   finger

your

   hand

  , and you will place the notch, colored with
  <m>
   brazilwood rosette
  </m>
  or
  <m>
   <pa>
    black cherry

   juice
