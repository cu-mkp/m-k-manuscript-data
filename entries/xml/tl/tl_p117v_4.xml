<head>Molding <fr>Ã  noyau</fr> figures of <m>wax</m> or medals of
<m>lead</m></head>

<ab>Rub them with <m>oil</m> with a <tl>paintbrush</tl>, but let
it be so lightly that your medal is almost rubbed dry &amp; that it
hardly appears to have been anointed. Next, <del><fr>destr</fr></del> rub
it with <m>eau-de-vie</m> and heat the <m>water</m> with which you will
temper your aforesaid <m>sand</m>, with <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp;
<m>alum</m>, in order that being <del><fr>chau</fr></del> as if lukewarm
when you cast it, the <m>oil</m> will not refuse it, as it does with
<m>cold water</m>, &amp; do not forget when moistening your <m>sand</m> to
always mix in it a little <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Medals mold in such a way very neatly.</ab>
