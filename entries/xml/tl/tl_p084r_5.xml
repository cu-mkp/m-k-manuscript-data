is necessary that it not be too humid for the aforesaid reasons. Reheat
little <add>by little</add>. And if, after molding it, you leave it to
dry slowly, in some <env>dry place</env> &amp; not over a big fire, it
would be better, for when one exposes it all at once to intense heat, it
warps. I believe that reheating it at the mouth of the <tl>oven</tl>,
<tmp>after the bread has been taken out</tmp>, would be very proper. One
ought not to complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it
withstands as many castings as you wish, because it renders itself as
hard as <m>marble</m>, &amp; you can polish it, &amp; the <tl>mold</tl>
cannot be spoiled. Once used, <tl>pestle</tl> &amp; <tl>sieve</tl> it again, yet
without being scrupulous to render it so fine,
<del><fr>I</fr></del> for having been passed only through a <tl>common
sieve</tl>, it has more force <del>than</del> and releases better, than
when it is so fine.</ab>

It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It is rendered better for
casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used a lot, one
ought to refresh it with new sand.</ab>
