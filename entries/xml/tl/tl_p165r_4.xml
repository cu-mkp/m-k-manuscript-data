<ab>When it is long to set &amp; dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty

causing flashing. That which is drawn from <env>lean soil</env> is the best.
<tl>Molds</tl> of <m>fatty plaster</m> ought not to be kept for a <tmp>long
time</tmp>, for they act like <m>fatty earth</m>, which when drying by itself,
cracks. <add>It is best to reheat them<lb/>
soon after they are made, &amp;
to cast. <m>Good plaster</m> keeps<lb/>
a <tmp>long time</tmp> in<lb/>

It needs to be well <m>oiled</m>, for it is more difficult to separate
the two halves of the <tl>molds</tl> than when it is mixed.</ab>
