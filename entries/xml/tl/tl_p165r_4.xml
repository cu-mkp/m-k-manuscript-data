  When it is long to set &amp; dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty
&amp; humid, which is what makes it contract in fire &amp; crack,
causing flashing. That which is drawn from
  <env>
   lean soil
  </env>
  is the best.
  <tl>
   Molds
  </tl>
  of
  <m>
   fatty plaster
  </m>
  ought not to be kept for a
  <tmp>
   long
time
  </tmp>
  , for they act like
  <m>
   fatty earth
  </m>
  , which when drying by itself,
cracks.

   It is best to reheat them
   <lb>
   </lb>
   soon after they are made, &amp;
to cast.

  It needs to be well
  <m>
   oiled

  , for it is more difficult to separate
the two halves of the

  than when it is mixed.
