<ab><m>Glass from <pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is smoother &amp; more even than
<m>plate glass</m> and it is sturdier &amp; more durable. But commonly
it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens
because the <pro>glassmakers</pro>, having made it, put it when totally
hot on <m><pa>straw</pa></m>, which stains it in this way. However, this
is removed with <m>varnish</m> &amp; <m>salt</m> &amp; other
<m>drugs</m> that the <pro>glassworkers</pro> put on. <m>Glass from <pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is sold by the <ms>bundle</ms><comment rid="c_020r_04"/> &amp; each
<ms><df>bundle</df></ms> is composed of three <ms>tablets</ms>.
The <ms>bundle</ms> costs usually x <cn>sous</cn>.
<m>Plate glass</m> is <del>sold in</del> made in <pl>France</pl>, it is
whiter &amp; clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from
<pl>Lorraine</pl>. It is also commonly blown &amp; in that case, it is
better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the
shape of a <tl>frame</tl>, because they cannot be set quite evenly.</ab>
