  for it loses its color. It is better
to choose whitish
  <m>
   vermilion

  than dark &amp; blackish. For
  <m>
   vermilion

  is commonly mixed with a little
  <m>
   lake

  , without
which it would hardly be different from
  <m>
   minium

  . But the pale 
casts more vivacity than the dark. It is not desiccative, &amp;
for this reason one mixes in

   calcined
