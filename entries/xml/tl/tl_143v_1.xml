<ab>They are molded like <al>crayfish</al> <fr>en noyau</fr>, first on
one side, that which is hollow being raised up with <m>clay</m>, &amp; then
one uncovers them from the other side &amp; one makes the second
casting. They can also be cast well in <tl>frames</tl>, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
<m>wax</m>, or else one fills the cavities that cannot release
with <m>wax</m> or <m>clay</m>.</ab>
