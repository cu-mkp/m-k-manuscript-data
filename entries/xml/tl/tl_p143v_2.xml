<ab>Because usually <m>filings</m> are mixed with <m>filth</m>, it
is good to redden them in the fire to burn the <m>impurities</m> and then
wash them in <m>clear water</m>. In this way, the dirt will go to the
top of the <m>water</m>, which you throw out, &amp; the <m>good
filings</m> will go to the bottom.</ab></div></entry>
