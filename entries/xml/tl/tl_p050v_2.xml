<head>Curried <m>steel</m> and <tl>files</tl></head>

<ab>The <m>steel</m> that <pro>farriers</pro> &amp; <pro><m>iron</m>
workers</pro> commonly use is not refined like that from
<pl>Germany</pl> or <pl>Biscay</pl>, which is reduced in hardness
<del><fr>p</fr></del> in the bath of <m>molten iron</m>, but
<del>only</del> in the <m>iron bars</m> which are transported in flat
ingots from the <env>forges of <pl>Foix</pl></env> &amp; elsewhere,
there is a harder &amp; whiter &amp; finer kind than the other, as it
comes from the <env>mine</env>. And the <pro>workers</pro> choose it
&amp; use it like the other <m>steel</m>. And because <corr><del>that</del></corr> it comes from
<m>common iron</m>, they call it <m>strong iron</m>. But it is not as
excellent as <m>purified steel</m> like that from <pl>Germany</pl> &amp;
<pl>Biscaye</pl>, which is sold in <ms>small beads</ms>. Some curry
<m>steel</m>, giving it a heating, then temper it <del>&amp;
<m>water</m></del> in a large quantity of <m>water</m>, then forge it.
&amp; <m>fine steel</m>, which is brittle, breaks and crumbles, &amp;
<m>iron</m> allows itself to be stretched. Thus they separate <m>the
finest steel</m>, <del>&amp;</del> which with another heating they
reduce to a mass. The <pl>Germans</pl> make their <tl>files</tl> from
<m>strong iron</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">One applies <m>steel</m> to tools
<del><fr>dess</fr></del> not on both sides, but underneath the part
where one sharpens &amp; whets them. &amp; in this part, they must be of
<m>very soft iron</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle"><pl>Levantines</pl> refine our
<m>steel</m> because their country does not provide them with any. And
they reheat it in a <tl>pot</tl> with <m>bitumen</m>, &amp;c.</ab></div></entry>
