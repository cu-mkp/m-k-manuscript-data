One ought not to put any into colors for it is so brisk and
penetrating that it makes the colors flake, which next come off. And for
this reason, <pro>painters</pro> use it to clean their <tl><m>oil</m>
paintbrush</tl> when they have become hard, for it renders them
soft &amp; clean immediately, penetrating the dry color which encrusts
them. Also, <pro>painters</pro>, sometimes envious of the work
undertaken by another, <tmp>in the evening</tmp> secretly pour a few
drops of <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> <del>on the</del> oil</m> on the top
edge of the panel such that, running down, it makes a stain that
penetrates as far as the <m>wood</m> &amp; makes the colors come off such
that, to make the work even &amp; of an equal composition, they are
forced to do everything again and thus lose their work.</ab></div>
