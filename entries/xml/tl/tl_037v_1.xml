For sowing <pa>melons</pa> well, it needs to be at the <tmp>end of a
moon cycle</tmp>, for otherwise they would bud too many leaves &amp;
not bear enough fruit. Make small <del><fr>e</fr></del> holes, <ms>two
<bp>fingers</bp> by two <bp>fingers</bp></ms>, with a <tl>stake</tl>
&amp; put in each two or three <m>seeds</m>. Next, take <m>very fine
earth</m> &amp; fill the holes lightly with it. Next, spread over
all the <ms>thickness of a <bp>thumb</bp></ms> of <df><oc>havets</oc></df>, that
is to say <pa>wheat</pa> <del><fr>fl</fr></del> chaff, in order that the
coming rain does not beat the earth &amp; prevent their birth.
<add><oc>Havets</oc> attract <al>field mice</al> who eat the seeds. And
for avoiding this, one must moisten them with <del><fr>s</fr></del> a
<m>decoction of <pa>wormwood</pa></m>.</add>
