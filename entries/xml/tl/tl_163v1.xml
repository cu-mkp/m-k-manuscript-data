<ab>The hairy cornicles that it has under its beak
<del><fr>coe</fr></del> tend to come out lumpy &amp; not neat because,

the <m>metal</m> from running well therein, &amp; for that reason, one
makes a small gate of <m>wax</m> thread at the tips of them, both to
hold them up and to blow out the <m>ash</m> that hinders.</ab>

Spare no <tl>pins</tl>, placing them not only in the middle of the body
but also on the big legs, and two or three at the tail, according to the
stance that you want to give it.</ab>
