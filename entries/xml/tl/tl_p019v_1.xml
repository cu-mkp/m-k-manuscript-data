You know how to draw a circle correctly with the <tl>quill</tl> &amp; or
else with the <tl><bp>nail of your right thumb</bp></tl> &amp; the bent
<tl><bp>big finger</bp></tl>. If you do not have a <tl>ruler</tl>, fold
<m>paper</m> in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw
a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly without a <tl>compass</tl>,
fold your <m>paper</m> such that the fold <del><fr>e</fr></del> gives
you a straight line, at the <ms>required distance</ms> from which, trace
a point <del>&amp; a</del> or a line &amp; saturate it well with
<m>ink</m>. Then fold again the <m>paper</m> &amp; rub it on the back

l</fr></del>, A is the line without <m>ink</m> which the <m>paper</m>
fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is
printed.<lb/>
