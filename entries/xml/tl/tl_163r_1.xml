<ab>They readily put <ms>half</ms> of <m>amber</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms>
of <m>musk</m> &amp; very little <m>civet</m>, because <m>amber</m>
always overtakes the principal <sn>scent</sn> of <m>musk</m>.</ab>

<ab>To spare the <m>amber</m>, they readily put a little <m>musk</m> in
the white layers, <corr><del>&amp;</del></corr> <del>for <fr>l</fr></del> which gives a more
forceful <sn>scent</sn>. But to remove <del>the</del> or hide the
blackness of the <m>musk</m>, they put in a bit of <m><pa>wheat</pa>
starch from <pl>England</pl></m>, which is perfectly white.</ab>

To perfume with <m>white amber</m> in the <pl>Portuguese</pl> fashion, take a
<fr>huchau</fr> of <m>amber</m>, well broken up. And having put in a
<tl>small <m>silver</m> bowl</tl> a <del><m>silver</m></del>
<tl><ms>spoonful</ms></tl> of <m>flower oil</m>, or lacking that,
<m><fr>ben</fr> oil</m>, that is to say, a <env><tl><m>silver</m>
spoon</tl> that one uses at the table</env>, put in your
<m>ambergris</m> &amp; place all on a low fire, and it will melt quickly
if your <m>amber</m> is good, &amp; it will remain there without lumps.
Once all melted, put in <ms>the size of a pine nut</ms><comment rid="c_163r_03"/> of
<m>civet</m>, &amp; make it melt, &amp; mix it well together. Next, take
your <tl>gloves</tl>, well-cleaned &amp; well-dried, &amp; dipping the
<tl>tip of your <bp>finger</bp></tl> very lightly <del>on</del> on the
edge of the <m>oil</m>, spread it on the <tl>glove</tl>, little by little
&amp; with patience, &amp; rub the <tl>glove</tl> between your
<bp>hands</bp>, &amp; trace the fingers &amp; the stitches, one after
the other. And leave it to dry. Next, trace again as before until the
<m>amber</m> is all laid down.</ab>
