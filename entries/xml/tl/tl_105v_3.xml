<ab>For trapping them, one needs to observe their nature, the food that
they like the best, &amp; the <tmp>season of their pleasure</tmp>. The
<al>nightingale</al>, as long as it sings, maintains a territory for
itself alone. Therefore approach, making as if searching the ground for
something. And taking some <al>worms</al> which come from old meal or
from beneath <tl>kneading troughs</tl> or <tl>mills</tl>, which the
<al>nightingale</al> is fond of, put some on your <tl>hat</tl> attached
with a <tl>pin</tl> or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five
or six <ms>paces</ms> from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the
ground &amp; put in some <al>worms</al> and your <tl>device of little
crossed sticks</tl>. It will be anxious for you to leave so it can go
see what you have done, and seeing <al>worms</al>, it will enter.</ab>

Some sell <al>nightingales</al> on trees.</ab>

and the morning</tmp>, near fountains &amp; shaded places</env>, are
more appropriate for taking them.</ab>
