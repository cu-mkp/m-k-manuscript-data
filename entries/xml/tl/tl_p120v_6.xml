  a sign that it has some humidity, &amp; if the flower also had some
aquosity, it would rot. It also ought not to be
  <del>
   too
  </del>
  coarse,
for with its heaviness it would weigh down the flower &amp; make it lose
its form. Having thus chosen it as is needed, take a
  <tl>
   box
  </tl>
  , in
which you first make a mound of the said
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  , on which you will set the
stalk of your flower,
  <del>
   in such a way
  </del>
  laid down so that the flower
touches neither the bottom nor the sides of the
  <tl>
   box
  </tl>
  , but
remains in the air. Then, weigh down the stalk with more
  <del>
   on
  </del>
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  in order that it remains firm &amp; fixed. Finally, take some of the
same
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  &amp; with two
  <tl>
   <bp>
    fingers
   </bp>
  </tl>
  pulverize &amp; cast
it delicately on the flower,

  </del>
  imitating in that the flow of
an
  <ms>
   <tl>
    hourglass

  . And when the flower is as if
  <del>
   half
  </del>
  covered, strike your
  <bp>
   <tl>
    fist
   </tl>
  </bp>
  on the table
where the
  <tl>
   box
  </tl>
  is set in order that the
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  drops &amp; enters
everywhere. Finally, cover it all over and thus lay in other flowers,
in order, one over the other, as many as your
  <tl>
   box
  </tl>
  can contain.
That being thus arranged, expose it for
  <ms>
   <tmp>
    several
days
   </tmp>
  </ms>
  to
  <env>
   hot sun
  </env>
  . And while the flower dries, the
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  , which ever accompanies it &amp; holds it, does not allow that in
contracting, it shrivels &amp; closes in on itself, but it must dry in the same state as when you put it there. Now
take heed that you choose for that effect
