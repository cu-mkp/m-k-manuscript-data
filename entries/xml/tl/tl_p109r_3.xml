<head>Molding <m>wax</m></head>

<ab>In order that your <tl>mold</tl> grips without repelling in any place on
a shape or image of <m>wax</m>, you need to anoint it with <m>oil</m>
and moisten your <m>sand</m> with <m>lukewarm water</m>, for the <m>cold
water</m> would repel the <m>oil</m> more &amp; would not have a good seating on it.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">



Anoint well, very lightly, with <m>oil</m>, so little that it hardly
appears. Then, rub with some <m>eau-de-vie</m>. Next, moisten your <m>sand</m>
with <m>lukewarm water</m> so that it does not repel the
<m>oil</m>.</ab>
