<head>Foundry casting</head>

<ab>One casts candlesticks and small works in a <tl>frame</tl> with
<m>sand</m>. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles it with
<m>flour</m> in order to make the <del><fr>e metal</fr></del><comment rid="c_128r_03"/>
<m>copper</m> or <m>latten</m> run better. When the <m>sand</m> has been used
for a <ms>month</ms>, it is necessary to take some new, because the one
that was used, being reheated <del>in fire</del>
<mark>+</mark>,<comment rid="c_112r_02"/> dries out &amp; loses its bond. However,
it is used to mix among the new, for it makes the work not so porous.
One casts large works such as <wp>artillery</wp>, bells &amp; similar things in
<m>earth</m>, &amp; <m>copper</m> cast in <m>earth</m> makes less of a
crust, and is whiter than the one cast in <m>sand</m>. The
<m>earth</m> is <m>sandy clay</m> mixed with <m><al>horse</al> dung</m>
&amp; <m>cloth waste</m>. That which <del>is</del> has been used for
founding, which is black, cooked &amp; as if burnt, is
<del>cast</del> mixed with <m>artificial sand</m>, &amp; is
very good. <mark>/</mark> <add>To soften<comment rid="c_015r_01"/> &amp; make the <m>copper</m> run, throw in,
once it is melted, a little <m>lead</m>, which does not form an alloy
but is found on the surface of the cast.</add></ab>
