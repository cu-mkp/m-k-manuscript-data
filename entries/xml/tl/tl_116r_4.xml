After you have cast or beaten in <m>gold</m> the thin leaves of a
<pa>rose</pa> or other things, if you want to <m>enamel</m> them, you
need to <m>solder</m> or braze your delicate <m>gold</m> leaves onto
<m>silver strips</m>, which <del><fr>uy</fr></del><comment rid="c_116r_07"/> will strengthen them
to support the <m>enamel</m>. Next, once the thing has been
<m>enameled</m>, put the work in <m>aquafortis</m> <del><fr>d</fr></del>,<comment rid="c_116r_08"/> which will eat away the
<m>silver</m> &amp; leave all the <m>gold</m> with its <m>enamel</m>.
For this, the <m>gold</m> needs to be passed with <m><fr>ciment real</fr></m>.
