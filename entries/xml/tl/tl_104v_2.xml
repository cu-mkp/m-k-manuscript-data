<head>For casting</head>

<ab>If you have some piece which will not release &amp; is big,
mold it with <m>wax</m>, either in hollow or in relief, because it is
malleable once soft &amp; obeys, and thus separates itself from the
piece without leaving anything. But take heed that the <m>melted wax</m>
be neither too hot nor too cold. Some mold with <m>wax</m> heated in
<m>hot water</m>, but in pressing, the <tl>mold</tl> becomes clumsy 
&amp; makes itself false. When you have the hollow <m>wax</m> form, you can cast in some
<m>very soft clay</m> &amp; thoroughly moistened &amp; clear, &amp; let it dry
at ease. Then you will make a hollow form on it <del><fr>ave</fr></del> of
<m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, in <del>you</del> which what you will
form will be of good release.</ab>
