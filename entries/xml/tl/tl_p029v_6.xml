<ab>Take a well chosen tear of it which shows off its transparent red.
And in a <tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl> put the best <m>eau-de-vie</m> you can find, in <ms>sufficient quantity</ms>. <del>For
it</del> And stop it well and so diligently that it does not vent,
otherwise it would be worth nothing. And leave it thus for <ms><tmp>a
long time</tmp></ms>, because the longer it stays <del>there</del>, the
more beautiful &amp; better it will be &amp; it will dissolve if it is
good, otherwise it will become like <m>wine lees</m>. When you want to use
it, make a small hole in the <tl>stopper of the bottle</tl> &amp; pour a
little &amp; stop it again each time, then apply it on <m>gold</m>.</ab>

<ab>The <m>good kind of <al>dragon</al>&#8217;s blood</m> can be found in
large pieces like pieces of cake <add>this one has no value and is
adulterated</add>, &amp; once broken it shows on its edges scales,
transparent as <del><fr>ro</fr></del> <m>rouge clair enamel</m>, it is
also lumpy in some parts like small <m>rubies</m>. The <m>eau-de-vie</m> needs to be very ardent &amp;
passed<comment rid="c_029v_01"/> several times.</ab>

I put it in <m>common eau-de-vie</m>, mixing in some
<m>aquafortis</m> to give it strength. At the beginning the
<m>water</m> took on a slight tint, but at the end there was only an
appearance of <m>tragacanth gum</m> with which I think they adulterate
the <m><al>dragon</al>&#8217;s blood</m>.</ab>

When it is applied on <m>burnished gold</m>, it is prone to break. For
this reason, some coat it with <m>turpentine varnish</m>. Cold delays
the action of the <m>water</m> and the extraction of the color. And for
this reason, one can keep it close to the fire.</ab></div></entry>
