  Once they are white, one only needs to clean

  them
well, then put them in the fire, &amp; make them pass to blue. And one
needs to take good care that they do not pass too far beyond blue, for
neither gold nor silver nor any color would take on it. To do this,

  one takes
a

  , which one covers with
thoroughly lit charcoal, &amp; thus one heats them quite strongly for an

    hour

  </ms>
  or two, and when the
  <m>
   ashes
  </m>
  are very hot,
one pulls the charcoal to one side &amp; one puts the
  <wp>
   guard
  </wp>
  where the
charcoal was, &amp; one covers it completely with
  <m>
   ashes

  . And when
the body of the
  <wp>
   guard
  </wp>
  , which is the main thing, is completely passed,
one rotates the
  <wp>
   guard
  </wp>
  onto the other side, and in this manner, the grey
cannot pass too much, unless some

   hot charcoal

  touches it. The
grey can be done well in the

  a little, but
it is still grey in some places. After blue comes grey.
