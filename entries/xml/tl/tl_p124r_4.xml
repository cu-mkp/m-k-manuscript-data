  Fine gold
 </m>
 <ab>
  There is a property of
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  which, even though it is very fine
&amp; unalloyed &amp; has been passed through
  <m>
   aquafortis
  </m>
  &amp;
  <m>
   antimony
  </m>
  , is nevertheless so brittle that it hardly withstands the
  <tl>
   hammer
  </tl>
  . And the composition of
  <m>
   verdet
  </m>
  , described above to
make
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  run, makes it as soft as
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  .
