  Whitening
 </m>
 <ab>
  If it is for
  <m>
   silver
  </m>
  , do not pestle your
  <m>
   tartar
  </m>
  with
  <m>
   iron
  </m>
  but with the
  <tl>
   handle of a hammer
  </tl>
  , for if you touch
&amp; dip
  <m>
   iron
  </m>
  in your
  <m>
   whitening
  </m>
  , the
  <m>
   silver
  </m>
  would
become red like
  <m>
   copper
  </m>
  &amp; you would need to reheat it &amp;
put it again in
  <m>
   whitening
  </m>
  . Mix nothing with your
  <m>
   tartar
  </m>
  that should not enter the
  <m>
   whitening
  </m>
  , for this corrupts it. Do not
let it spill out of its first boil, for in this is all its strength. The
  <m>
   whitening
  </m>
  is made with one
  <ms>
   part
  </ms>
  <m>
   pulverized tartar
  </m>
  &amp; a
  <ms>
   half
  </ms>
  of
  <m>
   common salt
  </m>
  .
