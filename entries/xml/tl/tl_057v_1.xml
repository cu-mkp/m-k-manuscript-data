<ab><pro>Sheath makers</pro> use <m>small, very delicate skins of
<al>lambs</al> and young <al>goats</al></m>, almost like
<m>parchment</m> and keep them constantly re-moistened in <env>humid
places</env>. When they want to imprint some history, they layer them in
the hollows of their figure, then put over the top <m>fine fatty
earth</m> with which cloths are rid of grease, having pressed &amp; beaten
it well &amp; rendered it moderately humid and soft. Then they put on
the <m>earth</m> a <tl>small even board</tl> and put the whole in a
<tl>press</tl> and let it dry there. After the
<m>earth</m>, only the <m>leather</m> remains neatly imprinted <gap/> of
the <ms>size of a <pa>pea</pa></ms>. And then you give the
<m>leather</m> two or three layers of <m>copperas black</m> and
<m>iron scale</m>, one after the other, as even as the
<pro>tanners</pro> do. And this <m>dye</m>, being astringent, makes the
<m>leather</m> shrink &amp; strengthens it and makes it imprint better.
Once dry, one <m>glues</m> <m>canvas</m> on the back with <m>strong glue</m>. 
In this manner one can promptly imitate big statues &amp;
very subtle medals and paint &amp;
decorate<comment rid="c_057v_03"/> them &amp; are light and portable
&amp; last a <tmp>long time</tmp>. That which is imprinted on a relief
is done differently and can be retraced with a <tl>hot
<m>iron</m></tl>.</ab></div>
