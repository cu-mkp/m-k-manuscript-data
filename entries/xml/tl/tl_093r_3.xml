<head>Grafts</head>

<ab>It is necessary that the graft be not from old wood, for it is never
a beautiful tree.</ab>

<ab>One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
it has more, its strength is weakened. The <env>wind</env> torments it, &amp; it
does not have enough strength to bud.</ab>

<ab>Trees which have coarse marrow, like <pa>peach trees</pa> &amp; all
their kind &amp; <pa>plum trees</pa>, do not want grafts <env>in
freezing weather</env> because the cold damages their marrow, which one
also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
graft.</ab>

<ab>All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree is sapping,
for the <md>humor</md> grows them quickly. Otherwise
<del><fr>au</fr></del>, they dry before the <md>humor</md> of
the sap pushes them.</ab>
