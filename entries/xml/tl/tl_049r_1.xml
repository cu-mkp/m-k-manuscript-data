<head><m>Casting of lead</m></head>

<ab>Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of
<env>churches</env>, <del>in it</del> melt <del>one</del> for one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>tin</m> a half of <m>lead</m>, &amp;
cast in <m>stone</m>, &amp; if they want their work whiter, they put
<del><fr>p</fr></del> <ms>half</ms> <m>tin</m> and <ms>half</ms> <m>lead</m>, but
the first mixture is the best, &amp; does not become porous. One needs
to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others <m>smoke</m>
their <tl>molds</tl> with a <tl><m>resin candle</m></tl> to cast neatly. The
<m>antimony</m> makes the substance brittle &amp; breakable. The
<m>looking-glass tin</m> makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as
for <m>tin</m>, it works well <del>to the</del> with <m>pure lead</m>.
Those who make very neat <m>lead</m> casts, use <tl>puncheon</tl>.
<pro>Pewterers</pro> cast in a <tl><m>copper</m> mold</tl>.<comment rid="c_032v_01"/> One says
that one makes <m>lead</m> take hold on <m>glass</m> with
<m>resin</m>. Some put into the <m>lead</m> a <ms>quarter</ms> of
<m>tin</m>. <m>Looking-glass tin </m> renders the work stronger.</ab>
