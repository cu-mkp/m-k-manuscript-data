  To alloy well
  <m>
   tin
  </m>
  &amp;
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  , one needs to melt one by
itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it
often on the
  <tl>
   <m>
    marble
   </m>
  </tl>
  or the
  <tl>
   <m>
    square tile
   </m>
  </tl>
  .
And when you will see it become quite even
  <del>
   like
  </del>
  &amp; shiny
as if it were burnished, it is good. For sometimes it becomes spotted
due to too much
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  &amp; sometimes due to too much
  <m>
   tin
  </m>
  .
There is some
  <m>
   tin
  </m>
  which takes more
  <m>
   lead
  </m>
  than another.
  <m>
   Common tin

  is the one that is mixed with
