<ab>Is made on a <tl>blade of <m>iron</m> reddened in the fire</tl>. And
the <m>oil</m> drips off, which is appropriate for anointing the hair of
a <al>butterfly</al> or similar thing, for this <m>oil</m> is instantly
dry &amp; makes the remainder dry out. It is necessary that the hair or
down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, for being upright, it
would elevate the <m>sand</m> &amp; become porous.</ab>

If you want to mold
something delicate, like a <pa>pansy</pa>, some, to give it a little
thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with <m>butter</m>. But it
is best to anoint it with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, for it has no body,
&amp; does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the
flower firm.</ab></div></entry>
