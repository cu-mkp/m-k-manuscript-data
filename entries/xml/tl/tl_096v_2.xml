<head>Color of water</head>

<ab><add>For</add> the color of water, one passes a <tl>soft file</tl>
on the guards to whiten them, then the <tl>burnisher</tl>. Next, one
makes them pass to blue until they turn grey. Next, when they are still
moderately hot, one passes the <m>bloodstone</m> over them, and when
they cool, one turns them to reheat them, for the color of water is made
only in several passes. And if the guards were not warm, the
<m>bloodstone</m> would scrape &amp; undo the color. One needs to take
heed that the guards do not pass too far beyond grey, for they would throw
off <m>filth</m> that would prevent the color from taking. One needs almost one
<ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms> for preparing, softening &amp; setting the
color of water, but as they pass a little beyond blue, it is enough for
grey &amp; another color. Grey is the lesser color after <m>varnish</m>,
which is of two colors, either yellow or black.</ab>
