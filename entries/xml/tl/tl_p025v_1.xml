  There are three reinforcement rings on a
  <wp>
   cannon
  </wp>
  , one at the breech,
one in the middle, one at the mouth. When
  <pro>
   founders
  </pro>
  want to work on their
craft or render the
  <wp>
   cannon
  </wp>
  or other
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  lighter &amp; easier
  <add>
   to
cart around
  </add>
  , they make it from the ring at the breech to the ring
in the middle of the thickness &amp; proportion of the balls, as is said
above. But from the ring in the middle to the ring of the mouth
  <del>
   &amp;
  </del>
  they diminish it one
  <ms>
   line
  </ms>
  , or more or less, on
each side, always taking their measurements with the
  <tl>
   compass
  </tl>
  <add>
   from
  </add>
  the straight line which they make in the middle of the
  <tl>
   model of
   <m>
    paper
   </m>
  </tl>
  or otherwise. And this reduction amounts
to seven or eight
  <ms>
   quintals
  </ms>
  <del>
   reduction &amp;
lightening
  </del>
  <add>
   in weight
  </add>
  , and the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  is not less secure
for it. This is done for
  <wp>
   big pieces
  </wp>
  , but for
  <del>
   <fr>
    gr
   </fr>
  </del>
  <wp>
   small pieces
  </wp>
  <del>
   from
  </del>
  <add>
   lesser than
  </add>
  the average, one
needs to observe the aforesaid proportion, &amp; draw the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  in a
continuous line from one end to the other. The trunnions are commonly
situated one
  <bp>
   <ms>
    foot
   </ms>
  </bp>
  from the ring of the middle,
  <del>
   from
  </del>
  toward the edge of the breech.

But because some
  <pro>
   gunners
  </pro>
  prefer a
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  which is weighted at the front
because it is easier to plant, to do this, one only needs to move the
trunnions closer to the breech &amp; further away from the middle. On
the contrary, if you want to render it
  <del>
   <fr>
    s
   </fr>
  </del>
  <add>
   more
  </add>
  weighted at the back, you will move the trunnions

closer to the middle of the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  or place them further up toward the
mouth. When you bore your
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  you make a fluted
  <m>
   cast iron
  </m>
  box
like a bedpost &amp; there ought to be sixteen channels or notches in
which you will slot sixteen
  <tl>
   blades
  </tl>
  quite evenly,
  <del>
   with
  </del>
  in order that all together they cut &amp; scrape in the
same manner. Because if some were to not cut &amp; scrape, chambers
&amp; waves would be made in the
  <wp>
   cannon
  </wp>
  which would make it lopsided and
there would be a danger that the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  might break in the middle. In
order to avoid this, it is necessary that the
  <tl>
   borer
  </tl>
  should pass
evenly from the breech to the mouth, &amp; that the opening of the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  should be evenly bored from one end to the other, because thus the
  <m>
   powder
  </m>
  goes off all at once with more force. On the contrary, if
restrained, it goes sideways &amp; makes the
  <wp>
   piece
  </wp>
  break.
