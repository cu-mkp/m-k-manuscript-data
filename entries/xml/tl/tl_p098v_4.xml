<ab>Which have been fed by the <tl>rod</tl> do not whistle among the
company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them to whistle well, one needs to take them from the nest before they can
see &amp; cover them with <m>down</m> or a <m><al>hare</al> skin</m>. Thus,
having not seen their father and known his voice, they better learn the whistle
that one teaches them.</ab>
