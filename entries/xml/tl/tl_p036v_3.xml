<ab>One says that in <pl>Lorraine</pl> &amp; in <pl>Flanders</pl>
<m>well-made glass</m> is made of <m><pa>fern</pa> ashes</m> &amp;
<m>pebbles</m>, and first they blow a long bubble, which another
<pro>worker</pro>, with long shears, cleaves &amp; cuts lengthwise.
Then, having set this long, cleft bubble on a <tl><m>stone</m></tl> or
large <tl>plate</tl> that is in the <tl>furnace</tl>, a little less
hot than for the melt, it is left to stretch out. And again in
addition to this, they flatten it with a long &amp; <tl>thick round
<m>iron</m> rod</tl>, then they remove it to the <tl>annealing furnace</tl>. 
It is made in the same way in <pl>England</pl> more beautifully.
Near <pl>Rouen</pl> in <pl>France</pl>, <m>plate glass</m> is made with
some <del>salt of</del> <m><pa>saltwort</pa></m> &amp; <m>pebbles</m>,
that is whiter &amp; more delicate than that of <pl>Lorraine</pl>. For
<m>plate glass</m> can be melted with a <tl>candle</tl> &amp; not that
from <pl>Lorraine</pl>. That of plate is blown in a long bubble, of which
another cuts the end, then the blower flattens it while turning it &amp;
while touching it to a surface that is on the ground,
<del><fr>A</fr></del> then puts it to anneal.<comment rid="c_036v_01"/> Thus the
middle, whence it is begun, still remains.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

The <m>glass</m> can be cleft again with the light of a <tl>candle</tl>
by wetting, but not as precisely as with the <tl>hot <m>iron</m></tl>.</ab>
