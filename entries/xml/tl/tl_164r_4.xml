<head>Blowing</head>

<ab>

When you melt <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>gold</m>, do not blow strongly
&amp; with violence, because with the <m>charcoal</m>
consolidating, the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> would lower &amp;
<del>the silv</del> could fall over. But when your <tl>mold</tl> is
ready, at that moment, blow strongly to heat well the <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with
<tl>small bellows</tl>, especially <m>gold</m>, for this removes their
<m>fumes</m> &amp; softens them. </ab>
