<ab><m><add><pa>Walnut</pa></add> oil</m> mixed with as much of
<m>turpentine</m> &amp; distilled through an <tl>alembic</tl> renders an
essence whiter than <m>common water</m>. But this has no body &amp; does
not give bond to colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
the color without hold and fading. These, imbibing in this way,
would not give you leisure to work and soften any more than in <m>distemper</m>. But
you mend this defect by giving it a little body with
<m>turpentine</m>, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
work with <m><fr>azur d'esmail</fr></m> &amp; will make a perfect
<m>lead white</m>. <m>Turpentine varnish</m> made with this <m>oil</m>
is dry in one <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms>.</ab>
