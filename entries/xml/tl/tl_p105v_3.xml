  For trapping them, one needs to observe their nature, the food that
they like the best, &amp; the
  <tmp>
   season of their pleasure
  </tmp>
  . The
  <al>
   nightingale
  </al>
  , as long as it sings, maintains a territory for
itself alone. Therefore approach, making as if searching the ground for
something. And taking some
  <al>
   worms
  </al>
  which come from old meal or
from beneath
  <tl>
   kneading troughs
  </tl>
  or
  <tl>
   mills
  </tl>
  , which it is fond of, put some on your
  <tl>
   hat
  </tl>
  attached
with a
  <tl>
   pin
  </tl>
  or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five
or six
  <ms>
   paces
  </ms>
  from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the
ground &amp; put in some
  <al>
   worms
  </al>
  and your
  <tl>
   device of little
crossed sticks
  </tl>
  . It will be anxious for you to leave so it can go
see what you have done, and seeing
  <al>
   worms
  </al>
  , it will enter.

more appropriate for taking them.
