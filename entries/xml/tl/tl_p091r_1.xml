<head>Grafting</head>

<ab>With any tree that has coarser marrow, <add>the graft</add> is awkward
to <del>be</del> cut <add>well</add>, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, &amp; if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the <pa>vine</pa>, from all
<pa>peaches</pa> &amp; <pa>apricots</pa>.</ab>

<ab><pa>Apricot trees</pa> have a very thin bark, &amp; thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of <pa>prune trees</pa> &amp; <pa>almond trees</pa>.</ab>

<ab>The grafts scarcely <del><ill/></del> take if the cut of the tree is
wet. One needs then to graft in <env><fr>serain</fr> &amp; mild
weather, &amp; not too cold &amp; windy</env>.</ab>

<ab>Old wood that one leaves to the graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made &amp; of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, &amp; if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood <del>than the young</del> better, because it is harder than
the young. <comment rid="c_091r_02"/>But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile &amp; short &amp; slow to
grow.</ab></div></entry>
