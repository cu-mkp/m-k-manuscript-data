<head><m>Sand of <m><la>crocum</la></m></m></head>

One can use the mixture of <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m> in
<tl>molds</tl> for <m>silver</m> as well as for <m>gold</m>, for it
firms them &amp; keeps them from cracking &amp; making flashing. And I
believe that for flat things it would withstand <del>well
<fr>de</fr></del> several casts, which, however, for <m>gold</m> &amp;
<m>silver</m> is hardly practiced.</ab>

Try, for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>, <m><la>crocum</la></m>.</ab>
