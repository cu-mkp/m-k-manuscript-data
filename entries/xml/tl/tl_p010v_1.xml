<head>For painting in <m>oil</m> on <m>taffeta</m> <add>without the
<m>oil</m> running</add></head>

<ab>One needs to make a layer of <m><fr>batture</fr></m>, which is made
<del>of well-cooked honey &amp; <m>turpentine</m></del> of <m>strong glue</m> 
soaked for 24 <ms>hours</ms> in <m>water</m> then gently
brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little
<m>honey</m> to soften it, &amp; make it boil all together. And on top
of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in
<m>oil</m>, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also
serve you to make a seat for <m>gold</m>. <m>Alum water</m> also
keeps <m>oil</m> from running.</ab>
