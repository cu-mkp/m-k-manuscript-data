<head><m>Varnish</m> for <m>distemper</m></head>

<ab>You can make <m>marble</m> with <m>distemper</m> of <m>lake</m> or
<m>rose of <pl>Ghent</pl></m> &amp; <m>chalk</m>. Once dry, glaze with
<m>lake</m> tempered in <m>wine</m>, for the <m>glue</m> makes it die &amp;
blacken. And all will appear red, but the <m>varnish</m> you will
put here, which will penetrate, will make appear dark &amp; light
that which ought to be thus. The <m>varnish</m> is made thus, mix with <m>clear
<pl>Venice</pl> turpentine</m> some <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>
<del>&amp;</del> until all is clear &amp; liquid enough, &amp; it is done
without fire. This one <del><fr>es</fr></del> is for things in
<m>distemper</m>, and the <m>turpentine varnish</m> that you know, for
panels. <m>Pure <pa>spike lavender</pa> oil varnish</m> is not good for
panels, for <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> is too penetrating &amp;
makes colors sparkle, unless it was made <tmp>long ago</tmp>.</ab>
