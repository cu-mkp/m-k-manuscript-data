<ab>You can mold with it as large a piece as you please. But if you take
your <tl>molds</tl> from large works &amp; pieces of <m>wood</m>, it
will not release well unless you <del>boil</del> make your <m>wood</m>
imbibe <m>very hot wax</m>. For the <m>wood</m> absorbs &amp; drinks
&amp; in this way attracts the <m>plaster</m>. You can assume the same
thing for any other large piece of work. But the cure is to
<del><fr>l’ab</fr></del> saturate <del><fr>l’ouvra</fr></del> with <m>very
hot wax</m> the work on which you want to cast your <m>plaster</m>. For
by this means, it will not drink it up &amp; will release very
neatly.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

If the <m>plaster</m> shrinks, it will always make flashing. Seek the hard
kind and <del>it</del> put your <tl>molds</tl> well in the <tl>press</tl> before
casting.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">It is not good when it
shrinks.</ab></div>
