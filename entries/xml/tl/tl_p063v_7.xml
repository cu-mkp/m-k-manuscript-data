<head>Softening</head>

<ab>If you have worked &amp; made your ground with some
desiccative color, such as <m>minium</m> &amp; similar, finish softening
while the work is fresh, for if you were to wait until <tmp>the next
day</tmp>, it would be dry &amp; you would not be able to finish it
neatly.</ab>
