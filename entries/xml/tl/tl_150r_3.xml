<ab>They are less subject to cracking while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than when they are of little thickness, provided that
the thickness is sufficient. For being thin, they scarcely need to be
<del><fr>recui</fr></del> on the fire, &amp; a long time on the fire
makes them corrupt, especially when the <m>plaster</m> is not
strong.</ab>

<ab>It is better to reheat a <tl>mold</tl> on its own than several
together, because one needs a larger &amp; more violent fire for several
than for one. And, <m>glowing charcoal</m> stopping up the space between
the <tl>molds</tl>, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such
a way that more often you will find your <tl>molds</tl> burst &amp;
cracked on one side more than another.</ab>

<ab>Therefore reheat your <tl>molds</tl> alone, not making fire there,
except to cover it.</ab>

<ab>And because your <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> become sour when
frequently melted red, to soften,<comment rid="c_015r_01"/> melt it without reddening, and
cast in a rod.</ab>

<ab><m>Brick</m> cools the <m>metal</m>, &amp; if this were not for giving

The reheated <tl>molds</tl> cannot withstand several casts. But those in
which one wants to cast only <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>
<corr><del>and</del></corr> <add>or</add> flat medals, having been only
dried, withstand many.</ab>
