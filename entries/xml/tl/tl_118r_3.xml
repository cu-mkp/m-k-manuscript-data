<ab><m>Stones made from water</m> called <m><df><de>stuf</de></df></m>,<comment rid="c_118r_01"/>
<m>charcoal</m>, the <m>compound of tin &amp; fine latten</m>, <m>paper
<tl>pestled</tl></m> &amp; mixed with <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m>, <m>cork</m>,
<m>heated parchment</m>, <m>white coral</m> are appropriate for making <env>grottos</env>. But <m>fantastical pieces of wood</m> which are
found in the <env>forests</env>, &amp; <m><pa>mushrooms</pa></m>, and
<m><pa><fr>potirons</fr></pa> of trees</m>, once dry, are better than
any other because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
<m>looking-glass tin</m>, which has a shiny luster. One finely <tl>pestles</tl> diverse sorts of <m>marcasites</m> which one washes to cleanse them of
<m>earth</m>, &amp; one sprinkles the work with it, which is very
beautiful. If there is no fountain in the <env>grotto</env>, one
<m>glues</m> all <del><fr>al</fr></del> of this with <m>strong glue</m>, 
<del>which</del> and it is soon done. <add>Take
specimens of all kinds of <m>minerals</m>. The <m>sulfurous marcasites</m>,
which do not have a grain but are uniform like <m>looking-glass tin</m>,
are very beautiful.</add></ab>

<m>Rosette</m> is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
lumps which are pulverized under the <tl>hammer</tl>, which are very
beautiful pulverized on <env>grottos</env>.</ab>
