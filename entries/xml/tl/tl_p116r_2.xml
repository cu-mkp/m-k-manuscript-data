<head>Molding <del>with</del> <fr>en noyau</fr>, with the same
<m>sand</m>, <m>wax</m> images, or <m>lead</m> medals and suchlike</head>

<ab>Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with <m>wax</m>
what does not, and then anoint your images of <m>wax</m> or of
<m>lead</m> with <m><pa>olive</pa> oil</m>, very thinly &amp; very
lightly, such that the <m>oil</m> makes no thickness nor body on the
medal. Then, heat a little <m>eau-de-vie</m>,
<del>until</del> &amp; when it is lukewarm, moisten the <m>oiled</m>
medal with it, for if <del>it is</del> the <m>water</m> were cold, it
would reject the <m>oil</m>, it would not sit well on it. Next, cast your <m>sand
of <m>plaster</m>, <del><fr>bri</fr></del> <m>brick</m>, &amp;
<m>wet alum</m></m> on top, having arranged your image on the <m>clay</m>
<mu>mandore</mu> &amp; having made a circle around it
<del><fr>de</fr></del> to give it the necessary thickness. These medals
are <m>oiled</m> and rubbed thus with <add><m>eau-de-vie</m></add>
because they are firm &amp; hard &amp; would not be malleable for taking
out of the<del><fr>e</fr></del><comment rid="c_116r_02"/> <del>the</del> <tl>mold</tl>, which is
tenacious, as are natural animals, which are soft &amp;
flexible.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">

When you have tempered your <m>sand</m>, do not cast it in the middle of the
<tl>mold</tl> but on the sides, so that the <m>sand</m> descends gently and
that the beginning is thin &amp; afterward thick. If your <m>tempered sand</m>
sounds like <m>water</m> falling in the <tl>mold</tl>, it is a sign that
is too thin. Make it, therefore, of medium thickness.
