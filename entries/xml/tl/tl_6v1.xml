<ab render="wide">You can embellish them with <tl><m>enamel cannules</m></tl> of
various colors by covering the <m>latten or iron wire</m> with the said
<tl>cannules</tl>. These you will break neatly to the length that you
want if you slightly notch with a <tl>cutting file</tl> the place to
be broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend
<add>them</add> with a <tl><m>wood</m> model</tl> over a
<tl>chafing-dish</tl> or else by the heat of the <tl>lamp</tl>. It can
also be drawn as long as you want in a <tl>small furnace</tl> made like
a <tl>reverberatory furnace</tl> but which is pierced on both sides. And
when the large <tl>cannule</tl> is red, they seize the hot end using
<tl>small pincers with a long beak</tl>, such that one prong of the beak
of the <tl>small pincers</tl> enters inside the end of the 
<tl>cannule</tl>, &amp; thus it is lengthened without becoming stopped, &amp;
the other end of the <tl>cannule</tl> is held with the <bp>hand</bp>,
because it is not hot. When the <tl>cannule</tl> is stretched enough,
the one who works seated, having his <tl>furnace</tl>
the <ms>size of a <pa>carnation</pa> pot</ms> before him,
breaks it off &amp; continues. This is for making 
<tl>cannules</tl> for capes, which are cut, as said, with a
<tl>file</tl>. <pro>Glass button makers</pro> also avail themselves of
the said <tl>furnace</tl>.</ab>
