<head><m>Azure</m></head>

<ab><m>Azure</m> is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel
<del>without</del> with <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> with which it has
been first thinned, without putting in <m><pa>spike lavender</pa>
oil</m>. And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will
not shine, thus appearing to be well-imbibed. If not, it will shine.</ab>

<ab><m><fr>Azur d'esmail</fr></m> <del>imbibed in <m>oil</m></del> tempered
in <m>oil</m>, leaves it &amp; returns to its primary nature if you mix it
in <m>water</m>.</ab>

<ab>Colors for working in miniature want to be thoroughly ground, &amp;
work them with a point of a <tl>paintbrush</tl> if you want your
work to be well-softened.</ab>
