 Arranging various animals

  When you uncover some
  <al>
   female lizards
  </al>
  entwined while biting each
other,
  <del>
   &amp;
  </del>
  which is the most difficult thing to mold
because of the number of feet &amp; because of the tip of their tails,
which are very fine,

   One

  <del>
   <fr>
    trou

  </del>
  be uncovered that remains as if
suspended in mid air to steady it, in order that the second cast, which
you will do on top for the second half, will not vary. And to steady it
over the void, take a little
  <m>
   wax

  it, 
&amp; lengthen it on a
  <tl>
   table
  </tl>
  into the form of a
  <tl>
   thick needle
  </tl>
  , 
then cut that which you will need, &amp; with the
  <tl>
   tip of a hot
   <m>
    iron wire
   </m>
  </tl>
  , 
join it where it will be necessary. Steady also on the

    mold

  all that will
have detached from it (when you uncover the half of the belly) with
some
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  , taken lightly with the
  <tl>
   point of a penknife
  </tl>
  ,
&amp; joined &amp; melted with the
  <tl>
   <m>
    iron wire

  . And when
you make your gate, you ought only to bring the wax to the place &amp;
to the edge of the
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  which, being joined to the animal &amp;
melting, will continue the gate up to the animal without spoiling
anything, which is a secret.
