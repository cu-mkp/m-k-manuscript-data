especially for

recognize that they are dry enough when, after having brought the inside

  the other is scaly on the inside, as it
demonstrates on the outside. Thus, one does not use this for delicate
things that are molded on two sides. One smooths &amp; flattens these
two halves on some

   smooth

    wood

  <m>

prepared &amp; rounded on the sides, and having set the medal on top,
one tightens and presses it quite strongly.

  And to cut it well, always begin coming from the
softest part to the scales. And if your medal does not come out by
itself, scratch the
  <tl>
   <m>
    bone
   </m>
  </tl>
  from the back, which is rugged,
and it will release. When you want to cast, secure &amp; join your two
  <tl>
   <m>
    bones
   </m>
  </tl>
  with some
  <tl>
   small points of
   <m>
    wood

&amp;c. But to mold very neatly, there is only our
