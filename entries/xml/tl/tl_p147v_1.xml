<ab>I have cast with it the cleanest I have seen, in very small
figures &amp; thin as <m>paper</m>. I have cast very hot in the
very red <tl>mold</tl>, and have put in the melted substance of
<del>this</del> <add>the</add> two <del>substances</del> compositions,
which make <m>silver</m> run, &amp; have made as if I had wanted to
cast <m>pure silver</m>. This alloy is white in
<tl><fr>bullitoire</fr></tl>, like any alloys which resemble, however
little, <m>☾</m>. For casting something delicate, use
this one.</ab>
