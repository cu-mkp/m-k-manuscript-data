<head>Congealing <m>mercury</m></head>

<ab>It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two
<ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> in a rather large <tl><m>iron</m> pot</tl>,
putting in, for an <ms>&#8485;</ms> of
<m>&#9791;</m>, ii <ms>&#8485;</ms> of
<m>verdet</m> <del>of</del> and <m>vitriol of
saltpeter</m> <ms><la>ana</la></ms>,<comment rid="c_083r_03"/> with sufficient quantity of <m>old
water from <pro>farriers</pro></m>.</ab>

<ab>Or else, melt 4 <ms>&#8485;</ms> of <m>tin</m>, &amp; as
it cools, purify it of its <m>filth</m>, which is on top, then, make a
hole in it &amp; put in this i <ms>&#8485;</ms> of
<m>&#9791;</m> &amp; it will come out like <m>tin</m> if you
remelt it, but it will be breakable. And if you want to assay if it is
<m>tin</m> or <m>&#9791;</m>, redden a <tl>shovel</tl> &amp;
put a small piece of your ingot on top. If it is <m>tin</m>, it will melt
&amp; stay, but if it is <m>&#9791;</m>, will quickly melt,
then, crackling quite strongly, it will take flight. One ought to congeal it in
a <tl>spoon</tl> or in a <tl>hollow crucible</tl> &amp; make a
moderately sized hole.</ab>

<ab>It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in <m>aquafortis</m> which beforehand will have eaten a little <m>silver</m>.
This one, mixed, makes <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>lead</m> run.</ab>
