<head>Colors in <m>oil</m> that are imbibed</head>
        
<ab>It is best that colors in <m>oil</m> are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
<m>oil</m> has remained in that part, which would make the colors die.
The <m>varnish</m> mends all this &amp; unites &amp; renders it similar
in one place as in another. <mark>|</mark> It is necessary that gold color be laid down thick, for if it were clear, it
would be imbibed &amp; would run.</ab>
