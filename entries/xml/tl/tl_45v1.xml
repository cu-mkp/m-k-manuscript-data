<head>Loading an <wp>arquebus</wp></head>

<ab>You ought to have different charges according to the range that you
want to give to your <wp>arquebus</wp>, all of which should have a <tl>screw</tl>
on the end that fits in the <tl>nut</tl> of the <tl>ramrod</tl> of the
said <wp>arquebus</wp>. Thus, when you have put the <m>powder</m> in the charge,
which is in the <tl>nut</tl>, hold the <tl>ramrod</tl> upright. And
raising your <wp>arquebus</wp> up, insert the said <tl>ramrod</tl> until the
charge is at the bottom of the <wp>arquebus</wp>, then right the <wp>arquebus</wp>, the
mouth of the <wp>barrel</wp> up, and remove the <tl>little ramrod</tl>. Thus your
<m>powder</m> will be entirely in the breech without any of its grain or
dust attaching to the sides of the <wp>arquebus</wp>, which always has some <m>filth</m>
in the chamber. Thus it will not push back, and you will shoot more
true.</ab>
