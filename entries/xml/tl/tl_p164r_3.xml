<head><m>Leady silver</m></head>

<ab>

It degrades a lot, because the <m>lead</m> which is mixed in works it
like in the <tl>cupel</tl>, and makes it jump in little balls at the
edges of the <tl>crucible</tl> &amp; on the <m>charcoal</m> which
covers it. It is also fatty, and thus it is good to melt all <m>coined
silver</m>, like <cn>reals</cn> &amp; others, &amp; to put it in ingots
before melting it for casting <al>lizards</al> &amp; animals, for it
comes out better. I molded some as neat as the principal,<comment rid="c_137r_03"/> such as a
<al>little viper</al> of <m>silver</m>, and I made the alloy out of 4
<m><ms><cn>reals</cn></ms></m>, of 20 <m><ms><cn>sous from
<pl>Spain</pl></cn></ms></m>, &amp; a coin of xx
<m><ms><cn>sous from <pl>France</pl></cn></ms></m>.</ab>
