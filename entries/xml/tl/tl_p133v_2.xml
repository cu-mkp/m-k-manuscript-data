<head>Thing that does not release</head>

One needs to cut it to make it burn in the <tl>mold</tl>, but cut it
with <tl>chisels</tl> in one go, in order that the <m>blood</m> does
not fall on the <tl>mold</tl> &amp; does not create <m>filth</m>, which,
once reheated, is difficult to remove. Next, put your <tl>mold</tl> in
the <tl>oven</tl> or similar heat, in order that it dries promptly &amp;
retracts before making a crust or <m>mold</m> on the
<tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

When you mold <al>small female lizards</al> and you want to uncover the part
first molded, begin to uncover the heads &amp; you will recognize its
place by the <tl>pin</tl>. Do not attempt to uncover the legs until you
have uncovered the rest of the body, in order that the stripped body, as
it moves, does not remove the legs from their place, where it is
vexing to put them back. When you remove the <tl>little points</tl> which
hold the legs, fix them &amp; press them with something, in order that,
when removing the <tl>pin</tl>, they are not removed from their place,
or, in the end, you can put them back with some <m>wax</m>.</ab>
