 Animals dried in the
 <tl>
  oven
 </tl>
 for
 <tmp>
  a long
time
 </tmp>
 <ab>
  Plant them on a
  <tl>
   slab of
   <m>
    earth
   </m>
  </tl>
  , arranging them with
  <tl>
   points of
   <m>
    iron
   </m>
   wire
  </tl>
  , as if you wanted to mold them, and
  <del>
   they
  </del>
  dry them in an
  <tl>
   oven
  </tl>
  <ms>
   after the
   <m>
    bread
   </m>
   has been taken out
  </ms>
  . And they always remain thus, as much for
  <al>
   snakes
  </al>
  , as
  <al>
   birds
  </al>
  and other things. But it is
necessary that they be dried promptly.

  Note that one needs to give them their shape &amp; put them in the
  <m>
   sand
  </m>
  ,
as with flowers, &amp; promptly dry them in the
  <tl>
   oven
  </tl>
  , which is
  <ms>
   hot enough, like when one takes out the
   <m>
    bread
   </m>
  </ms>
  . And it
should stay there
  <ms>
   <tmp>
    a day &amp; a night
   </tmp>
  </ms>
  in order that
it is
  <del>
   <fr>
    chau
   </fr>
  </del>
  dry, for otherwise it would be
  <sn>
   smelly
  </sn>
  . However, take heed that the
  <tl>
   oven
  </tl>
  not be too
harsh, but rather
  <ms>
   like the heat of the
   <env>
    sun in
    <tmp>
     June
    </tmp>
   </env>
  </ms>
  , otherwise the animals cook. Once dry, do not
wet them, but clean them with a
  <tl>
   paintbrush
  </tl>
  or clean them
with a
  <tl>
   brush
  </tl>
  .
