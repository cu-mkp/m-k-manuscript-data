It is the most beautiful <al>snake</al> that can be molded, because it
has very beautiful scales, &amp; hard &amp; transparent. Its true color
is made with good <m>verdigris</m> ground well with some <m>good
vinegar</m>, if it is of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. And if it is in some
place darker, fumigate this first color with <m>sulfur</m>, as you
know. And if one needs to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub
with <tl><m>coarse linen</m></tl>. <add>The male ejects from its

firmly pressed, a little mass like <ms>half an <wp>arquebus</wp> ball</ms>
made in the genitals and full of very venomous<comment rid="c_129r_02"/> spurs.</add></ab>
