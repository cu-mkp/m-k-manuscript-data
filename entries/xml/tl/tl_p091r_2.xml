<ab>since the two <tl><m>bones</m></tl> are joined,
<del><fr>co</fr></del> cut them evenly all around, &amp; make notches
<del><fr>e</fr></del> around it in different places which cross over the
join of the two <tl><m>bones</m></tl>, in order to recognize well the
place of the first join. Or else, with little <tl>shards of
<m>wood</m></tl>, pierce them, or <del><fr>ma</fr></del> coat the
joins with some <m>clay</m>, &amp; dry. Press, <del>between them</del>
your <tl><bp>hands</bp> joined between your<bp> two </bp>knees</tl>
&amp; not with a <tl>press</tl>, because the <tl><m>bones</m></tl> would
crack. Mold also at your leisure &amp; two or three times, until you see
that it is pressed quite tightly together &amp; well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, pounce with some
<m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with <m>oil</m> &amp; with <m><pa>willow</pa>
charcoal powder</m> &amp; with a <tl>brush</tl>, to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not too greasy or <m>oily</m> when you mold in
<tl><m><al>cuttlefish</al> bone</m></tl>. When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some <tl><m>bone</m></tl>. And cast moderately hot,
which you will know when the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> is about to change
its <del>good</del> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it turns
the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> very red. The <ms>proportion</ms> of <m>lead</m>
&amp; <m>tin</m> is as much of one as of the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out &amp; of several pieces, make the gate forked with three or
four grooves, <del>and</del> <del>make</del> &amp; direct these grooves to the
place of the thicker parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like straight on the heads, for this attracts the <m>metal</m> &amp; feeds
the figure better. Shake your <tl>frame</tl> a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <m>Tin</m> that is too
hot <del><fr>p</fr></del>burns<comment rid="c_091v_01"/> the <tl><m>bone</m></tl>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out <del>from the <fr>mo</fr></del> hot from the <tl>mold</tl>, it risks
breaking.<lb/>
