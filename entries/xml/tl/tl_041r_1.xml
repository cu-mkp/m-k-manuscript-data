<head><m>Earth for casting, for <pro>founders</pro></m></head>

<ab>It renders itself fatty once beaten and also mixed with
<m><al>horse</al> dung</m>. <m><pro>Potter</pro>â€™s earth</m> would be
too fatty and would crack &amp; would not hold in the fire, but one needs
to mix it with <ms>half as much</ms> <m>sand</m> and a <ms>quarter</ms>
or a <ms>fifth</ms> of <m><add><al>horse</al></add> dung</m>. And leave
it to dry, then turn it to powder, then <tl>sift</tl> it to render it fine &amp;
purged of gravel, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The <m>dung</m>
renders the <m>earth</m> more amenable &amp; easier to deal with, but it
is necessary that it be well free of <m>straw</m> &amp; other things.
And when the <m>earth</m> is very fatty, one needs to give it more <m>sand</m>
&amp; more <m>dung</m>.<comment rid="c_032v_01"/> But one does find <m>fatty earths</m>,
in and of themselves mixed with <m>sand</m>. If they are not, do it by artifice.
One always needs to reheat the <m>earths</m> before casting.</ab></div>
