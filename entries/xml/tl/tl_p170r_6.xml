  &amp; join &amp;

   solder
  </m>
  a tail of
  <m>
   latten wire
  </m>
  with
  <m>
   solder

  . The lumps on a flower are a small matter, for this can
be removed with the
  <tl>
   <fr>
    chaple

  , but let the leaves come
out well, then the

 Cleaning closed
 <tl>
  molds
 </tl>
 <ab>
  One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for when hot, they retain the
  <m>
   ash
  </m>
  . When cold, they are cleaned better. Take a
  <tl>
   <m>
    thin wire of latten
   </m>
  </tl>
  or a
  <tl>
   <m>
    delicate straw
   </m>
  </tl>
  to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the gate. Blow into it &amp; suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
thicken the tail with
  <m>
   wax
  </m>
  , then cut it,
