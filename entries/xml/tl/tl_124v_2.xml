<head>Casting in <m>gold</m></head>

<ab><tl>Molds</tl> are reheated better &amp; more surely in a closed
fire, such as <del><tl>pot</tl></del> in a <tl>reverberatory
furnace</tl>. So that when <pro>goldsmiths</pro> want to cast some
important piece <del>of <m>gold</m> <fr>e</fr></del> that has cost a lot to model in
<m>wax</m>, they put the <tl>molds</tl> in a <tl>pot</tl> &amp; cover
them, &amp; fill the <tl>pot</tl> with <m>earth</m>, sustaining the fire
that holds them together &amp; tight. Then, they reheat the
<tl>mold</tl>, <m>earth</m> &amp; <tl>pot</tl> together, and when
everything is quite red, they cast the <m>gold</m>. <m>Fine gold</m> does
not run well, but <m>alloyed gold</m> does.</ab>

<ab margin="left-top" render="wide">
<m>Gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> do not sour,<lb/>
being entirely red and hot, quenched<lb/>

<ab margin="left-middle">


<m>Gold</m> is a <ms>quarter heavier than</ms> <m>lead</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


When <m>gold</m> reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
<m>emerald</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


Take care that in the place where you want to cast the <m>gold</m>, no
<m>lead</m>, <m>tin</m>, or <m>lime</m> of these has fallen in the
<tl>forge</tl>.<lb/>
