 For layering

  Common
  <pro>
   painters
  </pro>
  &amp;
  <pro>
   scribes
  </pro>
  make
  <m>
   <fr>
    batture
   </fr>
  </m>
  , that is
  <m>
   <pro>
    joiner
   </pro>
   â€™s glue
  </m>
  tempered with
  <m>
   water
  </m>
  on the fire, moderately clear, mixed with very little
  <m>
   honey
  </m>
  , that is to say a few
  <ms>
   drops
  </ms>
  to make it stick. And
with it they form letters, or that which they want to
  <m>
   gild
  </m>
  ,
with a
  <tl>
   paintbrush
  </tl>
  , and immediately after layer the
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  , but they never do their work quite neatly, and if there is
a lot of
  <m>
   honey
  </m>
  it dries only with great difficulty. This layer is
undone
  <env>
   in the rain
  </env>
  .

 <ab>
  Others do better, they temper
  <m>
   candy sugar
  </m>
  in
  <m>
   water
  </m>
  and
mix it with
  <m>
   sanguine
  </m>
  that they call
  <m>
   <df>
    <fr>
     cocon
    </fr>
   </df>
  </m>
  , thoroughly ground, adding in a little
  <m>
   soap
  </m>
  . This is done neatly, &amp; renders
  <m>
   gold
  </m>
  beautiful if
one uses it as the seat.
