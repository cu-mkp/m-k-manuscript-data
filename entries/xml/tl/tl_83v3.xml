for fear that some <m>charcoal</m> might <del>you</del> enter it, put
them almost under the <tl>grate</tl>. It is good that your
<tl><fr>four Ã  vent</fr></tl> be in an <env>aerated place</env> so that the
<env>wind</env> might make it heat better, &amp; that it be well dry,

&amp; that there is only the entry of the <tl>blast-pipe</tl> of the
<tl>bellows</tl>. And by the end, you need to give it force,
as at the beginning you will blow gently.</ab>
