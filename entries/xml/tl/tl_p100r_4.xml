<ab>

Being melted with <m>pebbles</m>, it makes the <m>glass</m> very white.
But before, one needs to calcine it on a <tl>hot tile or shovel</tl>. And that which will remain from the vapor, mix it with <ms>as
much of the <m>white calcined pebbles</m></ms>. It is true that, in the
<tl>little furnace</tl>, it does not clarify well. But for <m>large panes of
glass</m>, it makes the <m>glass</m> very clear &amp; white &amp;
clean.</ab>
