 Lights
 <ab>
  Your
  <tl>
   paintbrush
  </tl>
  shows it to you by casting a shadow
which must always follow the
  <bp>
   back of your hand
  </bp>

  .
It is necessary that the panel not be facing the
  <env>
   light
  </env>
  head-on, but half turned

the shadow &amp; the work, as a harsh light a harsh
work.
