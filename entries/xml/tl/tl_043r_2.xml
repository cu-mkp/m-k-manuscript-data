<head>White bronzing on <m>plaster</m></head>

<ab>One needs to give four layers of <m><pro>painters</pro>â€™ distemper glue</m>
on the <m>plaster</m> portrait, always leaving each layer to
dry. Next, with <m>minium from <pl>England</pl> </m> ground on marble, or
burnt <m>lead</m>, grind <del>av</del> &amp; temper with a bit of
<m>gum</m> or <del><fr>go</fr></del> <m>glue</m>, &amp; coat lightly. Once
dry, rub lightly with a little <m>cotton</m> and the <m>plaster</m>
portrait will seem to be of <m>lead</m>. Others grind <m>minium</m> with
<m>quicksilver</m>.</ab>
