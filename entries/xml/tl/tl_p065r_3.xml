  When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a
  <tl>
   <m>
    <fr>
     cristallin
    </fr>
   </m>
   mirror
  </tl>
  , which represents
nature well, and in which
  <del>
   it
  </del>
  you will see if your
shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a
  <tl>
   candle
  </tl>
  , for
  <env>
   firelight
  </env>
  will make the shadows reddish.
The
  <pro>
   painter
  </pro>
  also teaches himself with the
  <tl>
   mirror
  </tl>
  ,
for he sees in it what nature can do.
