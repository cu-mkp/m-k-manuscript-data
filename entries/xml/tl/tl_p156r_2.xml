<head>Very light and hollow work of <m>gold</m></head>

<ab>Cast a <al>lizard</al> or any medal you like in <m>base silver</m>,
like <cn>billon</cn>. Next, <m>gild</m> it lightly. And once the first
<m>gilding</m> is done &amp; dried by fire, brighten, rub with a
<tl>scratch-brush</tl>, &amp; make another layer of light <m>gilding</m>
like the first time, &amp; do thus three or four times or more,
according to the thickness you want to give. And then, having made a
small hole in the least visible place, put your work into <m>good
aquafortis</m>, which penetrating to the <m>silver</m> through the hole
will eat it all away without damaging the <m>gold</m>, so that you will
have a <al>lizard</al> hollow to its nails, or any other work, so light
that by blowing you will agitate it. But take heed not to make the layer
of <m>amalgamated gold</m> all at once, or<comment rid="c_156r_01"/> of hardly any thickness each
time, because that would block the small features, but proceeding
therein as said, lightly &amp; several times, <add>and cleaning
well</add>, you will do well.</ab>

In order for the <m>aquafortis</m> to eat away better, it is necessary
to <del>cast</del> cast in <m>base silver</m>.</ab>
