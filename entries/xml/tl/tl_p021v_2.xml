<head>Defense of a town</head>

<ab>There is nothing that has a greater effect for the defense of a
breach than <wp>petards</wp><comment rid="c_008r_04"/> placed at the entryway at the time of the assault.
They carry a lot of ammunition. <del><fr>be</fr></del> One fills them
with <m>cart nails</m>, <m>large steel dice</m>, <m>bits of chain</m>
&amp; similar things. And when one senses that the enemies are close,
one sets fire to all. <wp>Grenades</wp>, too, well-made and aptly thrown, cause
great damage. And to make them worse, one puts <m>coarsely
<del><tl>pestling</tl></del> <tl>pestled</tl> glass</m> either in the <tl>molds</tl> or in the
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, when one wants to cast them; this worsens the <md>wounds</md>.
The <wp>grenades</wp> ought not to be too brittle. But it is good that they be
somewhat alloyed with the <m>substance of the pieces</m> in order that,
holding the blast a little rather than breaking, they have more
violence.</ab></div>
