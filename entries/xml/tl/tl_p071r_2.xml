 <ab>
  The
  <m>
   <pa>
    elm
   </pa>
  </m>
  , in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks
diversified with grey and black, and the
  <m>
   root of the
   <pa>
    maple
   </pa>
  </m>
  , but one needs to choose well the grain of the
  <m>
   wood
  </m>
  . One gives the
  <m>
   <pa>
    maple
   </pa>
  </m>
  a certain yellow color,
then one varnishes it.
