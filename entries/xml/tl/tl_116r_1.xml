<ab> One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they
<del><fr>ont</fr></del><comment rid="c_116r_05"/> wilt &amp; dry out. Dip them, therefore,
immediately in good <m>eau-de-vie</m> &amp; then put them in your
<tl>tempered <m>sand</m> mold</tl>, like <al>snakes</al>. For which one needs no
release, for while the <tl>molds</tl> are being 
reheated <del><fr>s</fr></del><comment rid="c_116r_01"/> <corr><del><fr>s</fr></del></corr>, the plant burns, which does not happen with
animals that have bones <del>&amp; <fr>q</fr></del>. It is necessary
that for bouquets, the <m>sand</m> be not as thick as for <al>snakes</al>
because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.
