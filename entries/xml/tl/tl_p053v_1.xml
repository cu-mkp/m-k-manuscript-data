<ab>They are produced from seed, that is to say eggs, that which is sold
by the <ms>ounce</ms>, which is commonly sold in <pl>Languedoc</pl> iii
<ms>lb</ms> v <cn>s</cn>. The one from <pl>Spain</pl> that
<pro>merchants</pro> bring there is considered the best because the
<al>worms</al> which come from there are not so subject to illnesses
&amp; make more <m>silk</m>. In <pl>Spain</pl>, from one <ms>ounce</ms> of
<del><m>silk</m></del> seed, <al>worms</al> are produced from it which
commonly yield <del><fr>ord</fr></del> xv <ms>lb</ms> of <m>silk</m>.
But <del>the <ms>ounce</ms></del> from one <ms>ounce</ms> of seed
produced in <pl>France</pl>, only x or xii come out of it. Three
<ms>ounces</ms> of seed are for producing such a quantity of
<al>worms</al>, that with them you will be able to furnish a <env>room
accomodated with three or 4 levels of large shelves</env>. Willingly
they begin to molt <tmp>around Holy Week</tmp>. And to do
this, one puts them in a <tl><pa>fir</pa> box</tl>, like those where one
puts sweetmeats, warmly among <tl>feather cushions</tl>. And at the
beginning, they molt like <del><fr>f</fr></del> little
<al>black ants</al>, &amp; as soon as there are two or three molted,
one needs to give them <m><pa>white mulberry</pa> leaves</m>.</ab>

And then
arrange them on the <tl>shelves</tl>. And three <ms>times <tmp>per
day</tmp></ms>, one needs to exchange <m>fresh leaves</m>. And if
<tmp>during the day</tmp> there is some <env>thunder <add>or rainy
weather, cloud-covered &amp; cool</add></env>, one needs to keep in the
<env>room</env> three or 4 <tl>chafing dishes <del>&amp;</del> with
glowing charcoal</tl>, &amp; put in <m>incense</m> until all the
<env>room</env> would be filled with <m>smoke</m>. And when the
<env>weather is warm &amp; <fr>serain</fr></env>, the <m>silk</m> abounds
more &amp; is all the better for it. Some <al>worms</al> make it whiter,
others more yellowish. And even if it may be white, it yellows when one
draws it with <m>hot water</m>. <del>From</del>
The <al>worms</al>, <tmp>from their birth until <add><fr>u</fr></add> the <del>their</del>
time when they make their cocoons &amp; their prisons</tmp>, sleep &amp;
rest 4 times, &amp; each time remain 4 or five <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>
resting without eating, as if they were dying to be reborn again,
for each time they change skin &amp; begin by molting from the head then
consequently, on different <tmp>days</tmp>, the <del><fr>s</fr></del>
rest of the body, &amp; from white turn grayish, &amp; from grayish to
white. <del>Finally</del> And if one of them has some illness
who does not have the strength to molt, one needs to help it &amp;
be careful not to break it, for at that time rendering a yellow liquor, it is
no longer worth anything. And further they scarcely profit after one has
handled it with the <tl><bp>hand</bp></tl>. <tmp>Around Pentecost</tmp>,
they begin to want to climb on the dry branches of <pa>heath</pa> or
<pa>heather</pa> that one prepares for them <del><fr>en</fr></del> &amp;

<ab>on some of the <tl>high shelves</tl>, &amp; at that time, one knows
when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they
<del><fr>hau</fr></del> lengthen &amp; raise the head &amp; a part of
the body. At that time one carries them to the <pa>heath</pa> branches
where they stop &amp; begin to spin their prison, which one calls
cocoon, commonly the <ms>size of a <al>pigeon</al> egg</ms>, although
one finds much larger ones because it sometimes happens that two or
three &amp; up to xi <al>worms</al> are put in a cocoon, which is hairy
&amp; downy all around, <del>&amp;</del> the hair of which is
<m>ferret-silk</m> or <m>floret</m>; &amp; from the
cocoon, which is a white, solid, continuous &amp; firm skin, <m>silk</m>
is made. The cocoon is so hard that one only cuts it with difficulty
with a <tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl>. And nevertheless, to leave its
prison, <del>it</del> the <al>worm</al> gnaws it at one end,
&amp; after <add>having</add> stayed inside living on its own sap
<del>it</del> for three <ms><tmp>weeks</tmp></ms>, it comes
out, diminished <ms>by half</ms>. For when it begins to spin, it is
<ms>as long as a <bp>ring finger</bp></ms> &amp; has eight feet, &amp;
coming out it is <ms>shorter by half</ms> &amp; only has 4 feet. On the
other hand, it has become a <al>butterfly</al> &amp; has wings, without, however,
flying. And there are male &amp; female. As soon as they come
out of the cocoon, the male charges the female &amp; one puts them on a
<tl>white linen</tl>, where they make their eggs, which the female would not
make well &amp; profitably if the male was not given to her. And when the
male has detached himself from a female, one needs to throw it out, for it
would not be good to give it to another. They have completed spinning
&amp; making their eggs in three <ms><tmp>weeks</tmp></ms> &amp;
<tmp>around <pn>St. John</pn>&#8217;s Day</tmp>.<comment rid="c_052v_01"/> And at that time one keeps
their eggs &amp; seed <ms><tmp>until Holy Week</tmp></ms>, as
<del><fr>on</fr></del> is said. Some spin among the leaves &amp; make
their cocoon there without climbing high.</ab>
