<ab>It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it
must be in one piece &amp; as if taken from a <env>quarry</env> or
<env>rock formation</env>, &amp; the deeper one takes it from, the
better. The signs of its goodness are that it is thus amassed, and that
when removing itself in the form of <m>rock</m>, it comes out in lumps &amp;
<del><fr>qu</fr></del> bricks, which demonstrate its bond &amp; that it
is not too lean.</ab>

<ab>However, it should <sn>break apart between your
<tl><bp>hands</bp></tl></sn> &amp; have very small
<del><fr>men</fr></del> &amp; delicate grains &amp; of the same nature.
If it is not delicate enough, you can pass &amp; grind it finely, either
through <m>water</m> or through a <tl>sieve</tl> <del>&amp; when
it</del> or on the <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, &amp; in this way, from
<del><fr>sil</fr></del> lean they become fatty &amp; well bound. You
can mold with it in <del><fr>sa</fr></del> <tl>frame</tl> or
<fr>en noyau</fr> without <m>cloth waste</m>, &amp; try it with
<m>lead</m>, for if with this it does not become porous &amp; casts
neatly, it will also behave well with <m>copper</m>. Some say that the
<m>fatty sands</m> do not want the <m>metal</m> to be cast too hot.
<pro>Artisans who work in large works</pro> &amp;, who for profit, do not
need to grind &amp; seek the curiosities of <m>artificial sands</m>,
benefit more from seeking some that is ready-made by <env>nature</env>, which has the
finest grain possible, &amp; for small works, they only pass it
through a <tl>sieve</tl>. But those who work in small works, finely
grind it &amp; grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of
it.</ab>

<ab margin="left-top">

<m><pa><fr>Orber√©</fr> grain</pa></m> makes a tawny powder, very
delicate &amp; very soft, which, once mixed, could <del>mix</del> mold
very neatly. <emph>Try</emph> <m><pa>wheat</pa> flour</m> burned over a closed
fire.</ab>
