<ab><al>Calandra larks</al> &amp; all
<al>birds</al> taken from the nest &amp; which have not had freedom are
better, for these which are taken by net never sing so well. However,
the wild ones give <del><ill/></del> much pleasure with their
chanting, but they ought be taken <tmp>before <pn>St. Michael</pn></tmp>,<comment rid="c_049v_09"/>
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call <df><fr>gaillardise</fr></df>,<comment rid="c_049v_06"/>
which makes them sick &amp; sometimes makes them die, especially
<al>calandra larks</al>. One knows this when they are sad &amp; do not sing.
One must pierce it <del><fr>av</fr></del>, not with a <tl>pin</tl>,<comment rid="c_049r_04"/> but
very gently by turning with the tip of <tl>quite pointy feather</tl>.
The <al>calandra lark</al> does not want to be without <del>grey</del>
<m>river sand</m>, &amp; the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself in it
&amp; purges itself with it.
