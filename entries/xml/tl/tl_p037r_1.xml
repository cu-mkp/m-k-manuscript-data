  whitens the more it is melted, because the
  <m>
   tin
  </m>
  does not go away but rather mixes in more. And, by holding it
a
  <tmp>
   long time
  </tmp>
  in the fire, the
  <m>
   filth
  </m>
  is eaten away, which is what 
makes it brittle. If you want to chase the
  <m>
   tin
  </m>
  from the
  <m>
   copper
  </m>
  , after it is quite hot, throw in
  <m>
   saltpeter
  </m>
  often.
This only &amp; not the fire separates it, &amp; purifies it, &amp; eats
the
  <m>
   filth
  </m>
  . The
  <m>
   <fr>
    metal
   </fr>
  </m>
  is cast very neatly. The
  <m>
   copper
  </m>
  is prone to swell, but because it is soft, it can be fixed
with a
  <tl>
   hammer
  </tl>
  .
