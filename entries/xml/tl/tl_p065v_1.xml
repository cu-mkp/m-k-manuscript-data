<head>Semi-lively colors</head>

<ab>When colors <del><fr>a</fr></del><comment rid="c_065v_05"/> absorb into the <m>canvas</m>, it
means that it has been given imprimatura only once, &amp; for this reason they
become matte rather than <add>being</add> shiny. But this is the best,
as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having
more body, do not die &amp; are all the more beautiful for it,
especially <m>azure</m>, <m>lake</m>, &amp; those do not have body. But
those who want to rush their painting apply imprimatura twice on the first go, to be
done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as
long. The second layer of these does not absorb &amp; remains
shiny.</ab>
