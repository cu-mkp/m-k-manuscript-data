Scarlets

Because one aulne costs seven or eight
lb. to dye, they use cloths worth seven or eight
francs an aulne. But whoever wants something
beautiful se la should buy white cloth worth
fifteen francs an aulne & have it dyed with
pure scarlet pastel & a little cochineal.
Black cloth comes thin because the dyeing is
inexpensive.
