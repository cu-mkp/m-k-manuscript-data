Bellows furnace

Before you put in the metal, it is necessary that it be red
at the bottom, like like a charcoal & well inflamed. Next,
you  fill it & cover the charcoal &
adjust the bellows, otherwise the metal on top would
melt as a result of the bellows & its bottom would be
curdled & cooled & would not run. But if you proceed in this
manner you will melt everything you like.
