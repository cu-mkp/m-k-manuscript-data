Making copper and latten run

Put in at the end, when it is very hot & when you want to cast,
sal ammoniac & saltpeter, which removes filth
& heats it. Mix some ardides with the latten.
@ Guard against the metal touching the iron or the
latten of the box mold, but cover it with sand or
lute. Make the cast very even.
