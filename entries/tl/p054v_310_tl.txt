To dry preserves take a which are not liquid, take an
open tub pierced on both sides with a small, square window,
& pass sticks through these on one side and the other,
& place on these a sieve made of strings in the form of a
net. And on this, you will readily place the vessels with your
preserves. And having put at the bottom of the tub a
chafing-dish or two, cover the tub with a
sheet folded double.
