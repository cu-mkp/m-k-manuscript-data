Birds

Calandra larks & all
birds taken from the nest & which have not had freedom are
better, for these which are taken by net never sing so well. However,
the savage ones give  much pleasure with their
chanting, but they ought be taken before Michaelmas,
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call gaillardise,
which makes them sick & sometimes makes them die, especially
calandra larks. One knows when they are sad & do not sing.
One must pierce it av, not with a pin, but
very gently by turning with the tip of quite pointy feather.
The calandra lark does not want to be without grey
river sand, & the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself
& cleanses itself with it.
