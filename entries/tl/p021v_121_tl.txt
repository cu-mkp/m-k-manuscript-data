Others place two poles fixed well into
the earth such that one is equally as far from the edge
andof the muzzle of the cannon as the other. And
underneath they place the above-mentioned
ruler. Then when want to shoot at
night, they push their cannon straight towards the above-mentioned
ruler & make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on the
end of the aforesaid ruler. Next, they measure with a
ruler or similar thing cut to measure, from one pole to the
side of the cannon & if it is too close or too far from it, they
adjust it & do thus from the side of the other pole.
