Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks,
&c.

Take linseed oil or more cheaply, walnut
oil, and rid it of grease with garlic &
onions+hog's
fennel some also add bread crusts, which you will
boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Next, put
in one lb of the oil thus boiled a piece of black
pitchthe size of a walnut & a double
handful of grains of wheat , without
removing the garlic & onions and let
it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And
when the pitch is well melted & when the oil has body,
you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your
iron over a low charcoal fire & apply your
varnish with a feather or a brosse.
And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your
varnish is dry.


For excellent black varnish, add two or three paternoster
beads of jet among the rest.


Some consider walnut oil better.


If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least
half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It
is dangerous if the fire catches within, if it goes over the top, and is
hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or an
open space.


In five or six lb of oil, one must put one lb
of galipot, which costs 4 sols, & some
peeled garlic cloves. This varnish in and of
itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.

after sands, in the chapter on furbishers.
