Molding a fly

Large flies can be molded & g made
by casting. But one needs par d to anoint underneath
their wings with wheat oil, which dries quickly and
fortifies them & gives them a little thickness. The same is done to
butterflies, cicadas, grasshoppers, &
similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some
leaf or bouquet. The others are made by hand with a very
thin silver sheet. One ought not to keep them once dead,
because they dry out and their legs break.

Wheat oil is put underneath delicate things to render
them more rigid & firm & to make them hold their natural
position. Because being weak & delicate, the wetted sand, weighing down
their tops, would change their form.
