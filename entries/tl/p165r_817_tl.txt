Repairing snakes and lizards

You could well make some puncheons according to the form of
their scales, & making some bigger & some smaller, according to
the shape of the neck, the body, & the tail. If there is something
broken, you can graft it on with small pieces points of
iron or steel wire, & glue with fish
glue, & then cover it all with gray or black wax. But it
is necessary to let the glue dry for one day
without touching it.
