Iron scales

Once well pulverized & ground on marble &
mixed with the above-mentioned sand of noyau, and dried slowly
without reheating, it endures several casts of lead &
tin. Copper & latten come out well. But if it
is not well ground, like crocum, it goes to the bottom,
if the sand is not wetted thickly enough.
