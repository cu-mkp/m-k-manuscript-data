aforesaid water and let it rest for the space of one & half

put it into another glass vial & soak it very well.

the said first vial, put the rest of the water over this
and do as before when you see that the case is going well, and mix the
first water with the second. By means of this you will be able to
help yourself to this for something more noble.
