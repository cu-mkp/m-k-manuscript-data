Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.



It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper, latten or
similar metal, very neatly, and then when you have molded the
hollow form in the sand, leave the figure of metal that
you have molded in the frame, without moving it
from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a
little & push the figure down in the frame.



It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the
filth & grime accumulate. And, in this way, if you
were mold the face towards the cast, some grime could be found
there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
to repair.

Vinegar is better for moistening than wine. It is
necessary that the frame be quite smooth and even, otherwise
and that the cast be, as you press on one side, the other one
lifts.



This is why the press is better, for it tightens evenly, &
more than your hands, and makes

the coarse sand, which is damp, communicate its humidity to the
soft & fine sand, which is sprinkled & poncé dry
on the medal.



When you mold, always leave your medal in one oftheframes, iswithout stirring
it because, if your hollow form is not molded very neatly, you can put
it back in the right place by means of pegs, which will prevent
it from shifting. But, at first, ponce yout medal with very
fine willow charcoal, & se next
clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release afterwards.

Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the
frame & the sand.
