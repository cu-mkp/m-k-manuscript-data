Casting gold and silver

It is necessary that the sand be from something very dry & arid
& reheated well in the frame, because, if it were humid,
like founder's sand, the gold and silver
would spatter, & cause damage. It is also necessary for the
earth to drink the metal, for cast gold or
silveris becomes very spongy. That is why it must be
beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon
handles.
