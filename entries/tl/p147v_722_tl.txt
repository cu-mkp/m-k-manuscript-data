+Cast of copper alloyed with
☾, which is like very base solder/ ard and old
K and some R out of
xii

I have cast with it the cleanest I have seen, in very small
representations & thin as paper. I have cast very hot in the
very red mold, and have put in the melted substance of
thisthe two substances compositions,
which make silver runny, & have made as if I had wanted to
cast pure silver. This alloy is white in
bullitoire, like any alloys which resemble, however
little, ☾. For casting something delicate, use
this one.
