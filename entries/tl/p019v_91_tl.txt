Mathematical figures without ruler or compass



You know how to draw a circle correctly with the quill & or
else with the nail of your right thumb & the bent
big finger. If you do not have a ruler, fold
paper in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw
a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly without a compass,
fold your paper such that the fold e gives
you a straight line, at the required distance from which, trace
a point & a or a line & saturate it well with
ink. Then fold again the paper & rub it on the back
& it will stamp however much you have made. In that way la
l, A is the line without ink which the paper
fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is
stamped.
