Plaster for casting in wax



When you want to cast in wax in the plaster mold,
you must know as secret that there is need for your mold to be
in hot water. Never does the animal come out so neatly than in
metal, because the wax sticks. But it is to model an
animal as close to the natural et, to then repair
it. One needs to smooth well away all the scales, when for
wax would enter there, & not release well. In molding thus
the animal, flatten down the scales forwax, &, on
the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they stand up, for
animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not wait for the
wax to un peu cool completely to release it,
but do so when it is still a bit warm. When you have also molded the
first cast of the animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its
release, there is as much of it in one half than in the other. Make also
strong wide gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified
when it is released, & after, you cut that off.

+Alabaster, commonly called so, is nevertheless
plaster, is very hard, but it shrinks a lot. It is very good to
make medals, but it wants to be very finely sieved.
