Paper

The whitest & finest is the best. And when the hollow form is quite
clean, as of sulfur or cooked chimolee, it is made
very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of white with a
border of gold to imitate alabaster. And after you have
applied the white, you can burnish it with the tooth.
But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to mix the lead
white with glair of egg & peelings from the fig
tree. Or better, varnish your work with white varnish.
In addition when you are molding with paper, as it starts to dry,
burnish from the back with the tooth.
