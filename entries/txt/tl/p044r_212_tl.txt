They mix viii lbor ten of lead, per
quintal of tin in cities where they are sworn
masters. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One
also uses ii lb of looking glass tin to bind it &
three lb of debris, that is to say the copper shards
that coppersmiths make. This makes the plate more
sonorous and it is not as breakable.


This tin is called common tin.
