Stamped medals from wax

You can mold in wax, mixed with a bit of rosin so it

will be harder &amp; firmer, the relief of whatever you please, either

an animal or a medal, &amp; then, from it, make a hollow form of

latten or copper. Or, hit it mold it

in relief and hammer it in a sheet of tin,

Et pu and then fill with lead &amp; heat it.

Try sheets of gemstone foils molded in a hollow form for lizards,

&amp;c.
