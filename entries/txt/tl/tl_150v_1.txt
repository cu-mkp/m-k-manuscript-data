Molding hollow

This iron wire point, which is put thus

bi through the hole, is to better hold the 

core &amp; keep it from shifting. All of this being

d thus arranged, lay your mold on the

table, the hole at the top, as it is marked here on the side,

&amp; then adapt a circle of soft clay

aultr, two fingers high, around

the hole, like for other molds. And then temper your molding sand

moderately thick, &amp; cast it through the hole until it is well well

filled, up to the surface of the clay circle. But take

heed to not cast r in through the middle of the

hole, but rather from the side, for, since the already made

mold drinks and sucks the moisture of the new, the

new one that you cast in which dries quickly on the edge of

the mold, being quickly dry, s would

obstruct the mold, &amp; it would not finish filling. And when

you cast from the side, if you recognize that it is obstructed, you can

clear a path. Having cast in, blow on the f

the wet gate, &amp; put the

end of your finger in the hole a few times, po

or some small point, to unblock it, &amp; make the hollow

wax fill up. Cast in, at the end, the sand, tempered a little

thick to give strength to the mold, for water coming

to the surface s of the mold

always makes it softer. Having set, scrape off the clay

circle &amp; the excess which is on the hole through which you

cast the noyau, &amp; nothing will be discernable. When your

mold is thus prepared, lute it all around with the

same sand which served for the molds. Next, reheat it in a slow

fire at the beginning, &amp; the mouth of the gate at the bottom, in

order that the wax flows out gently. For if you were

to give it great heat until the wax came out, it would boil

inside &amp; leave some pustules &amp; lumpy things, although

This point is placed in the middle &amp; through the hole of

the gate when the mold is in several pieces, like a

turtle, and this is done in order that the core does

not shake. But when the mold is only of two pieces,

    

it is not necessary to put points in the middle of it.

    

Before casting the core, make some notches all around the hole

through which you want to cast, in order to always better secure the

mold.

Mixed tallow is the reason that, when emptying the wax,

the hole does not become obstructed. One needs half

tallow &amp; half black wax.

All very thick pieces come out better in hollow, because a thick mass of

mostly lead remains hot a long time &amp; eats the

mold.

You can, after the cast is done, mold a the part of the shell

of the belly where you have made the hole on the natural

one, and reattach it with

solder.

X Note that, after your

core is cast, it is

better to put the mold

in hot water to open it, in order

to remove the most wax that you can, always softening

a it in hot water. For the less wax

that remains in it, the better, in order that, when reboiling in large quantity in

the mold when you reheat it, no pustules or lumps are made in

it. And then, if there is hardly any wax, you will not need to

reheat it as much. When opening the mold, the cast will break.

But it can easily be repaired, even though you

cast A

    

the white wax with which you have composed your black

sulfured wax, has such little substance, since being dry and

purified, that it leaves nothing inside, and flows very gently. As for

the charcoal which is mixed in, if some remains, it burns &amp;

reduces to ash &amp; is emptied afterward by blowing through

the gate. You could even open your mold after the wax

has melted, if there is no fanciful thing which could break, like some

reattached thing or similar. After having covered the clamps

with the lute from your sand &amp; having covered all of the

mold, give it on top a layer of common lute, &amp; then

sprinkle this with some pestled brick, in order that you can

handle it better. Let the lute dry slowly before firing it,

which melts the wax. The wax having left through the gate,

that which remains with the charcoal will burn. Being reheated

for the first time, lute it pou once more,

to reheat it the second time because the plaster, not

being good, will have readily made the mold retract, and the

joints will crack open, which might make large flashing. And for the second

time, one ought not to reheat it if you only want to cast in

lead or tin, but rather only make sure that the

lute is quite dry &amp; the mold moderately hot. For

these turtles that have a large size &amp; enough thickness, it

is better to mold ault cast your

lead an alloy half of lead &amp;

half of tin, especially for hollow things. For, if you

only have very thin &amp; very weak things to cast, like flowers, rely

rather on the abundance of lead than of tin, which becomes

porous once cast a little thick, &amp; readily makes some flaw around

the cast. Maistre Alexandre says that he has never gone wrong

with half tin &amp; half lead for things

weighty &amp; with the thickness of the back of a

knife. If there is crocum, the joints hardly

appear, &amp; consequently, the flashing is very small &amp; thin. You can

repair &amp; through the hole of the belly, pull the earth of the

core, leaving it wet a long time;

When you have cast your black wax in the a

mold, &amp; when it is quite cold, you need to the

open your mold halfway, to make the cast. And if the

figure of black wax breaks, there is no danger, for it

can always be reattached with a hot iron touching

point. Or else, if the pieces are not separated from the

mold, qu they meet up &amp; join like

beforehand by joining &amp; binding well the two halves of the

mold. When the figure is large, one needs to cross

inside many iron wires to sustain the core.

    

A

only in lead or

tin. One needs,

however, to redden

the mold nearly as

much as if there were

inside some

animal to burn,

    

in order that the

wax melts well &amp; leaves nothing inside &amp; flows on its

own by keeping the mold leaning toward the gate when

reheating it. And when the mold is reheated, leave it to cool

gently, then blow inside, and draw toward yourself, while sucking, in

order that the ashes of the wax come out. Do this with

bellows.

however, do not remove it until you have completely repaired the

turtle, for you will use this earth as cement if

you need to embed something or repair with the small chisel. If

there is some flashing at the joints of the mold, you will remove

it, either with the burin called a

chaple or a very sharp penknife,

or with a small file, &amp; then with the small

chisel, always having the natural one, to do this better, in

front of you. You can curl on a file the point of a small

chisel which is not quenched to make something lumpy. For these

two turtles &amp; hollow things that

presuppose being large enough, cast your alloy of half

lead &amp; half fine tin. There is more work in

molding a turtle than for twelve molds of flowers. If

there is some crocum in your sand, there will not be

flashing, &amp; if, by some chance, there is some on the sides, it will be

thinner than paper, as long as your mold is tightened

well with a press.

 And to make the scales of turtles

or other animals, you can make some little small chisels in

the fashion of a round cutting-punch, others in the fashion of a

gouge or the scale of a snake &amp; lizard,

and others on a file to make the curly &amp; lumpy bits. The

turtles which are not molded hollow do not have as much work,

for they are molded in two pieces, to repair them with small

chisels, small cutting-punches, small gouges

&amp; small serrated chisels.
