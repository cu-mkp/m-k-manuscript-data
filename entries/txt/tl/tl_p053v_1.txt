on some of the high shelves, & at that time, one knows
when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they
<-hau-> lengthen & raise the head & a part of
the body. At that time one carries them to the heath branches
where they stop & begin to spin their prison, which one calls
cocoon, commonly the size of a pigeon egg, although
one finds much larger ones because it sometimes happens that two or
three & up to xi worms are put in a cocoon, which is hairy
& downy all around, <-&-> the hair of which is
ferret-silk or floret; & from the
cocoon, which is a white, solid, continuous & firm skin, silk
is made. The cocoon is so hard that one only cuts it with difficulty
with a fingernail. And nevertheless, to leave its
prison, <-it-> the worm gnaws it at one end,
& after having stayed inside living on its own sap
<-it-> for three weeks, it comes
out, diminished by half. For when it begins to spin, it is
as long as a ring finger & has eight feet, &
coming out it is shorter by half & only has 4 feet. On the
other hand, it has become a butterfly & has wings, without, however,
flying. And there are male & female. As soon as they come
out of the cocoon, the male charges the female & one puts them on a
white linen, where they make their eggs, which the female would not
make well & profitably if the male was not given to her. And when the
male has detached himself from a female, one needs to throw it out, for it
would not be good to give it to another. They have completed spinning
& making their eggs in three weeks &
around St. John's Day. And at that time one keeps
their eggs & seed until Holy Week, as
<-on-> is said. Some spin among the leaves & make
their cocoon there without climbing high.



The silk of the cocoons where there are




Silkworms

They are produced from seed, that is to say eggs, that which is sold
by the ounce, which is commonly sold in Languedoc iii
lb v s. The one from Spain that
merchants bring there is considered the best because the
worms which come from there are not so subject to illnesses
& make more silk. In Spain, from one ounce of
<-silk-> seed, worms are produced from it which
commonly yield <-ord-> xv lb of silk.
But <-the ounce-> from one ounce of seed
produced in France, only x or xii come out of it. Three
ounces of seed are for producing such a quantity of
worms, that with them you will be able to furnish a room
accomodated with three or 4 levels of large shelves. Willingly
they begin to molt around Holy Week. And to do
this, one puts them in a fir box, like those where one
puts sweetmeats, warmly among feather cushions. And at the
beginning, they molt like <-f-> little
black ants, & as soon as there are two or three molted,
one needs to give them white mulberry leaves.

And then
arrange them on the shelves. And three times per
day, one needs to exchange fresh leaves. And if
during the day there is some thunder or rainy
weather, cloud-covered & cool, one needs to keep in the
room three or 4 chafing dishes <-&-> with
glowing charcoal, & put in incense until all the
room would be filled with smoke. And when the
weather is warm & serain, the silk abounds
more & is all the better for it. Some worms make it whiter,
others more yellowish. And even if it may be white, it yellows when one
draws it with hot water. <-From->
The worms, from their birth until u the <-their->
time when they make their cocoons & their prisons, sleep &
rest 4 times, & each time remain 4 or five days
resting without eating, as if they were dying to be reborn again,
for each time they change skin & begin by molting from the head then
consequently, on different days, the <-s->
rest of the body, & from white turn grayish, & from grayish to
white. <-Finally-> And if one of them has some illness
who does not have the strength to molt, one needs to help it &
be careful not to break it, for at that time rendering a yellow liquor, it is
no longer worth anything. And further they scarcely profit after one has
handled it with the hand. Around Pentecost,
they begin to want to climb on the dry branches of heath or
heather that one prepares for them <-en-> &
attaches
