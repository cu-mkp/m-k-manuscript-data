Windows that the sun will not pass

Take the aforesaid calcined saltpeter & expose it to
a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a
liquor which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the
sun will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One
needs to put the saltpeter on some clean thing
place & it put glowing charcoals on it,
and continue all over until it no longer burns.





It also serves for melting & for adding to alkali salt
for cleaning hands.
