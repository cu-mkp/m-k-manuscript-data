Sal ammoniac and iron dross

I have pulverized sal ammoniac, dried well in the fire &amp;

in a hot bronze mortar, and passed it through the

double sieve; it became very fine. But to render it even more

delicate, I have ground it dry on porphyry. Then, I mixed

it with pulverized &amp; finely ground iron dross, in the same

way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief without being

moistened in the serain, or in the

cellar, or otherwise with the napkin, &amp; it

releases very neatly.
