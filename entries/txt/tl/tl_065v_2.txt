Painting large figures

You need to put your charcoal at the tip of a stick

such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close,

you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain

&amp; sufficient distance. Also, you when you paint up close, hold your

charcoal at the farthest end, &amp; de practically with your

fingertips. For in this way you will acquire an

artistâ€™s l stroke &amp; will render your hand

nimble.
