Candle smoke

It makes it come out neater, & even if it is a little
thick, it does not hold to any place because it has no body. I have thus
fumigated my noyau molds for tin &

beforehand, and it came out very neat. It is true that lead mixed
with half of tin was very hot, because the medal was thick.
