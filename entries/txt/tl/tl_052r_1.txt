The work done in Algiers

Take a colt of three or 4 years &amp; feed it on

rye barley &amp; straw

pig cut in the manner one feeds horses in

Spain, and water it with good fountain or river

water. I do not know if it would be good to water it

occasionally with water of sulfurous baths, &amp; to sometimes

give it fenugreek or other hot foods, for the intention

of the worker is to it to use the heat of its

dung, &amp; the climate here is cooler than that of

Algiers. Keep it in a warm &amp; close place &amp;

so that none of its dung &amp; urine should be lost, of

which you will make a heap or two in order that while one cools, the

other will be at the appropriate heat to continue. Also take a large

glass mattras, as thick as you can, &amp; one

finger thick if it can be done, &amp; of the

capacity of one pitcher or earthen

jug. Around the feast of St. John, put into

it a dozen &amp; a half chicken eggs, that is to say, the

yolk without the glair &amp; the (germ see). Others

say lx yolks. And it will be with this dozen &amp; a

half egg yolks put in half an ounce (others say for lx

eggs half a lb) of female silkworm

seeds. And after having luted the

mattras well (I do not know if it is at all necessary for the

generation that there be air), put it &amp; bury it in the heat of the dung up to

the neck, and leave it there until several f

worms are engendered. And then remove the mattras

&amp; do not bury it in the dung any longer, but only keep it

placed on the hot x layer of the dung

until all the worms will have eaten &amp; consumed one

d another, bustling &amp; stirring, and only one

remains. When this is the case you need to feed it at regular

intervals, day &amp; night, with the aid of two men, who by

intervals will take care of it, and you will feed it with an egg

yolk covered with a gold leaf, or with a liquid egg

yolk with the gold leaf incorporated; &amp; take good care

that it does not want for such food (some say one egg yolk per

hour, others three, but the thing itself will demonstrate the

practice). Nourished in this way it will achieve its growth in two

months or seven weeks &amp; will become like a

snake, one empan &amp; 4

fingers long, &amp; one lb in weight, and as

its wings begin to grow, one will need to put it to death by making

a ring of charcoal fire around the bottle one

empan distant from it, and then stopper &amp;

lute the bottle well in order that it does not

exhale.

Or to be safer, retire from there until the fire has died down &amp;

all is cooled, Ap for its exhalation would be

dangerous. And for the occasion when you

feed it with pincers,

b wash your mouth with good vinegar

&amp; take some preservative &amp; plug yourself up well. Once it is

dead, put it in a linen cloth or a canvas of silk &amp;

fold it &amp; hang it from the ceiling, where the air

or &amp; sun dry it. Once it is quite dry,

pulverize it in a mortar. And keep this powder carefully,

because one ℥ of this thrown on iii lb of molten

♁ reduces it to finer ☉ than the other one. But it does not

have as much  weight. For this work you also

need to choose the oldest ♁ that you can, which has often been

melted &amp; finely hammered into sheets or other works, &amp; purify it

before by melting &amp; throwing it into honey &amp;

vinegar. The term of the work is nine months from

the feast of St. John  until the 25th of April.
