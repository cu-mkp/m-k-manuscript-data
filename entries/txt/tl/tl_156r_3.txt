Chasing

Lead is so fatty &amp; soft that one cannot strike it boldly,

&amp; one needs to have a very light hand. The other great

metals are easier. With a burin called the

onglet you make &amp; retrace the more delicate lines,

with the ordinary engraving burin the broader ones, and with

the chaple you remove the big flashing, and with the

small chisels you soften the harshness of the lines, you smooth, you

add relief to a line.
