 For telling someone that you will
 
  show
 
 teach him something
he does not know, and neither do you
 


  Take a
  
   string
  
  or a
  
   small stick
  
  and take the
measurement
  
   from the tip of his
   
    ear
   
   to the tip of his
   
    nose
   

  and show it to him. Thus you will teach him something
you did not know, and neither did he.
