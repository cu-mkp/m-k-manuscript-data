Glass vessels

The glass vessel must be made like a pear or round

pyramid, of the thickness of a small knife back, round

on the bottom without bending like vials, its opening of such a

size that a Dutch quill can just about fit

in, &amp; with a lip at the end. Thus of a height of seven

fingersâ€™ width.
