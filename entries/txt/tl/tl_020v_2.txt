Against winds, colic, &amp;c

Sap squeezed or water  distilled from
orange peel is excellent against the windy colic.
Candied peel, too, is excellent for the winds of the
belly. And to make a trial of it, having poured foaming
wine in a glass, squeeze orange
juice on the wine foam, which proceeds only from vapor &amp;
wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also,
if you squeeze juice against a candle it will burn all
the brighter.
