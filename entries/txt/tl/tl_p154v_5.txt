Strawberries

The leaves are cast separately & then are joined with
solder. And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid,
& by that means is heavy, and the tin stem which is delicate
will not be able to hold it up without soon breaking, one makes the
stems with latten wire & then one solders & joins
them.
