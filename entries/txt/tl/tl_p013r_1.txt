Flesh color from arsenic

Sublimated arsenic, that is to say, the white one that is
sold as stone, when ground on marble, mixed with
vermilion or lake or minium, makes a beautiful
flesh color that is always shiny. Yellow arsenic has a very
beautiful color, the white one is good in oil and agrees well
with the lake.
