Frame casting

It is good to make it with boxwood. Turn it in order
to make it even, as this is important for the casting. Lute also,
or cover the mouth of the frame with sand in order that the melted
metal, or lead, or copper does not touch the
frameâ€™s iron or latten, because it makes it
brittle, & makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always
higher than the mold. Also guard against the cast being too
wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
the weight of the substance that runs breaks & shakes loose the
mold & makes it porous. When you have cast, gently tap the
frame, in order that the substance spreads better. Black lead of
saulmon from the first melting makes a very neat one.
