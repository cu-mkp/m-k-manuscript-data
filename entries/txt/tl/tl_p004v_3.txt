Varnish of iron engravers

Take linseed oil or walnut oil
&, in place of black pitch, you will put in a little
pitch resin, & it needs to be cooked in the fashion of black
varnish on fire. And for applying it, heat your iron &
give it only one layer of varnish, & when it no longer
smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a steel point
whatever you want. Next take salt &
verdigris & mix as much of one as of the other in quite
strong vinegar & leave it for xx4 hours
before using it, & all will be tempered. Next spread some of this
liquor or sauce on the engraved object with a sponge











or linen & leave it thus for xx4
hours & it will be engraved. But if you should
want to engrave promptly, varnish all your work & boil it in the
said liquor, & it will promptly engrave.
