 Flowers
 
  When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves
upright, pass a
  
   thread
  
  through the
  
   mold
  
  to keep them
from rising up, & cast the
  
   sand
  
  little by little, & always blow
strongly in order that it settles everywhere, otherwise it will become
lumpy.
 

  Because you did not put in this a
  

    clay
   
   slab
  
  , the
  
   mold
  
  sometimes holds to the
  
   table
  
  where you cast it.
To undo it, hit a great blow of a
  
   hammer
  
  at the side of the
  
   table
  
  .
 



  It is enough to reheat
  

  your
  

    luted
   


   mold
  
  once
  

  for flowers & to heat it the second time
  

  if you cast with
  
   tin
  
  &
  
   lead
  
  ,
  

  for with
  
   gold
  
  &
  
   silver
  
  , one needs
  

  to reheat it twice.
 

  Cast your
  
   tin
  
  very red in the
  
   mold
  
  ,
  
   of
such heat that you can hold your
   

     finger
    

   there without harm in the hole
  
  .
