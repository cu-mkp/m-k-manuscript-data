Petards




Petards are made of the best alloy of metal & fine
rosette that one can, in order that they do not burst,
namely one part of metal & two of fine
rosette or old cauldron, which is even better. Some
are of fifteen or seventeen lb & <-ch-> are
loaded with two & a half lb of good grain
powder, & they are for applying on windows & common doors.
Others are of the weight of 25 to 27 lb and are loaded with 4
lb of powder. Others weigh 45 lb & are
loaded with eight lb of powder. And thus they are formed
according to the effort they have to make. On the outside, they are <-e->
of a regular shape, but on the inside, they are made like a
crucible, 





 narrower on the inside of the breech & becoming wider
toward the mouth. And this is to give force to the breech, because of
the quantity of powder they hold, & so that they do not
burst. <-At the breech one gives them-> Those of 45 lb
have a thickness of eight lines at the breech & become
thinner on the inside toward the muzzle, which is of 4 lines.
They are xii thumbs breadth long & seven in diameter at
the muzzle & opening.












Those of 27 lb or thereabouts are ix inches long & six in
diameter at the muzzle. At the breech, they are vi lines thick,
& 3 at the muzzle. The ones weighing 17 lb are 8
inches long & five at the muzzle. One covers them all
together, all the forks & pegs &
tools which one uses, with a thick canvas or thick
cloth in order that they do not make any noise. It
<-s-> is good that they should sit loaded for some time.
After one has put the powder in, one tamps it down quite
thoroughly, and then one puts in pressed paper, then a 
cake of wax 
well tamped down, & on the wax another plate of
cork that goes in quite precisely & with force. In this way,
the powder remains well sealed & gives much greater violence,
& if you wish, you can put on the plate of cork one of
wood pierced in the middle, if the petard is pierced at the
breech, which one holds to be the easiest, & which makes for greater
penetration because it cannot recoil. And for those that have a pierced
breech, one must have a good gimlet to first make the hole in
order that the peg, which is made <-in-> with a
gimlet-like point, may attach the petard faster & without
noise. And <-to-> for these, one must cover the button, which is
quite evenly filed, <-p-> with waxed canvas, or
add wax to it in order that it precisely plugs the hole of the
breech. But because the doors are sometimes iron-clad & the
iron pegs cannot pierce it, one uses an iron
fork made like pincers & another iron rod
<-q-> made with three claws at the end, as you see
depicted. And in this way, the petard holds itself well & is quickly
placed. The iron pegs must extend from the petard with
the entire point that is made like a gimlet, namely by three or
4 fingers, which goes entirely <-l->
into the door. When the petards are placed, one fills the touch-hole
with good pulverin and
<-s-> one puts in it a feather quill filled with
powder tightly pressed & moistened with vinegar, or,
if needed, one presses the powder in the hollow of the hand &
having wetted it with saliva, one makes from it
something like a cocoon or






    


a peg which one puts into the touch-hole, & then, with
a rope wrapped around the end of a stick, one gives fire &
promptly retreats to take cover. The small petards of 16 or 17
lb are attached promptly with a short hooked peg made
like a wimble, & if the petard
is of a good alloy, one can give fire by hand just as one does
with petards of 27 lb, but then one only puts in three
lb of powder. It must certainly be a strong door if the
seventeen lb petard does not blow it up. Some use little
bells worn by oxen or mules on a
peasant door. Others load two pistol barrels &, with a
gimlet & a string, attach them with the muzzle
against the door. If the petards are good & do not explode, they
only recoil and cannot do harm if one is next to them.

A. This is a small peg, hooked like the hinge of a door
& made like a gimlet on one end, for quickly
attaching a small petard with ear of fifteen or xvii lb for a
common door or window.

B. This is a small petard with ears.

C. This is a <-gro-> common petard of 27 or 30 lb
pierced at the breech, through which a large iron peg
passes, button-like on one end & made like a
gimlet at the point, for quickly attaching the petard
against a door that <-does not have-> is not
covered with iron plates.

D. These are plates of wax, cork & wood
for loading the petard & sealing the powder well.

E. <-This-> Iron fork made in the form of pincers
of the height of a man, to quickly place the mortar
without a peg. It must be of soft iron in order
that its branches bend easily, if need be, to fit to the height or width
of the door.

F. This is another iron fork of the same height that
props up the fork made like pincers & also supports the
petard, and with its claw at the bottom prevents the pincers
from recoiling.










G. Petard with ear, placed with its
peg.

H. Knife-like saws to cut a portcullis, if needed.

I. The large iron pegs which traverse & attach
the petard.

K. These are common iron pegs, very round &
covered with canvas, like all the rest, to turn the large
iron pegs pierced close to the head.

L. Axes that one must always carry to finish breaking down,
if by chance the petard has left anything whole.

M. A large mallet of wood for knocking down what was
begun & weakened by the saws or
gimlets.

N. Are large augers & gimlets of
wheelwrights for smoothly cutting a door or window by
making large holes close to one another.

O. Crutches of the height of a man, which it is
necessary to carry to quickly put under a portcullis after the petard
has gone off & to prevent the portcullis from falling.

P. Are small iron pincers for putting some petard
low on the straight part of the bolt or strap hinge of
the door.
