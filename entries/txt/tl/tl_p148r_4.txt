Crocum ferri

To make this quickly, redden the filings in an
iron case, stirring it often. Then sprinkle it with
good vinegar & let it evaporate, & without removing it
from atop the fire, let it redden & inflame. Once cooled, pulverize
it on marble & return it to the fire,
rou sprinkle with vinegar, and then inflame.
Thus it will quickly be colored & made fine.
