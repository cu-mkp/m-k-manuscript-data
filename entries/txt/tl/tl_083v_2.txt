Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other

It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper, latten or

similar metal, very neatly, and then when you have molded the

hollow form in the sand, leave the figure of metal that you

s have molded in the frame, without moving it

from its place. And cast, &amp; if there is not enough thickness press a

little &amp; push the figure down in the frame.

It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but

with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at

the entry of the medal, &amp; there, where the force is, the

filth &amp; grime accumulate. And, in this way, if you

were mold the face toward the cast, some grime could be found

there, &amp; it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier

to repair.

Vinegar is better for moistening than wine. It is

necessary that the frame be quite smooth and even, otherwise

and that the cast be, as you press on one side, the other one

lifts.

This is why the press is better, for it tightens evenly, &amp;

more than your hands, and makes

the coarse sand, which is damp, communicate its humidity to the

soft &amp; fine sand, which is sprinkled &amp; pounced dry

on the medal.

When you mold, always leave your medal in one of

the frames, is without stirring

it because, if your hollow form is not molded very neatly, you can put

it back in the right place by means of pegs, which will prevent

it from shifting. But, at first, pounce your medal with very

fine willow charcoal, &amp; se next

clean it, for this degreases it, &amp; makes it easier to release afterward.

Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the

frame &amp; the sand.
