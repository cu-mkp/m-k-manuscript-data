 One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they
ont wilt & dry out. Dip them, therefore,
immediately in good eau-de-vie & then put them in your
tempered sand mold, like snakes. For which one needs no
release, for while the molds are being 
reheated s s, the plant burns, which does not happen with
animals that have bones & q. It is necessary
that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes
because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.
