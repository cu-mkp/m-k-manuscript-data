Gilding

One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very soft, file such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heats them,
&amp; passes them as is said. But to gild
&amp; gild with silver, they ought not to pass more than a little
beyond blue. Then, while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a vise,
&amp; with some tweezers, one layers the gold, &amp; one
sets it with bloodstone that is quite clean &amp; rubbed with
putty. And when the guards are cold, one reheats them,
then one layers the gold as above. And first, one gives
of two layers, until the entire guard is well-garnished. And
next, one reheats as at the beginning, &amp; one gives the third covering
of gold. Then, one burnishes very thoroughly &amp; with great
force with a large bloodstone. And But note that
to burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to
know this, one smells it &amp; brings it close to the
nose. For one ought not to touch it with the
fingers, but one holds it on lifts it from on top of
the warm ashes with a small iron rod, which has
been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is
completely well-burnished, one rubs it very well with a white
linen cloth, and the gold needs to be thicker &amp;
stronger than for painters. A quarteron is worth
fifty or lx sous.
