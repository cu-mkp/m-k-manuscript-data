Whitening

If it is for silver, do not pestle your tartar with

iron but with the handle of a hammer, for if you touch

&amp; dip iron in your whitening, the silver would

become red like copper &amp; you would need to reheat it &amp;

put it again in whitening. Mix nothing with your tartar

that should not enter the whitening, for this corrupts it. Do not

let it spill out of its first boil, for in this is all its strength. The

whitening is made with one part pulverized tartar

&amp; a half of common salt.
