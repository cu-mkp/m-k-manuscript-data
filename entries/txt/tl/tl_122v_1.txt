Cleaning the bowl and the spoon with which one

tempers the sand

Be careful to clean, as soon as &amp; quickly after you have cast,

your bowl &amp; your spatula or spoon with

which you temper your sand, because il if it dries in

them, it crumbles &amp; falls into the fresh sand &amp; makes a hole or

a fault in the work. Also, when the mold is reheated, these

little pieces crust up &amp; flake off &amp; prevent neat

casting.
