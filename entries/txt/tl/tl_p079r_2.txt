For making water for disease of the eyes



Take white copperas, & heat it a little on the fire, then put
it as a powder on a white cloth stretched over a very clean
glass, & the powder on top, then take
fountain water & pass it through the said
cloth, while stirring the said powder with the
finger until it has all gone through. Then wash your
<-v-> eyes at any hour you wish
& with the help of God, you will find yourself very well from it.
