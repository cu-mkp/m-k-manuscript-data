I have cast with it the cleanest I have seen, in very small

figures &amp; thin as paper. I have cast very hot in the

very red mold, and have put in the melted substance of

this the two substances compositions,

which make silver run, &amp; have made as if I had wanted to

cast pure silver. This alloy is white in

bullitoire, like any alloys which resemble, however

little, ☾. For casting something delicate, use

this one.
