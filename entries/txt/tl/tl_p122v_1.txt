Cleaning the bowl and the spoon with which one
tempers the sand

Be careful to clean, as soon as & quickly after you have cast,
your bowl & your spatula or spoon with
which you temper your sand, because <-il-> if it dries in
them, it crumbles & falls into the fresh sand & makes a hole or
a fault in the work. Also, when the mold is reheated, these
little pieces crust up & flake off & prevent neat
casting.
