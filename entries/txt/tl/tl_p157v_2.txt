 Molding a
 
  bird
 

  One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
on a
  

    clay
   
   slab
  
  , and hide & sink within it half the
said
  
   bird
  
  ,
  
   in order
  
  that it only shows one leg
& one foot, then you will anoint it with
  
   butter
  
  to make it
hold the feathers down, finally
  
   of
   
    oil
   


   eau-de-vie
  
  . And then cast. And being set, clean &
uncover whatever needs it. Next, mold the other side in the same way. But
because the feet, being of
  
   bone
  
  that is difficult to burn & which
are not able to be cleaned neither by
  
   quicksilver
  

   If
  
  nor by any other means, if the
  
   mold
  
  would not
open, uncover the bottom of the feet & the toe or the little finger
of the claw, & mold as a separate piece. Reheat & open your
  
   mold
  
  & clean the
  
   bones
  
  . The feet usually remain too
weak to support the mass of a
  
   solid bird
  
  . And for this reason,
one adapts an
  

    iron wire
   

  in the
  
   mold
  
  of the
feet which passes into the body before casting; thus, they are
reinforced. Some mold the wings in a
  
   frame
  
  . Others mold the
head & the said wings separately
  
   en noyau
  
  , then join &
repair them to first model a form that will be stiff & withstand the
  
   tempered sand
  
  .
  


  They are skinned & filled with
  

    cotton cloth
   

  . &
even better, one needs to dress them in the fashion that
  
   curriers
  
  do, in order that they do not lose a
  
   feather
  
  , weight.
  

  The
dressing is
  
   alum
  
  &
  
   paste of flour
  
  .
