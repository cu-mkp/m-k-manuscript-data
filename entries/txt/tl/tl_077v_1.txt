Another approved varnish

Take two ounces of linseed oil &amp; two
ounces of petrolle oil and two
ounces of mastic, the whitest you can find, and of
glass alum, &amp; grind it, and take a little bit of
white copperas, and put all these drugs together into an
earthen pot that should be new, and lay it on hot
ashes for a bit, and you will see a beautiful
varnish.
