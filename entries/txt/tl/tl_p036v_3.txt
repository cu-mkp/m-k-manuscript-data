Glassworkers' glass

One says that in Lorraine & in Flanders
well-made glass is made of fern ashes &
pebbles, and first they blow a long bubble, which another
worker, with long shears, cleaves & cuts lengthwise.
Then, having set this long, cleft bubble on a stone or
large plate that is in the furnace, a little less
hot than for the melt, it is left to stretch out. And again in
addition to this, they flatten it with a long & thick round
iron rod, then they remove it to the annealing furnace. 
It is made in the same way in England more beautifully.
Near Rouen in France, plate glass is made with
some <-salt of-> saltwort & pebbles,
that is whiter & more delicate than that of Lorraine. For
plate glass can be melted with a candle & not that
from Lorraine. That of plate is blown in a long bubble, of which
another cuts the end, then the blower flattens it while turning it &
while touching it to a surface that is on the ground,
<-A-> then puts it to anneal. Thus the
middle, whence it is begun, still remains.



The glass can be cleft again with the light of a candle
by wetting, but not as precisely as with the hot iron.
