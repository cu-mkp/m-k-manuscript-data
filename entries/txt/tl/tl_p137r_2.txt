 to make

 run
 
  Take some
  
   â˜¿ sublimate of
   
    Venice
   

  ,
true & not
  
   arsenic sublimate
  
  , a
  
   pea
  
  ,
  

    aes
ustum
   

  , a
  
   pea
  
  ,
  
   sal ammoniac
  
  , a
  
   pea
  
  .
Pulverize everything separately, & next mix everything in a
  

    glass
   
   bottle
  
  & put on
  
   hot ash
  
  . You will see
that everything dissolves like
  
   wax
  
  , making many colors. Let it
  
   everything
  
  set & put a little of it on each
  

    melted
   
   metal
  
  , & it will run marvelously.
 



   Founders of large casts for statues
  
  throw in much
  
   tartar
  
  to clean it of its
  
   filth
  
  &
  
   nastiness
  
  ,
& much
  
   sal ammoniac
  
  to render it thin & neat. And when
they want to cast, they put in much
  
   tin
  
  . The
  
   cold &
humidity
  
  strongly disagrees with it, which renders dangerous the
work of the
  
   founder
  
  , for one only needs a
  

    spring
   
   of
   
    water
   
   in the pit
  
  to lose everything.
