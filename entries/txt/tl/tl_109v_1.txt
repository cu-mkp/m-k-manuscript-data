Toad

If by chance you want to mold this vile animal, &amp; if it were to

piss in your hand, it would burn your hand

&amp; itch, as if you had handled nettles. But the most

powerful remedy for this is to put your hand into

fresh earth &amp; to cover it as if you wanted to bury it.

A frog is not so beautiful molded because it has lively skin,

&amp; the other has a lumpy one.

You can mold it hollow, and leaving under its belly an open notch, you

will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw. Or else, if

it is small, put it on a magnet of its size, cut thinly, then

put it in good vinegar.

When it is big, one needs to mold it hollow, &amp; if you want to make

it have an open mouth, put some cotton inside, &amp; then on the

cotton some melted wax.
