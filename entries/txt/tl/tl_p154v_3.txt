 Casting
 
  of
  
   silver
  





   Silver
  
  needs a longish gate. For
  
   gold
  
  it does not
matter.
  

    Silver
   
   , when soldering, tolerates the
   
    water
   
   one throws on it. But
   
    gold
   
   would spatter, &
   
    needs
that
   
   for that reason, one casts
   

     solder
    


    bran
   
   on the
   
    solder
   
   .
  


  Let the
  
   mold
  
  cool well after the casting before opening
it.
