Latten

It is very capricious to cast. It must be cast very hot. And to better
achieve your goal, throw on it some sal ammoniac to thin it. Alloy
it as well with a little red copper and, when you want to cast, a
little tin to make it run better. It always leaves a tail like
melted glass. It does not require as long a gate as
others.
