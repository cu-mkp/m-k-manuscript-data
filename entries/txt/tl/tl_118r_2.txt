For removing flashing and barbs from things molded Ã  noyau

If your molds are of good plaster which withstands

well the fire, &amp; they will not crack at all, especially

if, with presses, they are squeezed well between two

boards or in a vessel filled with ashes or

sand, &amp; in this way they will make no flashing. But if they do

make some, you can remove it with a burin that one calls

chaple, which has a tip like a small

chisel.
