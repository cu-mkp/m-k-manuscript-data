For casting in plaster

Melt some wax, & with a large brush coat the
relief of which you want to have the hollow form, as if you wanted to paint
it. And a light crust upon which qu will form,
upon which you will cast you plaster, to give it body
and strength. Next, in the hollow form of wax, you will also cast your
plaster in order to have your relief, & it will release very
easily because of the wax. This is done more for large
pieces in high relief than for others.
