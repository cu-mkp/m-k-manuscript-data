Molds

Make the two sides so that they are, es if it is

possible, one as thickness as the other, in order that they

can be quite evenly reheated. When you mold some animal that should be

burned you, like crayfish, you cannot open it to

clean it, &amp; make the cast so that it is not reheated. And when they

are reheated one time, keep them scarcely at all without casting, for

they are rendered musty &amp; moist, &amp; the mold is undone

&amp; loses its strength.

The part where the back of the animal is is usually thicker.
