Candles

They keep well in bran which makes them white &amp;
long-lasting, so say some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep
them in a cool &amp; dry place, in such manner that they are
not pressed together. It is better if there is a hemp
thread throughout the wick, which gives it more light &amp; makes the wick hold up
straighter. Otherwise, if it is all of cotton, as those of
Montauban make, it is necessary to snuff it out often, for
after it has burnt il a little, the cotton
droops &amp; makes the candle drip.
