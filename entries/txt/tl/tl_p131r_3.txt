For adorning beds, mirrors, and
suchlike

Rough out some design in half relief on a quite flat
slate to adapt it to either round or flat things. And having
cast it in mixed tin, quite thin, you can gild it with
gold leaf & adapt it to whatever you want, and fill the
vui bottom of the relief with small rubies,
orpiment & little grains of diverse colors.
