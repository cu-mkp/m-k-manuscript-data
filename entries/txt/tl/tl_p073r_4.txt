For making gray wood

Take alum with river water, make them boil together,
then take river water with bran, submerge the bran
and beat it together. Take iron filings & sulfur &
verdigris and grindings , and make
it all boil together, and pound maplewood which will
have been soaked in alum water and well water, &
put it to boil together. All of this will be done better in a hollow
grais.
