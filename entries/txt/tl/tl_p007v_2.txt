Against windy colic

Take a dozen dried common walnuts &
throw them one after another into a good brazier where they may
catch fire, & take them out with small pincers, and let them burn
& flame well in the air, and extinguish them in a glass
of good wine. Next, let the wine cool and strain it,
& pour half of it, for six extinguished
walnuts are for one dose. Excellent cure
against the suffocation of the matrix.
