Take white copperas, &amp; heat it a little on the fire, then put

it as a powder on a white cloth stretched over a very clean

glass, &amp; the powder on top, then take

fountain water &amp; pass it through the said

cloth, while stirring the said powder with the

finger until it has all gone through. Then wash your

v eyes at any hour you wish

&amp; with the help of God, you will find yourself very well from it.
