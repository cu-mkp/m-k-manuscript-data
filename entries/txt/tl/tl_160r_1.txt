Press for the large molds

They are two sheets of iron attached by four

small iron pillars, in such a way, however, that

they the upper are is able to have play

&amp; run freely the length of the pillars, &amp; that the

lower one is fixed. At the end of the pillars is affixed an

iron St. Andrew's cross, in the middle of which is a

screw which tightens the sheets against the

molds which are between the two. Or, for small molds,

one makes a frame, &amp; having put the molds between

two plates of iron, one sets tightens them in

the frame with wedges. The large wooden

presses made with screws, besides being heavy to put near to the

forge for casting, one cannot know when they tighten too much,

&amp; very often, they break the mold.

The screw is riveted to this stirrup, which is

nailed onto the upper plate, &amp; by this means,

raises it &amp; presses it.
