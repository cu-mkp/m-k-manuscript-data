Counterfeit diamonds put in a work

Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with black modeling wax, 
then anoint the inside, thus waxed, with
wheat oil, &amp; then powder this with lamp smoke,
for it is necessary that ceste its color not have
luster for false stones. This done, set in your stone
&amp; then with a bit of wax, then, with a
steel point &amp; a small finishing hammer,
join the edge of the setting to the stone in order that
daylight does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
stone, which would break.
