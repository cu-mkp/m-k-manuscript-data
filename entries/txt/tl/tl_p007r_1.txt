For gilding with gold color and tinsel

Once you have gilded colored, make your
stamping either in tin, as is said, or
in iron dest or copper. You ought not
to put a layer of glue there as on wood, but take only
fatty oil, which is made in seven or eight days in
the sun with walnut oil and lead white &
with, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in
haste. Then, with the oil thus made fatty, grind a little lead
white, massicot & mine de plomb
, at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
Minium gives color to the gold. Next, with this, you make
a layer of it evenly on your stamping, taking care not to fill the hollows.
And once it is almost dry, lay the gold leaf on it with
cotton. Such gold will hold up in the rain on
houses & elsewhere. And if you have gilded with tinsel, color
it with smoke of partridge or of yellow or red
cloth, & it will be beautiful like fine gold. You can
cover trunks, mirrors, valences & bedposts with colored
velvet or satin, then apply the gilded stampings
on top with strong glue.
