Advice concerning the gate

<-Do not-> Be careful to not make your gate very wide, and do not
forget to make in its conduit two or three holes and notches, & as
your gate approaches the <-ch-> molded thing, divide it
into three or four parts like fingers which are pointed &
are not very deep. For the metal runs more gently without being
hindered by vapors & fumes.



Always make
the entry of the gate
near the medal
notched & lumpy,
to draw out the fury of the
metal.
