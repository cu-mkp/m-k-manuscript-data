gate being made by wax, you are in no danger of encrusting
something from the molded animal. And it is more expedient to make
thus the gate of wax, to cast the second mold on top, than to
wait to do them after the mold is
reheated <-q->, for at that point, it is necessary, if
possible, that everything be ready. One needs to heat well & evenly
redden the molds where there are gates of wax, in order
that it melts well & leaves nothing inside.
