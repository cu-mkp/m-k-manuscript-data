Bellows furnace

Before putting in the metal, it is necessary that it be red

at the bottom, like a charcoal &amp; well inflamed. Next,

you  fill it &amp; cover the charcoal &amp;

adjust the bellows, otherwise the metal on top would

melt by means of the bellows &amp; its bottom would be

curdled &amp; cooled &amp; would not run. But if you proceed in this

manner you will melt everything you like.
