Base gold from Germany,

electrum

One calls it gold from the Rhine, which one finds

in the rivers, and is spangle gold.

Goldsmiths from Germany wanted to refine it,

thinking to separate it from this whiteness, which they deemed to be

silver. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that

this whiteness is fixed, &amp; it does not lack color. This is

electrum, from which one can make cups

which will demonstrate poison.
