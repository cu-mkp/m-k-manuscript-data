  diamonds put in a work
 

  Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with
  
   black modeling wax
  
  , 
then anoint the inside, thus
  
   waxed
  
  , with
  

    wheat
   
   oil
  
  , & then powder this with
  
   lamp smoke
  
  ,
for it is necessary that
  
   this
  
  its color not have
luster for
  
   false stones
  
  . This done, set in your
  
   stone
  

   & then
  
  with a bit of
  
   wax
  
  , then, with a
  

    steel
   
   point
  
  & a
  
   small finishing hammer
  
  ,
join the edge of the setting to the
  
   stone
  
  in order that
  
   daylight
  
  does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
  
   stone
  
  , which would break.
