For layering gold in distemper

Common painters &amp; scribes make
batture, that is joinerâ€™s glue tempered with
water on the fire, moderately clear, mixed with very little
honey, that is to say a few drops to make it stick. And
with it they form letters, or that which they want to gild,
with a paintbrush, and immediately after layer the
gold, but they never do their work quite neatly, and if there is
a lot of honey it dries only with great difficulty. This layer is
undone in the rain.

Others do better, they temper candy sugar in water and
mix it with sanguine that they call
cocon, thoroughly ground, adding in a little
soap. This is done neatly, &amp; renders gold beautiful if
one uses it as the seat.
