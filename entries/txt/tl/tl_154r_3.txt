Sweetening silver

When goldsmiths who work large wares have

forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that

it bursts &amp; cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,

when it is well melted, some dry mortar composed of sand &amp;

good lime which has been worked, &amp; pulverize it &amp; throw

it in.

Goldsmiths do not work at all with

the silver from reals that is not alloyed, because it is

leady &amp; when forging it sours.

Some solder, for small works &amp; things which only go in the fire

once, with some old sou &amp; carolus, reheated &amp; beaten. 

However, if the sou is not very

good, the solder eats away &amp; one needs to solder there twice,

&amp; one finds there too much copper. Others solder with

half silver &amp; half fine copper.
