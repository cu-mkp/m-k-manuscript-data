   cendr√©e
  


  of azure
 
 for
 
  oil
 

  The one that accumulates in small clods and is lumpy is
the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is very
pale in color, because
  
   oil
  
  darkens it. Certain
  
   sophisticators
  
  mix them, but you will know this if you pour
some onto a piece of
  
   paper
  
  & press it & spread it with
the
  

    finger
   

  since, if it is mixed, it will be found
variegated & as if striped with a pale one & a darker one, but if it is
unmixed it will be even & of one color.
