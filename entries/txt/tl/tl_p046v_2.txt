  Shoemaker
 

  If he wants to do some tanned work on
  
   black leather
  
  shoes, he
can dip a
  
   writing quill
  
  in
  
   oil of sulfur
  
  and paint with
it what he would like on shoes, boots, and
  
   colets
  
  .
  

  And he will obtain a
reddish color which will not disappear by any effort.
