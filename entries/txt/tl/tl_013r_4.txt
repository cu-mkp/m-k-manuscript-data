Fine sieves of raw silk

One makes tammy of raw silk on a loom, to make

fine &amp; delicate sieves. And for that effect, you must not

choose raw silk whitened by sulfur smoke, which

renders the silk chas charged with a sticky

vapor that would hold the flour &amp; in the end would prevent it

from

passing through so well. But choose for that effect yellow raw &amp;

natural silk because it is stronger &amp; casts out flour

like horsehair.
