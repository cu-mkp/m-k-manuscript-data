Catching passerines

If they sleep in straw, like they usually do,

close to the house, leave the closest window open &amp; put

in a lighted candle, but so that the candle is hidden

&amp; that its light only appears throughout the room &amp; through the

window, and all will enclose themselves in the room. But it is necessary

that the night be dark &amp; without

☾.
