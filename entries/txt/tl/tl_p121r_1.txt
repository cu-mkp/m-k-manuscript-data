 For keeping fruits all
 
  year
 

  One needs to pick them in
  

    serain
   
   &
   

     s
    

   quite dry weather
  
  & by the stem without
  
   touching
  

   it
  
  the fruit with your
  
   hand
  
  , and
put them in
  

    glass
   
   bottles
  
  that have a wide
opening, like tall
  

    glass
   
   boxes
  
  for putting preserves.
Fortify them with
  
   straw
  
  or something else so that they may not
break, and seal them well with
  
   wax
  
  so that they may not breathe.
And if they had a
  
   glass
  
  lid, well-sealed with
  
   wax
  
  , they
would be all the better. Put them in a
  
   case
  
  in your
  
   well
  
  , or in your
  
   cellar
  
  in a
  

    vat
   
   , or in a
   
    cos
   


   of earth full of
   
    water
   

  .
 

  For where the
  
   hand
  
  will
  
   touch
  
  , it will rot,
and it is even good not to
  
   breathe
  
  on them. You can also put in
  
   leaves from
   
    vine
   

  .
