Advice about the above

Good tin is that which is hard as silver

&amp; soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all

tin &amp; alloyed as is said.

Looking-glass tin must not be smoked mixed until

the instant that you want to cast.

 Nor must the forms be smoked until then.

 If the sand shrinks in the frame, this means that it must

be reheated &amp; reddened on the fire.

Good sand, when moistened, does not stick at all to the

hand when pressed.

The perfect sand for the frame is

aspalt, which is found in

Germany, which is soft as flour &amp; presq

when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.

Nota that the cast must be thin &amp; hardly thick

in order that it does not overtax the material, and must not

exceed the thickness of un the width of a grain of

wheat; likewise for tin, which wants to be cast

very thinly. For lead, a little thicker. There is no need to make

the vents very large &amp; deep either.

For frames, the sand that you use for the noyau, of the

aforesaid composition, is excellent. But in washing, crushing &amp;

reheating it several times, it must be corrupt from its nature &amp; no longer fit to make a hold &amp; to mold en noyau.
