 Molding with
 


    cuttlefish
   
   bone
  


  Guard against keeping them
  
   in a humid place
  
  , for they are
very prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the
  
   bone
  
  in two, then even it out with a
  
   knife
  
  . And on a
  
   hooked
   
    roof tile
   

  , quite dry & quite smoothed & covered with
  
   pulverized
   
    willow
   
   charcoal
  
  , rub & smooth the two
halves of the
  

    bones
   

  . Thus they imbibe this
  

    willow
   
   charcoal
  
  , which makes them release well & guards against removing
anything. Then, on a
  

    counter bone
   

  , that is to say a piece of
  
   brick
  
  evened to the size of your
  

    bone
   

  , place
your medal, & then on this one, place the
  

    bone
   

  ,
& press well with some other piece of the same size on the top. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, pounce on top with
  

    willow
   
   charcoal
  
  & blow lightly, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole
  

    bones
   

  . All cast work is brittle & subject to
breaking, because the
  
   metal
  
  expands when cast, & retracts
& condenses under the
  
   hammer
  
  . That is why one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a
  
   chisel
  
  , & in this way the
  
   metal
  
  retracts. Let it thus
  
   escrouir
  
  . If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the
  
   mold
  
  & hollow it
with a
  
   penknife
  
  to make way for the medal, & then
mold. And if the medal has two sides
 

  Before casting, heat the
  

    bones
   

  in order to make them lose only the coldness &
moisture.
 

  When the
  
   lead
  
  gets too hot, it
calcines.
 



  since the two
  

    bones
   

  are joined,
  

    co
   

  cut them evenly all around, & make notches
  

    e
   

  around it in different places which cross over the
join of the two
  

    bones
   

  , in order to recognize well the
place of the first join. Or else, with little
  
   shards of
   
    wood
   

  , pierce them, or
  

    ma
   

  coat the
joins with some
  
   clay
  
  , & dry. Press,
  
   between them
  
  your
  

    hands
   
   joined between your
   
    two
   
   knees
  
  & not with a
  
   press
  
  , because the
  

    bones
   

  would
crack. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see
that it is pressed quite tightly together & well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, pounce with some
  

    willow
   
   charcoal
  
  , for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with
  
   oil
  
  & with
  

    willow
   
   charcoal powder
  
  & with a
  
   brush
  
  , to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not too greasy or
  
   oily
  
  when you mold in
  


     cuttlefish
    
    bone
   

  . When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some
  

    bone
   

  . And cast moderately hot,
which you will know when the
  

    bone
   

  is about to change
its
  
   good
  
  whiteness. But when it is too hot, it turns
the
  

    bone
   

  very red. The
  
   proportion
  
  of
  
   lead
  
  &
  
   tin
  
  is as much of one as of the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out & of several pieces, make the gate forked with three or
four grooves,
  
   and
  

   make
  
  & direct these grooves to the
place of the thicker parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like straight on the heads, for this attracts the
  
   metal
  
  & feeds
the figure better. Shake your
  
   frame
  
  a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts.
  
   Tin
  
  that is too
hot
  

    p
   

  burns
  

  the
  

    bone
   

  , which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out
  
   from the
   
    mo
   

  hot from the
  
   mold
  
  , it risks
breaking.
