You will see that it will torment it & heat it very well and soon
render it very liquid & ready to cast and be clarified, as it should
be. When it is in this state & when it is very white and polished,
shining like quicksilver, prepare yourself to cast. And to this
effect, have some lean delicate sand, in a
terrine or another vessel, that you would
like to help yourself to. Make a pit in your sand, then, with your
pincers, take your well-reddened mold & place it
in this pit of sand. Cover immediately the opening of your mold
in order that no ash & dust enters inside, & then
enclose it with sand up to the edge of the gate & the vents. This done,
uncover your mold & throw on top of your well-melted
silver, the size of a pea or thereabouts, some
of this metallic grain, which will immediately spread through
all your silver & make it boil & turn. Cast as soon as
you have put in this substance, for it is this that is the secret to
making the silver run, since its crust heats it & clarifies
it. You can cast silver finer than the alloy from the capital
and like that of the real, but you must add this
grain in.





With all of this, do not let yourself forget to put, before all things,
a little borax in the melted silver, for even though
goldsmiths do not put any in, nevertheless it is good, and I have
seen it practiced well. Next, one puts in the crust of the substance at
two different times & then the metallic thing. Then make sure [illegible] that
it be placed at the end of your forge.





If you want to blow the ash that is around your mold when
you hold it between the pincers, hold it with the opening at
the bottom, & blow.





When silver is well melted, you can uncover it and blow with the
small bellows, not continually like with gold, but only
to cast out the charcoals in order to put in the substances that
make it run.
