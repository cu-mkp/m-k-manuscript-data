They do not have the invention for making a perfect red in a work
which one needs to reheat. Nonetheless, try the red from Germany, 
which is rouge dâ€™escaille. They make their common red with sanguine, 
looking-glass tin, rocaille, 
litharge & a little iron scales. The
said red is applied on one side & the other of the glass in order
that it has more color; if it were applied on one side only, it would be too
pale orange.
