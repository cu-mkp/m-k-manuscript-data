Rock &amp; grotto

One needs to pestle white &amp; yellow marcasites &amp;

diverse kinds of minerals, &amp; then wash them well, in

order that the earthy &amp; powdery part is cleaned &amp; there remains

only the lustrous grain of the mineral, with which you will

sprinkle your rock previously covered with strong glue, 

if your fatty grotto is

r not for a fountain &amp; for touching

water, and you will have a nice work.
