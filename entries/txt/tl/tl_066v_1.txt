For preventing teats from swelling 
    d or to diminish overly large ones

Take large loaves of bread freshly drawn from the
oven &amp; split them in half &amp;, as hot as may
be done, apply them &amp; they &amp; do this 3 times a
day &amp; continue 4 or 5 days.
Next, make a plaster with Venice turpentine or better,
common turpentine. Mix in sumac,
blackthorn sloes, quince seeds,
pomegranate flowers, olive tree leaves,
&amp; the like, decocted, &amp; mix with the turpentine. But, I
forgot, one needs, after having applied the hot bread, which
softens &amp; makes one sweat, to put on linen cloths soaked with water
from a honey bee hive, that is to say honey &amp;
wax extracted all together from the honeycomb.
