Animal after release

If, by chance, you gave your snake such a writhing shape

that the place of the belly cannot easily come out, especially

since the head &amp; the tail, which are the two ends, are

thinner, cut everything which is outside, &amp; reheat the

mold so well that what remained inside burns, then pass some

quicksilver inside, &amp; attracting ce qui

the ashes &amp; the burnt bones from the inside, it will

also come out, because the conduit is big, &amp; thus will not sour at

all your material. You can pull really strongly the molded

snake, because it is soft &amp; malleable &amp; obedient, &amp;

the mold, having set, is so firm that, because of this, the

imprint will not be spoiled.
