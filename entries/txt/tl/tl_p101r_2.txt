Salt for melting

Mix saltpeter & common salt, and melt them together,
& cast on melted copper or ch in a
bath, & it purifies & makes it run marvellously. First,
one ought to decrepitate the common salt, that is to say
holding it over a good fire until it no longer crackles or, to melt it
better, in a four Ã  vent. And cast it neatly on
marble, then pestle it & grind it very finely, then
put it in a crucible on as much saltpeter &
let it boil, & mix them together until





It cleans & purifies metal well.











the crucible will be red. Next, cast it on
marble, and you will have a substance white, hard &
even, like alabaster, with which you will be able to cast medals
which will resemble marble, but keep them out of the
humidity.
