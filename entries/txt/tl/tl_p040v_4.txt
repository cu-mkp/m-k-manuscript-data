Aquafortis

If your retort is well luted, you ought not to surround it
with ashes, which would only get in the way of chasing
the spirits properly. But when, at the end, you give it violent
fire, surround it with chacoals which should be lit elsewhere beforehand,
as those in the furnace should be, in order that they do not
crackle & do not make smoke. Put the said lit charcoals around the body
of the retort, & not close to the neck, which does not need
to be heated as vigorously. The top grate, where you set your
retort, is sufficiently far, one dour or
half a foot, from the bottom grate where the
charcoal is placed, for by doing this not as much of it is
wasted.
