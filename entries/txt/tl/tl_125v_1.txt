Vipers and snakes

I molded a viper, which, for casting, is more appropriate than

any other snake because it has scales beautiful &amp; very

visible on all the body &amp; principally on the head and under the

throat. It has a flat head, the snout reddish, tending toward

incarnadine, &amp; snubbed like the horned asp or like

un the top of a pig's snout, big jowls, the

eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open, where it

has double canine teeth on each side, all coming out of a

strip of flesh that covers and clothes them. It also has, in the throat,

a tube of flesh, made like a dogâ€™s penis, from which comes its

stinger. Other snakes have a double row of teeth.

If you want cut the to mold the snakes

with the mouth open, you must cut off the head &amp; leave it inside, for

it will not be released.
