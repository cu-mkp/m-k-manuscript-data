For casting in silver

You need to arrange your animals as said and compose the same sand
<-two parts d-> out of 4 parts of
plaster, of two parts reheated brick, & one
part reheated feather alum, and mix
it well. Then, having been prepared thus, and you wishing to mold it,
take the three parts of an earthenware bowl, from which
the peasants eat their soup, of the aforesaid
sand, & add to it pure feather alum,
reheated & pulverized in the mortar, as much as you
can take with 4 fingers and the thumb, or a
small double handful. Then, mix [<-mix->] well & wet
with a little sal ammoniac & the rest of the common
water, + & stir it with your spatula so
that it all becomes like a thick sauce or thin
mustard, & having rubbed the animal with eau-de-vie with the
paintbrush, cast, &
blow, and beat the table to shake the mold, & do as
with others.

Do not forget to put in it crocum, for it prevents
the molds from cracking & is appropriate for all
metals.



Alloyed silver is better for casting than the fine one, provided
that it is sweet.



One needs the feather alum to be well pulverized
and well mixed.



Sal ammoniac is a friend of gold & of
silver.





which needs to be placed before the sand in the bowl,
which is put in the water, & not the water in the
sand



Latten is the enemy of gold & the friend of
silver.
