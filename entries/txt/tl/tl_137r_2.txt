Huile tingente to make metals run

Take some â˜¿ sublimate of Venice,
true &amp; not arsenic sublimate, a pea, aes
ustum, a pea, sal ammoniac, a pea.
Pulverize everything separately, &amp; next mix everything in a
glass bottle &amp; put on hot ash. You will see
that everything dissolves like wax, making many colors. Let it
everything set &amp; put a little of it on each
melted metal, &amp; it will run marvelously.




Founders of large casts for statues throw in much
tartar to clean it of its filth &amp; nastiness,
&amp; much sal ammoniac to render it thin &amp; neat. And when
they want to cast, they put in much tin. The cold &amp;
humidity strongly disagrees with it, which renders dangerous the
work of the founder, for one only needs a spring of
water in the pit to lose everything.
