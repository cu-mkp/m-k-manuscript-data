Excellent sand

Alabaster calcined in a crucible over

charcoal fire, so that, touching it, it turns into powder. Once

cold, pulverize it finely &amp; pass it through a double sieve

&amp; render it as if impalpable. And d with one

lb of alabaster, one needs one

â„¥ of sal ammoniac. Mix well &amp;

incorporate everything together, then put them in a

cellar cellar or a damp

place. And with this paste, mold what you will need, &amp; next

dry the mold in the fire, &amp; cast whichever metal you wish, while

the sand is hot; &amp; you will cast as neatly as the principal, &amp;

the sand can still be used by placing it in a damp place

&amp; drying it in the fire.
