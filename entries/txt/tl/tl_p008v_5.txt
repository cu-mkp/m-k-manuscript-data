 Perfect amalgam
 
  Take the most delicate
  


     grais
    




  you can & hollow it in
the middle. Put in an
  
   eighth part
  
  of
  
   ☿
  
  ,
  
   in
  
  & into this, while adding
  
   water
  
  , rub & wear down your
  
   ☾
  
  or
  
   ☼
  
  until the
substance becomes like paste & even harder. Next, if you want, eat
it away with good
  
   aquafortis
  
  , if it is
  
   ☾
  
  or
  
   ♀
  
  . Then remelt it,
having taken it out as you know. The
  
   ☾
  
  will have a
tint and, once melted, will leave some grains of
  
   ☼
  
  , & the
  
   ♀
  
  will be
very beautiful & will have almost no crust.
