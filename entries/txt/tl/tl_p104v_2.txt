For casting

If you have some piece which will not release & is big,
mold it with wax, either in hollow or in relief, because it is
malleable once soft & obeys, and thus separates itself from the
piece without leaving anything. But take heed that the melted wax
be neither too hot nor too cold. Some mold with wax heated in
hot water, but in pressing, the mold becomes clumsy 
& makes itself false. When you have the hollow wax form, you can cast in some
very soft clay & thoroughly moistened & clear, & let it dry
at ease. Then you will make a hollow form on it ave of
lead or tin, in you which what you will
form will be of good release.
