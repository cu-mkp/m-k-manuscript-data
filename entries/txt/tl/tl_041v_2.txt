Sheared ewes

If the shearer sometimes wounds them, he puts

 the very dung of the ewe on top. When they

are fat, they are easier to shear &amp; do not get wounded so easily.

If the shearer wants to

viscorter them, that is to

say castrate, when they are one or two years old, he

must not have been with his wife for this would make the sheep

die.
