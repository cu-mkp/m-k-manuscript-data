Dust keeps wheat from becoming infested with weevils. And to clean
it well when it is stained &amp; as if rusty, pass ashes through
the sieve &amp; mix them with the wheat, then
boult the whole with a boulting cloth of rough cloth or
canvas. The ashes will pass through &amp; your
wheat will stay yellow, clean &amp; very
beautiful.
