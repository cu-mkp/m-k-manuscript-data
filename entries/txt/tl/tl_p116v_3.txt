Cast for copper and latten

For red copper, one needs to put sal ammoniac, which
cleans & purges it of all its crust when it is well melted. There
are some who put in pieces of old leather thick new
leather. Others, parings of the feet of field mice.
Others, melted common salt alone, or melted with saltpeter.
The principal is sal ammoniac & a little fine tin, as
to what you want to cast. Red copper is more troublesome to melt
M than latten. But when it is well melted, it runs
better, especially if it is alloyed with a with latten.
Latten alloys with a quarter of copper, and
one puts it in like in copper. But
particularly, a little calamine makes it run well.
