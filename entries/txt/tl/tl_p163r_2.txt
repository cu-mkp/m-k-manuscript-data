Eau-de-vie

It is excellent for molding neatly, such that in the place where you
do not put any, the sand will usually attach to the figure. But it needs to
be in three passes. And because it does not take easily on oiled
things, I believe that it would be good to put some amongst the
water in which you temper your sand.
