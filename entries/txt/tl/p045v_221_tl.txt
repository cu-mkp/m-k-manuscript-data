Loading an arquebus

You ought to have different charges according to the range that you
want to give to your arquebus, all of which should have a screw
on the end that fits in the nut of the ramrod of the
said arquebus. Thus, when you have put the powder in the charge,
which is in the nut, hold the ramrod upright. And
raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the
charge is at the bottom of the arquebus, then right the arquebus, the
mouth of the barrel up, and remove the little ramrod. Thus your
powder will be entirely in the breech without any of its grain or
dust attaching to the sides of the arquebus, which always has some filth
in the 
. Thus it will not push back, and you will shoot more
true.
