Black varnish without fire, without disassembling the

harnesses or removing the bands from

trunks

Take varnish of spike lavender oil &amp; mix in

soot black or lampblack, &amp; without fire it will mix in

by itself. Varnish with a brush &amp; it will soon be

dry. Turpentine varnish will be quite good, but it does not dry

as soon.
