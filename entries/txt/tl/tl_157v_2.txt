Molding a bird

One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side

on a clay slab, and hide &amp; sink within it half the

said bird, in order that it only shows one leg

&amp; one foot, then you will anoint it with butter to make it

hold the feathers down, finally of oil

eau-de-vie. And then cast. And being set, clean &amp;

uncover whatever needs it. Next, mold the other side in the same way. But

because the feet, being of bone that is difficult to burn &amp; which

are not able to be cleaned neither by quicksilver

If nor by any other means, if the mold would not

open, uncover the bottom of the feet &amp; the toe or the little finger

of the claw, &amp; mold as a separate piece. Reheat &amp; open your

mold &amp; clean the bones. The feet usually remain too

weak to support the mass of a solid bird. And for this reason,

one adapts an iron wire in the mold of the

feet which passes into the body before casting; thus, they are

reinforced. Some mold the wings in a frame. Others mold the

head &amp; the said wings separately en noyau, then join &amp;

repair them to first model a form that will be stiff &amp; withstand the tempered sand.

They are skinned &amp; filled with cotton cloth. &amp;

even better, one needs to dress them in the fashion that curriers

do, in order that they do not lose a feather, weight. The

dressing is alum &amp; paste of flour.
