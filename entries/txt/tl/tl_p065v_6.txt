        
From nature
        

There are some who paint from nature on oiled paper, &
if they do not finish in one go, they put their paper &
unfinished picture in water so that it shall not dry.
               

    
   

        
Illuminators painting on paper temper their colors
with gum & mix in a little soap to make them run
better.
    

        
        
Painters must all learn how to depict after nature, for to them
it is travel provisions & revenue & sure means of earning their
passage when travelling across the lands with only their
cocon.
