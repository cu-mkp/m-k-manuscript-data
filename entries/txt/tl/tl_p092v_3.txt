 Mixture
 

   Fine tin
  
  ,
  
   congealed mercury
  
  with the smell of
  
   tin
  
  ,
  
   looking-glass tin
  
  ,
  
   fine lead
  
  ,
  
   as much of
one as the other
  
  , makes a substance that melts very promptly but is
breakable & white. I think that it would be good for
  
   solder
  
  .
A long time to cool.
