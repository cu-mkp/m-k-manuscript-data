Calandra larks & all
birds taken from the nest & which have not had freedom are
better, for these which are taken by net never sing so well. However,
the wild ones give <-[illegible]-> much pleasure with their
chanting, but they ought be taken before St. Michael,
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call gaillardise,
which makes them sick & sometimes makes them die, especially
calandra larks. One knows this when they are sad & do not sing.
One must pierce it <-av->, not with a pin, but
very gently by turning with the tip of quite pointy feather.
The calandra lark does not want to be without <-grey->
river sand, & the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself in it
& purges itself with it.
