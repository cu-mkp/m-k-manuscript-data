Keeping fruit for the entire year

â„ž a glass ampul with an opening capable of
receiving cherries and plums or whatever fruit that
you want. Put in some hot water for the space of two
hours. And when your water is cooled, throw it out &
turn the opening upside down on a quite even <-&->
table, & in a room where there is not a drop of air &
of wind. Then <-en-> prepare a stopper of new
wax, wrapped in waxed canvas, and adjust it to the
ampul quite precisely in order that it will be all ready to
stop it when you will have put in the fruit. And when you will have
delicately picked with your hand the fruit without it
being corrupted & on a warm & dry day, return to the
well-closed room, where neither wind nor air may enter,
& put it gently & with dexterity in the bottle. Then
stop the bottle well with the stopper & lute it
& making the lute if it seems good with some quicklime &
oil, & such that no water may enter in. Then put your
bottles in a vat full of water during the
summer <-And in the winter because the cellar s-> in
a cellar, and in the winter put your bottles
into a basket furnished with some weights & lower
it to the bottom of a deep well. For in the winter
the water of the vat would be too cold if the cellar
is not quite warm, for one needs the water to be like river
water.
