Bellows

To melt with bellows, & hasten your melt,
& also cast hotter po, do not place your
bellows at the bottom near the foot of the furnace,
for fear that some charcoal might you enter it, put
them almost under the grate. It is good that your
four Ã  vent be in an aerated place so that the
wind might make it heat better, & that it be well dry,
& reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the furnace
& that there is only the entry of the blast-pipe of the
bellows. And by the end, you need to give it force,
as at the beginning you will blow gently.
