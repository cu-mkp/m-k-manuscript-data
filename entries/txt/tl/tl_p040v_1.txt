 Cross of the
 
  commanders of
  
   Malta
  


  This beautiful
  
   rouge clair
  
  which makes the field of
the white
  
   enamel
  
  cross is
  
   blood
  
  of fine tear of
  

    dragon
   
   â€™s blood
  
  tempered with
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  or else
  

    Indian
   

    laque platte
   

  , which in my opinion is made
in
  
   Flanders
  
  , tempered with
  
   clear turpentine
  
  & tear
of
  
   mastic
  
  & laid down on a
  
   silver
  
  leaf, not the kind
which the
  
   painters
  
  use, but a thicker kind, which is
burnished by
  
   those who make
   
    gemstone foils
   



    Av
   

  or by
  
   goldsmiths
  
  , & that gives it
this beautiful brilliance.
