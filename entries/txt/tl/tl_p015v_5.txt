  Ears
 

  When some
  
   defluxion
  


  occurs there, one needs
to be very careful not to put anything inside, and according to the
proverb,
  


   one ought only to touch the
   
    ear
   
   & the
   
    eye
   
   with the
   
    elbow
   

  . However, it
is good to put on an affected
  
   ear
  

   musked cotton
  
  , that is
to say, kept in
  
   musk
  
  , for it
  
   comforts quite well
  
  .
