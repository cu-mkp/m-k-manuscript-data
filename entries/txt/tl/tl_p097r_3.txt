 Gilding with
 
  silver
 

  One needs to prepare the
  
   guards
  
  & whiten them with a
  

    li
   




   file
  
  , a little coarser
  
   for
  
  than for
  
   gold
  
  . And one makes them pass beyond
grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
  
   silver foil
  
  , then separate it with a
  
   knife
  
  ; next, apply
it to the
  
   guard
  
  with
  
   a small
  

   tweezers
  
  & a small
  
   burnisher
  
  . And then, reheat & apply until they
are all gilt with
  
   silver
  
  . Next, one needs to cover them for the
third time with the doubled
  
   foil
  
  , as has been said, then burnish them
very well & with force, not with the
  
   bloodstone
  
  but with a
strong
  
   burnisher
  
  . Just as the
  
   burnisher
  
  ought not to
burnish
  
   gold
  
  .
