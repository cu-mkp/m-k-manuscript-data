Take in the month of June &amp; July, a number

of the largest snails you can, with their shell, put them in a

glass bottle with a sufficient quantity of very hard

&amp; thoroughly boiled egg yolks with good vinegar.

Stopper the whole well &amp; put it under horsedung for

the space of fifteen days. The snails will

first live on the egg yolks, then with the heat they will come

out of their shells &amp; eat &amp; live on those. Finally, a white

ointment is made with it, which, without cutting open the bottle

you mec, which above all for your safety you

b will always keep well stoppered, you will put

in the very strong sun &amp; in the serain for the

space

of fifteen days. Next you will

break it from quite far away &amp; with a long stick without

looking at it &amp; having plugged yourself up well, you will put some of it where you

want, or rub some of it on a stake in a running river or a tree or

a plant that is on the bank.
