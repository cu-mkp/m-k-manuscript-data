IlNightingale -

One needs for the cage, made like those for larks
like a barn & lined with green fabric, to be
made with a drawer underneath, to refresh its fresh earth
everyday, for it takes much delight in this, & mix in it
some ants. You can carry an anthill with its earth
in a barrel full of earth, & keep them there & they
will lay their eggs there, in order to always have some at hand when you
want them, should you take pleasure in feeding nightingales.
When you have taken it, it is fat & full, & thus, to keep it in
its strength, one needs to, for the first day,
take uy it in the
hand & open its beak & put in its beak with a
small pointed stick some mutton heart or other
delicate flesh, chopped up not too finely, in order to fill its
belly & keep it from diminishing & growing leaner, until it
has gotten over its fancy. The next day you will give
him And you will feed it in this way three or four times a
day & will also make it drink. The next
morning, you will give it in its cage some well-minced
flesh with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and change it two or three
times a day, for it will not eat it if it is
hardened & if it is not fresh. And if it goes half a
day without eating, one needs to feed it as before &
do so until it








eats by itself. And to entice it better, you could add amongst the
meat & the egg some live mealworms, for it is
very fond of them.
