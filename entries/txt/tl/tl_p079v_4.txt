Mixture for printers

Make a layer of pulverized antimony, & a layer
of latten & old scrapings or thin plates of iron or
clo iron nail heads, and continue in this way
until the crucible is full. And melt inside a four Ã 
vent, & then mix a little tin & fill up the
crucible with lead until it causes it. And
increase the fire & mix to make the substances alloy well. The
mixture for large letters is harder.
