Sheath maker

Sheath makers use small, very delicate skins of

lambs and young goats, almost like

parchment and keep them constantly re-moistened in humid

places. When they want to imprint some history, they layer them in

the hollows of their figure, then put over the top fine fatty

earth with which cloths are rid of grease, having pressed &amp; beaten

it well &amp; rendered it moderately humid and soft. Then they put on

the earth a small even board and put the whole in a

press and let it dry there. After the

earth, only the leather remains neatly imprinted  of

the size of a pea. And then you give the

leather two or three layers of copperas black and

iron scale, one after the other, as even as the

tanners do. And this dye, being astringent, makes the

leather shrink &amp; strengthens it and makes it imprint better.

Once dry, one glues canvas on the back with strong glue. 

In this manner one can promptly imitate big statues &amp;

very subtle medals and paint &amp;

decorate them &amp; are light and portable

&amp; last a long time. That which is imprinted on a relief

is done differently and can be retraced with a hot

iron.
