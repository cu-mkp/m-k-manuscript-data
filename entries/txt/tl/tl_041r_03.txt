Sand

The sand cast for casting should be chosen neither so

lean that it has no hold, nor too fatty. And although it is found

in nature, it is nonetheless not everywhere. And if you

are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with

fatty earth, for the sand does not want it at all, for it makes

it very porous. But you can give it bond with brick thoroughly

ground on marble, or plaster or calcined

alabaster or something similar, or the burned marrow of

ox horn or burned aspalte throughout. If you grind it quite

finely on porphyry, it s acquires

hold &amp; then you can burn it with aspalte or mix

it with a quarter part of tripoli. Guard against

bread falling into your sand because it makes it very

porous.

Try mixing in soot black.
