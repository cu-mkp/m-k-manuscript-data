Gold color

To quickly make a layer of or <-on->
mat on canvas or other oil panel, one makes fatty
walnut oil in the sun or on the
fire, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way,
although there is neither lead nor ceruse. And with this,
grind massicot, minium & other desiccatives,
not verdet nor orpiment, for they cause the
gold to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the
weather is not serain & dry, do not smooth it,
for if the weather is musty & humid, it would
turn black.
