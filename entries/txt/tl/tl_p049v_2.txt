Take a <-pierced-> playing card, pierced with a
pin or needle, folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small cleft stick and, holding the said
stick by <-one end-> the other end,
put your card three or 4 fingers away from
the water that you will have put in a dish or similar
vessel. Then pour your lead, which should not be too
hot, into the card & continually tap on the stick
that holds it. And thus your lead will granulate itself roundly.
And pass it through a coarse sieve to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The largeish one will reach 25 to 30 paces.
