Tempering of balls for piercing armor of
proof

Heat the lead ball as much as you can without melting it, and
when it will be very hot, temper it in the
strongest vinegar that you can. And do this four or five times.
Next, chop some lard very small & some linen also very
finely, mix all together & use it as wadding, and by a little force
& very precisely, force it into the arquebus or pistol. And
before firing, cha if possible, make it so that
the ball is hot.
