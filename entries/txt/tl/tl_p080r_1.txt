Petard

They make them of fine substance & fine copper, which is
capable of fifty lb of powder, in the shape of a
reinforced firkin, and having made a hole even <-of->
with the ground at the foot of a wall with gimlets,
they set the said loaded petard in that hole, with the muzzle pointing
up, which makes a large breach.
