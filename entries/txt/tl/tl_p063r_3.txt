 Casting
 
  The
  
   Germans
  
  use
  
   lead from
   
    Flanders
   

  because
it is very soft. And to cast better they take
  
   lead ore
  
  & melt
it, & separate what is melted from the
  
   filth
  
  &
  
   ore
  
  , & pour it into a separate
  
   vessel
  
  , then
  
   the
bottom
  
  they make their cast with it. For the
  
   lead
  
  must not have been
put to work before, but rather completely new. Some cast into
  
   molds
of
   
    iron
   
   &
   
    copper
   

  .
 

  or new
  
   lead
  
  coming from the
  
   mine
  
  . They melt it twice
in a
  
   crucible
  
  . In the first one, they purge it of
  
   filth
  
  . In the second, they
  

    en
   

  make the cast.
