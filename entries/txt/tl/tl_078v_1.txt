For making bronze in the color of steel

Take glass alum &amp; antimony, but one

needs twice as much glass alum as

antimony, and pestle the whole together in an iron

mortar, &amp; then mix with gum water while grinding it on

marble, &amp; then one needs to use it with a

paintbrush, &amp; next let it dry, and then polish it

with a tooth of a wolf or dog.
