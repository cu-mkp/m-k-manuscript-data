    Painting on glass

For blue, they take the coarsest azur d’esmail & grind it
on shale, & mix in two or three rosary
beads’ worth of rocaille or more, according to the
quantity of the work. And having done their drawing with noir
d’escaille (which is painted toward the light with the piece
of glass upright), they lay all their pieces on white
paper <-when-> for knowing by the whiteness of the
paper the lighting of their histories and <-as->
set down all colors which are of one kind all in one go. Then they heat
it up.
