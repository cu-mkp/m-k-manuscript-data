 Vitrified
 
  saltpeter
 

  Being melted with
  
   pebbles
  
  , it makes the
  
   glass
  
  very white.
But before, one needs to calcine it on a
  
   hot tile or shovel
  
  . And that which will remain from the vapor, mix it with
  
   as
much of the
   
    white calcined pebbles
   

  . It is true that, in the
  
   little furnace
  
  , it does not clarify well. But for
  
   large panes of
glass
  
  , it makes the
  
   glass
  
  very clear & white &
clean.
