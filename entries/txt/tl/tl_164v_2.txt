Sand

If there is not enough good feather alum or

crocum, it will easily crack in the fire. But if it is

mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. It is recognized to be

good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes water

when one quenches it &amp; rends breaks

easily because the alum &amp; the crocum render

it spongy. On the contrary, bad sand, which is only of plaster &amp;

brick, &amp; little mixed with alum, breaks easily in the

fire &amp; hardens in water. Cast, if possible, all in one

go.
