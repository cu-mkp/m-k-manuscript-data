Mixture of tin and lead

For delicate plants & other flowers or thin foliage, the fine
tin ought to exceed the lead more than three parts.
And if it is a thick & coarse material, the lead ought to
exceed by more than three parts. Heat the mostly tin
mixture until it is almost red & very hot. And when you want to
cast, in removing your crucible from the fire, throw in two or
three grains of rosin, & for one lb & a half
or two of lead or tin, put with the rosin as
much looking-glass tin as the size of a hazelnut
with its shell, & mix & cast. And make sure that there is
more of the metal than is needed, in order that some is left.
However, if there is not enough, finish casting, & it will take. But
it will not be so neat. Next, dip your mold into water,
& with a point, release it carefully so that nothing is
spoiled. Make your cast a bit longer. If the material is very
thin, one needs for it to be almost all tin.




If you mold de plu want to cast in lead or
tin en noyau in the aforesaid sand, reheat your
mold once, only if there is nothing to burn inside. But if it
is for plants, flowers, & animals to be burnt, one needs to reheat it
two times, however not as much the second time for lead &
tin as for silver & gold. For for these, they
ought to be red when you cast, but for lead and tin, let
it cool until you can hold the tip of your
finger in the gate without burning yourself,
but you find a lukewarm heat.
