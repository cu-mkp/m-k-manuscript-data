<-d-> or to diminish overly large ones
        
Take large loaves of bread freshly drawn from the
oven & split them in half &, as hot as may
be done, apply them <-& they-> & do this 3 times a
day, & continue 4 or 5 days.
Next, make a plaster with Venice turpentine or better,
common turpentine. Mix in sumac,
blackthorn sloes, quince seeds,
pomegranate flowers, olive tree leaves,
& the like, decocted, & mix with the turpentine. But, I
forgot, one needs, after having applied the hot bread, which
softens & makes one sweat, to put on linen cloths soaked with water
from a honey bee hive, that is to say honey &
wax extracted all together from the honeycomb.
