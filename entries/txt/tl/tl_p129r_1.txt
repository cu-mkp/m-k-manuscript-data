 Painting plants of
 
  metal
 

  If you are in a hurry, it would be better to mix your color with a
not-too-thick
  
   gum
  

   or
  
  because
  
   oil
  
  takes a
  
   long time
  
  to dry and runs if it is layered thinly,
as the plants require. And if you still want it
  
   done
  
  promptly,
temper your color with
  
   glair
  
  beaten with
  
   peelings of the
   
    fig tree
   

  , 
and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
thinly.
