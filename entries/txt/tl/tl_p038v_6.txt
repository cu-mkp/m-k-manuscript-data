Scarlets

Because one aulne costs seven or eight
lb to dye, they use cloths worth seven or eight
francs an aulne. But whoever wants something
beautiful se la should buy white cloth worth
fifteen francs an aulne & have it dyed with
pure scarlet pastel woad & a little cochineal.
Black cloth is thin so that the dyeing is
inexpensive.
