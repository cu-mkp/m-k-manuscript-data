Cutting lead

Because it is fatty & grips & sticks to the knife or
chisel, wet it & you will cut it like glass.




Sometimes gold & silver take on, through certain fumes,
some color during the casting. But these are not at all scales &
crust, but rather this color goes away with whitening
& bullitoire.
