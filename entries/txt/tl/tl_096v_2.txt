Color of water

For the color of water, one passes a soft file

on the guards to whiten them, then the burnisher. Next, one

makes them pass to blue until they turn grey. Next, when they are still

moderately hot, one passes the bloodstone over them, and when

they cool, one turns them to reheat them, for the color of water is made

only in several passes. And if the guards were not warm, the

bloodstone would scrape &amp; undo the color. One needs to take

heed that the guards do not pass too far beyond grey, for they would throw

off filth that would prevent the color from taking. One needs almost one

day for preparing, softening &amp; setting the

color of water, but as they pass a little beyond blue, it is enough for

grey &amp; another color. Grey is the lesser color after varnish,

which is of two colors, either yellow or black.
