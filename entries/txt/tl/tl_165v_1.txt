Stance of animals

Not only with iron points but with melted

wax, animals are secured on the earthen slab.

Wash them first in clear water, once they have died in the mixture of

vinegar &amp; urine, &amp; with a sponge

purge their mouth, eyes, and head of the slaver which comes out,

for the sand would never set well there and would become

lumpy.

If you want to make them keep their mouths open, put in a little bit of

spinet string, which will not take up space.
