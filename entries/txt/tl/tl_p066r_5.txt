The Flemish give a layer of distemper glue 
on the molding, then mix lamp black or
soot black with the same glue & let dry.
Next they pounce some moresque in the corners & paint it
with minium, massicot, & ocre de ru,
and a little yellow ocher, tempered with fatty oil
in which they clean their paintbrushes for oil,
because the three aforesaid colors are gripping & dry immediately.
Next they lay down the gold, then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
oil, but it would not be good because the gold would
attach itself everywhere & not only to the moresque. Go
back to the top to *

To make or mat beautiful, put in a little varnish
or fatty oil, not from that which is made from the cleaning of
paintbrushes, but the pure, which is made fatty in
the sun or mixed with ceruse.




Or mat of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than
es burnished gold, and lasts
longer in the rain & besides, & is made sooner.
Burnished gold cracks over time & comes off
in the rain.
