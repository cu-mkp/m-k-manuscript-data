To make or mat beautiful, put in a little varnish
or fatty oil, not from that which is made from the cleaning of
paintbrushes, but the pure, which is made fatty in
the sun or mixed with ceruse.




Or mat of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than
<-es-> burnished gold, and lasts
longer in the rain & besides, & is made sooner.
Burnished gold cracks over time & comes off
in the rain.
