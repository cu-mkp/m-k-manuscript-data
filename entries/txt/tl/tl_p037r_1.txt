The metal whitens the more it is melted, because the
tin does not go away but rather mixes in more. And, by holding it
a long time in the fire, the filth is eaten away, which is what 
makes it brittle. If you want to chase the tin from the
copper, after it is quite hot, throw in saltpeter often.
This only & not the fire separates it, & purifies it, & eats
the filth. The metal is cast very neatly. The
copper is prone to swell, but because it is soft, it can be fixed
with a hammer.
