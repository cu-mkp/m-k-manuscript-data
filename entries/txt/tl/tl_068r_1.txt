Fanciful tables

You can make various grooved compartments &amp; in these, put

fishes painted from nature &amp; with colors on simple

carton, &amp; if you please, on silvered &amp;

burnished paper which will represent the scales. And next,

cover this with very clear lantern horn. You can apply the same

to other works.
