Molding a single spider

One needs to plant it on the clay slab, as has been

said, on a vine leaf, and make there your first cast; &amp; once

it has set, uncover the spider up to half its legs, then make the

second cast.

In order The hairy feet of large

spiders, like any animal hair, does not mold well if it is not

flattened, having anointed it with wheat oil, which

stiffens it &amp; is quickly dry. Hairy things mix with the sand &amp;

do not burn well.
