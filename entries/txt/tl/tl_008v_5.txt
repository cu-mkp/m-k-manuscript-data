Perfect amalgam

Take the most delicate grais you can &amp; hollow it in

the middle. Put in an eighth part of ☿,

in &amp; into this, while adding water, rub &amp; wear down your

☾ or ☼ until the

substance becomes like paste &amp; even harder. Next, if you want, eat

it away with good aquafortis, if it is

☾ or ♀. Then remelt it,

having taken it out as you know. The ☾ will have a

tint and, once melted, will leave some grains of

☼, &amp; the ♀ will be

very beautiful &amp; will have almost no crust.
