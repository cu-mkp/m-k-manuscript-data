 For supporting a
 
  bucket
 
 of
 
  water
 
 on the tips of three
 
  knives
 
 laid down without touching the ground
 


  According to the strength of your
  
   knives, either
   
    kitchen
   
   or table
  
  , you will make them support a large
weight on their tips laid down & arranged in a triangle, edge to
edge, as you can see, & they would not touch the ground. And if,
after arranging them this way, you turn them the other way without
unjoining them, the tips of the handles can also support a large weight
without touching the ground. You can easily adapt this to another
use with
  
   pikes, with joists
  
  , or to promptly make a tripod in a
camp with three
  
   halberd points
  
  . If the edge of the
  
   knife
  
  marked A faces from right to left, the butts of the
handles will rise, but if the edge of the same
  
   knife
  
  faces from
left to right, the tips will rise.
