Leady silver



It degrades a lot, because the lead which is mixed in works it
like in the cupel, and makes it jump in little balls at the
edges of the crucible & on the charcoal which
covers it. It is also fatty, and thus it is good to melt all coined
silver, like reals & others, & to put it in ingots
before melting it for casting lizards & animals, for it
comes out better. I molded some as neat as the principal, such as a
little viper of silver, and I made the alloy out of 4
reals, of 20 sous from
Spain, & a coin of xx
sous from France.
