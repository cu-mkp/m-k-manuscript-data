  Varnish
 
 resistant to
 
  water
 



    Flanders
   
   varnish
  
  , made with
  
   turpentine
  
  &
  
   oil of turpentine or mastic
  
  , can come off and does not
hold up
  
   in the rain
  
  . But that made with
  
   white walnut oil
  
  ,
  

  as you have done, holds
  
   in the rain
  

   and
  
  is
very clear & beautiful & dries soon. This is why one uses this
one for painted banners & signs that one carries
  
   in the
rain
  
  .
