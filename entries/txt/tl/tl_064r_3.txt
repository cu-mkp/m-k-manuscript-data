Vermilion

One ought not to keep it in water when tempered

ground with oil for it loses its color. It is better

to choose whitish vermilion than dark &amp; blackish. For

vermilion is commonly mixed with a little lake, without

which it would hardly be different from minium. But the pale 

casts more vivacity than the dark. It is not desiccative, &amp;

for this reason one mixes in calcined cristallin.
