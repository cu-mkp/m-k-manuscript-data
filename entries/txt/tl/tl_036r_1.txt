For transmuting a ball into a thimble,

cunning

    

of leather

Make a small sheath of plain leather, such as cow or

morocco, somewhat thick, as tall as three

fingers, sewn like the finger of a glove &amp; large

enough that two fingertips can fit inside &amp; which, at

the tip, which is a little puckered, has a round hole as large as a

double liard. Take one two similar

boxwood balls, &amp; let one be hollow &amp;

open with a round hole on one side only so that the thimble can

fit inside. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your

leather sheath on the table with the

ball that is not hollow. Pass a stick inside the

leather sheath to show that there is nothing there, also

show the full ball, and hold the one which is hollow &amp; has

the thimble inside it by your little finger &amp; ring

finger, and do this with your right hand

with which you are holding the stick. Next, you take your

leather sheath &amp; place it over the hollow

ball which is in your fingers, &amp; making it seem as

if you are putting some oribus powder over it, you put

back the leather mold that

contains the ball with the thimble on the

table, then you take the round &amp; solid ball

remaining on the table, and command it to enter from under the

table into the leather sheath. Then, when lifting

the leather, the ball seems to be the same,

although it is the hollow one. Then you cover it again &amp; command it to

become invisible. And then, lifting the sheath while pressing

it, you will remove it &amp; the ball along with it; &amp;

l putting it aside with the sheath,

&amp; a  in its place will be found a thimble

for the ladies whose bottom hurts, that is to say, the bottom of the

needle.
