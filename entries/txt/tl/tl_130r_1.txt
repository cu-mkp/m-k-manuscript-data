wide. Then with iron points one attaches their feet to a

small board, giving them the fitting attitude &amp; gait. Once

as one wants, securing it with some tool. Then one finishes drying it in

an oven when the bread is drawn. Next, one places in the

hollow of the eyes balls of lead or of wax, painted
