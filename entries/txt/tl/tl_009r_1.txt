Plowman

Because millet is by nature very dry,

harvesters beat it most often at night in the cool

&amp; by moonlight. Which could not be done with another

grain that is wetter, for one le must let the

sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the sun is

approaching midday. Quickly after the millet is

cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats it &amp; makes it lean as

much as if the millet was still standing. The ground

where the millet has been sown diminishes much

in its fertility &amp; c, which one knows

well at the next sowing that one makes after that. But above

all the grain called

    pomole in Gascony or

baillard in France, makes the earth shake seven years later,

according to the common saying. Beans

improve &amp; correct the soil, provided that one lets the roots &amp; stems

rot in it.
