  Spinet
 
 playing by itself
 


  Make an axle surrounded with wheels pierced all around the edge, and
attach
  
   quills
  
  as for a
  
   cittern
  
  or a
  
   spinet
  
  , 
& arrange them according to the song you want to be said, leaving
  
   such
  
  a suitable distance between. And, turning the
axle either by yourself or by a
  
   clock
  
  spring, your invention
will be effected.
