Fine gold 

There is a property of gold which, even though it is very fine

&amp; unalloyed &amp; has been passed through aquafortis &amp;

antimony, is nevertheless so brittle that it hardly withstands the

hammer. And the composition of verdet, described above to

make gold run, makes it as soft as

lead.
