Carcanets made Ã  jour

They are molded like crayfish en noyau, first on
one side, that which is hollow being raised up with clay, &amp; then
one uncovers them from the other side &amp; one makes the second
casting. They can also be cast well in frames, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
wax, or else one fills the cavities that cannot release
with wax or clay.
