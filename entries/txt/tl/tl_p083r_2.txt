Sand for copper medals

â„ž hat felt burnt on a covered
fire, dross of iron, & burnt bone, all of which
ground very finely & pestled & watered with saltwater;
& make a paste of it & mold it, & wipe it over a
straw fire.   These three sands, pulverized and very finely
ground on porphyry, mold well, and I think that
separately each of them is very good. Burnt hat felt molds very
neatly and releases very neatly.



Plaster molds very neatly but it becomes porous. Bone has
scarcely any body unless it has iron dross. Felt makes it
release.
