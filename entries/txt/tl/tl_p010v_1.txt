 For painting in
 
  oil
 
 on
 
  taffeta
 

  without the
  
   oil
  
  running
 

  One needs to make a layer of
  

    batture
   

  , which is made
  
   of well-cooked honey &
   
    turpentine
   

  of
  
   strong glue
  
  soaked for 24
  
   hours
  
  in
  
   water
  
  then gently
brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little
  
   honey
  
  to soften it, & make it boil all together. And on top
of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in
  
   oil
  
  , which will soften the layer even more, and which can also
serve you to make a seat for
  
   gold
  
  .
  
   Alum water
  
  also
keeps
  
   oil
  
  from running.
