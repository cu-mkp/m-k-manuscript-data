Marks from the points of iron wire which are found

on the head of the animal

L With the points, one has previously

set the stance, especially that of the head. But the head being pierced,

there remains around the hole some moisture and a little exudation,

which hinders the sand from covering the point &amp; there

always remains some little opening g. But to avoid

this, you can plant in the slab of earth an

iron point, arro cleaned &amp;

rounded at the top end, &amp; on this end place there a little hard

wax or du a little mastic or

cement and, by means of the hot iron

wire, hold in place the throat of the animal, which can be removed

when you come to uncover the belly &amp; the throat to make the second

cast.
