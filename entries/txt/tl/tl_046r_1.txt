For the teeth, oil of sulfur

Some people whiten them with confections of

aquafortis; however, one says that this corrupts them

afterward &amp; causes a blackness on them. One says that oil of

sulfur is excellent, but one needs to mix it in this way: take as

much clove oil as can be held in a

walnut shell, and as much rose honey,

&amp; seven or eight drops of oil of sulfur, &amp; mix

it well all together. And after having cleaned the teeth with a

small burin, touch them lightly with a end little

cotton dipped in the aforesaid oils and leave it there for a

little while, then spit or rinse your mouth with tepid

water, and reiterate two or three times. Oil of sulfur

penetrates &amp; is corrosive, and the but the

clove oil &amp; the rose honey correct it.

Therefore use it with discretion.
