For firing a schioppo senza rumore

Warm the pipe well & plug the touch-hole below, & take a piece of porkfat, the freshest
that you can, as long as the joint of the little
finger & of the caliber, & put it in the pipe &
move it up and down until it is completely melted. Next, load the pipe
at the top with a socket that is
held on the ramrod, as you know, & it will only make a
little whistle.
