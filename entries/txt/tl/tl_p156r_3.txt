  Chasing
 


   Lead
  
  is so fatty & soft that one cannot strike it boldly,
& one needs to have a
  
   very light hand
  
  . The other
  
   great
metals
  
  are easier. With a
  
   burin
  
  called the
  

    onglet
   

  you make & retrace the more delicate lines,
with the
  
   ordinary engraving burin
  
  the broader ones, and with
the
  

    chaple
   

  you remove the big flashing, and with the
  
   small chisels
  
  you soften the harshness of the lines, you smooth, you
add relief to a line.
