Molding a fly

Large flies can be molded &amp; g made

by casting. But one needs par d to anoint underneath

their wings with wheat oil, which dries quickly and

fortifies them &amp; gives them a little thickness. The same is done to

butterflies, cicadas, grasshoppers &amp;

similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some

leaf or bouquet. The others are made by hand with a very

thin silver sheet. One ought not to keep them once dead,

because they dry out and their legs break.

Wheat oil is put underneath delicate things to render

them more rigid &amp; firm &amp; to make them hold their natural

position. Because being weak &amp; delicate, the tempered sand, weighing down

their tops, would change their form.
