Congealing mercury

It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two

hours in a rather large iron pot,

putting in, for an ℥ of

☿, ii ℥ of

verdet of and vitriol of

saltpeter ana, with sufficient quantity of old

water from farriers.

Or else, melt 4 ℥ of tin, &amp; as

it cools, purify it of its filth, which is on top, then, make a

hole in it &amp; put in this i ℥ of

☿ &amp; it will come out like tin if you

remelt it, but it will be breakable. And if you want to assay if it is

tin or ☿, redden a shovel &amp;

put a small piece of your ingot on top. If it is tin, it will melt

&amp; stay, but if it is ☿, will quickly melt,

then, crackling quite strongly, it will take flight. One ought to congeal it in

a spoon or in a hollow crucible &amp; make a

moderately sized hole.

It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in aquafortis which beforehand will have eaten a little silver.

This one, mixed, makes tin &amp; lead run.
