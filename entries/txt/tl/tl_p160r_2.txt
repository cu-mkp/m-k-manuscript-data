Sand for flowers

If it is cast thick, it bears down too much on the flowers &
constricts them & reduces them as if massed together. Take heed
therefore to temper it until thin, & blow strongly before the flower
is covered. Cast at the side of the mold. And tempering the sand,
one ought not only to turn the spatula but to beat the sand in
water as if you were beating glair of egg.
