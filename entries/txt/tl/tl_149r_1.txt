Softening iron and rendering it very soft

Take sublimate, quicklime, soap from

Venice, horse dung, a little less

sublimate than the others. Wet all of this together like paste,

&amp; impaste the iron with it, &amp; envelop it in this

with some bad linen. Then make it reheat until it is

very red. Or leave overnight in a good fire until the

morning. It will be very soft for engraving on it well

whatever you want.
