Softening silver

When goldsmiths who work large wares have
forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that
it bursts & cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,
when it is well melted, some dry mortar composed of sand &
good lime which has been worked, & pulverize it & throw
it in.



Goldsmiths do not work at all with
the silver from reals that is not alloyed, because it is
leady & when forging it sours.



Some solder, for small works & things which only go in the fire
once, with some old sou & carolus, reheated & beaten. 
However, if the sou is not very
good, the solder eats away & one needs to solder there twice,
& one finds there too much copper. Others solder with
half silver & half fine copper.
