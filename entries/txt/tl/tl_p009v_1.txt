  They completely melt
  
   orpiment
  
  in a
  

    glass
   
   bottle
  
  on very
  
   hot ashes
  
  , but it would be more appropriate to
sublimate
  
   orpiment
  
  in a long-necked
  
   matrass
  
  as for
making
  
   garnets
  
  . The
  
   orpiment
  
  thus turns red like
  
   red
enamel
  
  & one needs to first grind it moist because once completely
melted it is very lively & difficult to grind. Next, one can
  

    br
   

  thin it, once dry, with
  
   oil
  
  & it will
make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent
  
   orpiment
  
  from dying with the other colors & to render it compatible with
these & to make it dry promptly, it is a secret held to be very rare to
calcine
  
   common salt
  
  & to grind it in.
