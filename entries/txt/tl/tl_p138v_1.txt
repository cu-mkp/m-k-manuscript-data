  Talcum
 
 mixed in the
 
  molds
 

  I took the one from which I had pulled the
  
   oil
  
  . I crushed it
very finely even more
  

    s
   

  in a
  

    steel
   
   mortar
  
  with a
  
   pestle
  
  , very lumpy like a
  
   file
  
  . I
rendered it very fine & in a cottony & downy powder. I mixed it
with
  
   sand
  
  & mixed it together & cast it
  
   en noyau
  
  . It
molded
  

    en no
   

  very neatly & one ought not to doubt
that it holds in the fire.
