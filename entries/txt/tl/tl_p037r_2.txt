Medicine for the stomach
which heats it and unstops the liver

Take
Take wormwood powder, dissolve it
in capilli veneris syrup or preserves, & make
with it an opiate of which you will take once a week on
a host soaked in wine. Then you will be able to drink a
finger of sufficiently tempered wine. This
dissipates the phlegm & the winds which arise from it. You can take
six pepper grains & grate their rinds such
that they are smooth, & swallow them without chewing. This benefits
the stomach without heating the liver.
