Fine sieves of raw silk

One makes tammy of raw silk on a loom, to make
fine & delicate sieves. And for that effect, you must not
choose raw silk whitened by sulfur smoke, which
renders the silk chas charged with a sticky
vapor that would hold the flour & in the end would prevent it
from













passing through so well. But choose for that effect yellow raw &
natural silk because it is stronger & casts out flour
like horsehair.
