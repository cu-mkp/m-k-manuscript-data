Stucco

For glueing stone, some do not use
<-poi-> resin & black pitch resin
because it is too fatty, but take rosin & sulfur,
as much <-as-> of one as the other, & as much of

wax as the two together, and mix it with pestled brick for greater
strength. Others, white chalk or white stone pestled & pulverized
& sieved.
