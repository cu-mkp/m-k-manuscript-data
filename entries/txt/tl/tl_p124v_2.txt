Casting in gold

Molds are reheated better & more surely in a closed
fire, such as pot in a reverberatory
furnace. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some
important piece of gold e that has cost a lot to model in
wax, they put the molds in a pot & cover
them, & fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire
that holds them together & tight. Then, they reheat the
mold, earth & pot together, and when
everything is quite red, they cast the gold. Fine gold does
not run well, but alloyed gold does.


Gold & silver do not sour,
being entirely red and hot, quenched
in water.





Gold is a quarter heavier than lead.





When gold reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
emerald.





Take care that in the place where you want to cast the gold, no
lead, tin, or lime of these has fallen in the
forge.
