White bronzing on plaster

One needs to give four layers of painters’ distemper glue

on the plaster portrait, always leaving each layer to

dry. Next, with minium from England  ground on marble, or

burnt lead, grind av &amp; temper with a bit of

gum or go glue, &amp; coat lightly. Once

dry, rub lightly with a little cotton and the plaster

portrait will seem to be of lead. Others grind minium with

quicksilver.
