Keeping animals

Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again,
put them back into the mixture of urine, vinegar
& eau-de-vie where you killed the others, and they will keep
for a long time without spoiling. If you have a cut on your hand,
take care that this mixture does not touch it.
