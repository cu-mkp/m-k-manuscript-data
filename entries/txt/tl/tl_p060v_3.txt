Spike lavender oil




One ought not to put any into colors for it is so brisk and
penetrating that it makes the colors flake, which next come off. And for
this reason, painters use it to clean their oil
paintbrush when they have become hard, for it renders them
soft & clean immediately, penetrating the dry color which encrusts
them. Also, painters, sometimes envious of the work
undertaken by another, in the evening secretly pour a few
drops of spike lavender on the oil on the top
edge of the panel such that, running down, it makes a stain that
penetrates as far as the wood & makes the colors come off such
that, to make the work even & of an equal composition, they are
forced to do everything again and thus lose their work.
