Chimolée

The terre chimolée, otherwise known as

fuller’s earth, with which they dress the

cloth, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; &amp; if you

want to reheat it, it must first be warm, &amp; reheat it on a gentle

fire at a distance &amp; little by little, otherwise it would crack.

Put the figure to reheat in a pot in an oven or in a

covered oven. It is very soft, neat &amp; beautiful. You

can make a hollow form of animals from chimolée &amp; cast

lead in it.

The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 days before you reheat

it. When you mold &amp; make a hollow form from chimolée, do

not press suddenly, but gently, for it would crack.
