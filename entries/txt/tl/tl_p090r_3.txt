good & proper for molding. For if it is coarse, pass it through a
sieve, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, & when
the water has rested a little, empty that which is still
troubled in some separate vessel. The coarse will promptly 
fall down to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which
will have come from the troubled water, set apart, having
settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough
bond, grind it quite dry on porphyry, & you will
render it impalpable, & which will have bond like chalk.
Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it & again will grind it & mix it with salts, or linen, or burnt
felt, or ashes of paper & similarly washed things.
