That any sand can be rendered good


Artisans who work in large works & who need to further
their profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she
does not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time they would
use for grinding finely & for artificially preparing sands, seek
the one of the <-s-> mine<-s->,
which is not too fatty, the one that is a kin of earth, not too lean &
consequently without bond, but rather that which is pulled from the
depths of the sand-bed in bricks & clods that show
its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break & which
has a very small & delicate grain, & which is found soft
when handling it between the fingers. And
because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous
areas or lean territories, & akin to the 
arene, it cannot be found <-in-> in the
surroundings of all the bonnes villes where
artisans willingly gather. And thus, if they do
not have it close to their house, they prefer to have it come
from afar, like from Lyon, Venice, Paris near the
Sainct Chappelle & similar places, rather than prepare it.
However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the
sand from a mine










good & proper for molding. For if it is coarse, pass it through a
sieve, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, & when
the water has rested a little, empty that which is still
troubled in some separate vessel. The coarse will promptly 
fall down to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which
will have come from the troubled water, set apart, having
settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough
bond, grind it quite dry on porphyry, & you will
render it impalpable, & which will have bond like chalk.
Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it & again will grind it & mix it with salts, or linen, or burnt
felt, or ashes of paper & similarly washed things.
