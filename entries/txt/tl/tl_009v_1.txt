They completely melt orpiment in a glass

bottle on very hot ashes, but it would be more appropriate to

sublimate orpiment in a long-necked matrass as for

making garnets. The orpiment thus turns red like red

enamel &amp; one needs to first grind it moist because once completely

melted it is very lively &amp; difficult to grind. Next, one can

br thin it, once dry, with oil &amp; it will

make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent orpiment

from dying with the other colors &amp; to render it compatible with

these &amp; to make it dry promptly, it is a secret held to be very rare to

calcine common salt &amp; to grind it in. 

Vert de terre is not used with oil.
