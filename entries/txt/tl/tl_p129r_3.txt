Viper color



It is the most beautiful snake that can be molded, because it
has very beautiful scales, & hard & transparent. Its true color
is made with good verdigris ground well with some good
vinegar, if it is of lead or tin. And if it is in some
place darker, fumigate this first color with sulfur, as you
know. And if one needs to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub
with coarse linen. The male ejects from its
nature, which is at the bottom, when it is
firmly pressed, a little mass like half an arquebus ball
made in the genitals and full of very venomous spurs.





+ Put a bit of metalline in your
tin & your lizard will resemble silver.
