Molds

Make the notches from those that enter more into the inside of the

mold than on the outside, for in this way, they have more

strength. Keep from reheating in one go &amp; in too ardent a fire, for

this makes them melt break.

Do not keep them in a humid or

enclosed place if they are not quite dry e, for they go moldy. So do

dried animals.

One ought not to reheat molds

twice when the animal can be removed without burning, like a

toad, which can well be molded hollow like all thick animals.

However, it is always good to redden the mold once.
