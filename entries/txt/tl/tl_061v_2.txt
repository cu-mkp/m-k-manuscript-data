Frames of the Germans 

Germans who work in miniature make frames not of
glass, but of canvas anointed with clear turpentine
varnish, namely half turpentine oil &amp; almost
half turpentine, because this light, which is not as bright
as from glass, makes features appear larger to them. And when they want
to make something subtle like veins de &amp; similar
things, they use paintbrushes composed of two or three
rat whiskers.
