Carton

One ought to take paper from Florence, which is the

finest, &amp; pestle it &amp; soak it several times &amp; change the

water every day, so that it does not smell bad, &amp;

when you have molded it in the hollow form, put a

linen over it, &amp; from the back, rub the back of the

paper with a tooth, as if you wanted to burnish it, and

it will mold very neatly. Then glue the cloth on the back

with strong glue.
