Semi-lively colors

When colors aabsorb into the canvas, it

means that it has been given imprimatura only once, &amp; for this reason they

become matte rather than being shiny. But this is the best,

as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having

more body, do not die &amp; are all the more beautiful for it,

especially azure, lake, &amp; those do not have body. But

those who want to rush their painting apply imprimatura twice on the first go, to be

done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as

long. The second layer of these does not absorb &amp; remains

shiny.
