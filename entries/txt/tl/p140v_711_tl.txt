Cast of lead and tin in plaster



If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very
weighty, and that does not need to burn in the mold, you can
cast in plaster & brick mixed like above, and not in
plaster alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if
it does not have a companion. But, with brick, it holds well.
However, take heed to dry out your mold at length & on a
slow fire & with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But
when your work is of flowers or other things that want to
be their molds reheated & set ablaze, mix in some
feather alum & even some crocum. I have
molded in plaster & brick very neatly & it
withstood several castings.

I triedplaster &
brick alone and molded en noyau like others. My
mold was very neat, having lightly oiled & rubbed
with eau-de-vie my medal. I made my gate ample at the entrance,
narrowing it until the medal, which was very thin. I notched the gate
which embraced well the medal. I dried the mold well on a slow
fire & at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let it
cool in such a way that I could hold my finger
to it without burning myself. I made an alloy of 4
℥ of tin, & six
deniers of lead. I cast red, and it came out
well. Next, I put in for 4 ℥ of
tin xii deniers of lead, it came out
very well.



When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat
it for lead & tin. But for flowers & what should
burn, yes.
