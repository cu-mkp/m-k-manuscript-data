Sapphire

One finds sapphires that one calls of the trellis, because they are pierced and it is said that a

certain king had made from these a certain ornament in the

shape of a trellis, as would perhaps be the Screen of 

Charlemagne, as it is called, in the treasure of Saint Denis, in which the gemstones are

mounted without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one

side &amp; the other, &amp; to show their vividness. I have a white one one

that seems to be rough &amp; pierced, and is spotted all over with blue

blemishes. I am of the opinion that these are artificial &amp; that they

are of taffer or very clear esmail azur√©

melted entirely on the sapphire. The file bites on it

as on the beryl.
