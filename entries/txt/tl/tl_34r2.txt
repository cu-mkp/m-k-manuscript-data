X Wager someone <-e-> that walking
to a certain place and back, he cannot say boot without spur four times
in a row

X If he tries to say<-a-> it,
but be sure that he speaks loudly, once he has been
there & back, you will tell him that he has lost, because he needed
to say boot four times without saying spur, for that is your
wager.
