  Paintbrushes
 

  When the color has dried inside, & you want to clean them, soak
them in
  

    spike lavender
   
   oil
  
  and they immediately will
turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in
  

    walnut
   
   oil
  
  .
  

    Walnut
   
   oil
  
  is not
  
   as
not
  
  as appropriate to soften them as that of
  

    spike
lavender
   

  , which is clear like
  
   water
  
  & penetrates
& does not have body like
  

    walnut
   
   oil
  
  . The
  
   handle
of paintbrushes
  
  is made by those who work with
care from
  

    porcupine
   
   quills
  
  ,
by others from
  

    wood
   
   of arrows from
   
    Turkey
   


   with whom
  
  with which they also make
  
   small rods to rest
their
   
    hand
   
   when they are painting
  
  .
 

  To work well on a small scale
  
   very thin paintbrushes which
have a firm point
  



     z
    


  are
  

    on
   



  needed. And because a
  

    squirrel
   
   ’s tail hair
  
  is soft,
the most careful take the
  
   bristles of the oldest
   
    rats
   

  ,
especially of
  
   dormice
  
  if they can find them, & put two or
three of them in the middle of the
  
   paintbrush
  
  . These make
a straight line like a
  

    quill
   

  & all the other
  
   hairs
  


  of the
  
   paintbrush
  
  stick to them as to the
point. The
  
   bristles of
   
    beech martens
   
   &
   
    weasels
   
   & small animals that make
   
    musk
   

  are even better, for a
single
  
   hair
  
  in a
  
   paintbrush
  
  suffices.
 




   Lake
  
  &
  
   lead white
  
  &
  
   ceruse
  
  are easy to
work in
  
   oil
  
  , but every kind of
  
   azure
  
  is difficult. And to
make beautiful
  
   azure
  
  , one needs to layer it not with large
strokes of the
  
   paintbrush
  
  but with small strokes of the
point. Not only
  
   ash
  
  &
  

    azur d’
    
     Acre
    




  but mainly
  

    azur d’esmail
   

  which one needs to choose to be very delicate.
  
   For it
  
  Otherwise you will not
  

    v
   

  be able to work with it
except with much work, and even then you need to allay it with
  
   turpentine
  
  to give it body, and mix it with a little
  
   lead
white
  
  . Any
  
   azure
  
  wants neither to be ground nor washed for it
loses color & becomes pale. But putting it powdered on your
  
   palette
  
  , you will thin it little by little either with
  

    walnut
   
   oil
  
  or
  
   turpentine oil
  
  ,
dipping a
  
   knife point
  
  in the
  
   oil
  
  , then
tempering it little by little on the said
  
   palette
  
  .
