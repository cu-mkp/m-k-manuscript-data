A means of goldsmiths for molding hollow



They mold in two cuttlefish bones their animal
or other work that they have either already made or modelled in
wax & cast in lead. Once it is well imprinted in the
two cuttlefish bones, they place between these
two bones a paper, & join the
bones & cast. The work comes out split in half. And
then, with <-ch-> a chaple, they
hollow out as finely as they please the two halves cast in gold
or silver, and then solder or braze them.
