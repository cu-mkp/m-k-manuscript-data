 For making it seem
 
  that
 
 to someone that he has a
 
  piece
of
  
   silver
  

 on his
 
  forehead
 

  Take a
  
   token
  
  or
  
   piece of
   
    silver
   

  and wet it
and make it hold against your
  
   forehead
  
  . Then say to the
  
   bystander
  
  that if you put it thus on his
  
   forehead
  
  ,
he will not be able to make it fall without lifting his
  
   hands
  
  to it, no matter how he shakes his
  
   head
  
  . And making it seem as
if you are placing it on his
  
   forehead
  
  , retain it in your
  
   hand
  
  & wet your
  
   thumb
  
  with your
  

    saliva
   

  then press it quite strongly on his
  
   forehead
  
  . And thinking he has the piece on his
  
   forehead
  
  due to the
  
   coolness
  
  of the
  

    saliva
   

  , he will shake his
  
   ears
  
  & will get
nowhere.
