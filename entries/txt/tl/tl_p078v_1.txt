For making bronze in the color of steel

Take glass alum & antimony, but one
needs twice as much glass alum as
antimony, and pestle the whole together in an iron
mortar, & then mix with gum water while grinding it on
marble, & then one needs to use it with a
paintbrush, & next let it dry, and then polish it
with a tooth of a wolf or dog.
