For ruby take gold leaf

Raise your furnace by two tiles all

around, because one needs more heat for making rubies than for

emeralds. And take one ℥ of white

calcined pebbles and put it in a mortar of glass, &amp; having ground it coarsely with the pestle of the same,

mix in a grain the weight of a

grain of gold leaf of what the painters

gild, &amp; grind

Some say that, mixing the gold with the pebbles and the

saltpeter, it makes the color of a peach tree.

Others say that it is necessary that the gold be cemented several

times, then beaten into leaf.

again very well, then add in iii ℥ of

minium, &amp; pestle well again all together, &amp; put

it in the crucible, which you will cover with an appropriate

tile, a bit thick, in order that heat reverberates better

there. Then, set it on the grate of your furnace,

having put under a few thick rounded squares. Next, fill your

furnace to the opening with charcoal, so that it will

be heaped, and let it kindle, and always maintain the heat evenly

without letting the charcoal decrease. And for this effect,

always make it so that the furnace is heaped &amp; full of

charcoal, and maintain it thus for one day.

The first experience that I made of it, it only returned a yellow mass,

as is vitrified minium alone, &amp; some grains of

gold in a mass at the bottom. Try cemented gold

and accompanied with antimony.

If you need greater heat, plie put, on the edge of

the opening of the glowing furnace, tiles, one against

the other, for making the heat reverberate.
