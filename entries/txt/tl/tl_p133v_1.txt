This readily comes about when you cast two or three small
molds, one after the other, in the same bowl, for the last

which readily becomes porous. The thinnest casts more finely & more
neatly, provided that one blows strongly enough when casting on the tempered
& cast sand in order to dissipate these small bubbles.
