in a round form to cast it in gold and silver, put
only in your wax what you prepare for this effect
<-sino-> from all these drugs, except casting with
melted sulfur, since it is melted, & candle
smoke. The melted sulfur goes to the bottom and nevertheless
leaves its quality in the wax, making it melt promptly in the fire
& giving it firmness. In this way, you can melt in the fire this
roughed out <-ci-> figure of wax. But if it is
composed of ceruse or suchlike, it is necessary that you
put your mold in boiling water.



For figures of flat wax, there is no need for all this, for the
wax releases & does not stay in the <-la->
mold.
