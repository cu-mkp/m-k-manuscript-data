 Molded
 
  waxes
 

  Figures of
  
   wax
  
  composed of
  
   ceruse
  
  &
  
   lead
white
  
  are not for burning & melting in a
  
   mold
  
  where you
want to cast
  
   gold
  
  &
  
   silver
  
  , for this would sour it.
And then, if you think about taking away these
  
   waxes
  
  composed of
things coming from the
  
   metals
  
  reheated in the
  
   mold
  
  , you
will be wrong, because, the asperity of the fire making them seethe
  

    ir
   

  ,
  

  the
  
   wax
  
  goes away & the composition
of the
  
   ceruse
  
  or other metallic color attacks the
  
   mold
  
  .
And for this reason, if you want to rough out something

   Nota
  







   White wax
  
  is more delicate than the other & it does not leave
any
  
   filth
  
  when you want to make
  
   noyau
  
  and mold
hollow.
 



  in a round form to cast it in
  
   gold
  
  and
  
   silver
  
  , put
only in your
  
   wax
  
  what you prepare for this effect
  

    sino
   

  from all these drugs, except casting with
  
   melted sulfur
  
  , since it is melted, &
  

    candle
   
   smoke
  
  . The melted
  
   sulfur
  
  goes to the bottom and nevertheless
leaves its quality in the
  
   wax
  
  , making it melt promptly in the fire
& giving it firmness. In this way, you can melt in the fire this
roughed out
  

    ci
   

  figure of
  
   wax
  
  . But if it is
composed of
  
   ceruse
  
  or suchlike, it is necessary that you
put your
  
   mold
  
  in
  
   boiling water
  
  .
 

  For figures of flat
  
   wax
  
  , there is no need for all this, for the
  
   wax
  
  releases & does not stay in the
  

    la
