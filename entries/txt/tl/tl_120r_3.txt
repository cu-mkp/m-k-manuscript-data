IlNightingale

One needs for the cage, made like those for larks

like a barn &amp; lined with green fabric, to be

made with a drawer underneath, to refresh its fresh earth

everyday, for it takes much delight in this, &amp; mix in it

some ants. You can carry an anthill with its earth

in a barrel full of earth, &amp; keep them there &amp; they

will lay their eggs there, in order to always have some at hand when you

want them, should you take pleasure in feeding nightingales.

When you have taken it, it is fat &amp; full, &amp; thus, to keep it in

its strength, one needs to, for the first day,

take uyit in the

hand &amp; open its beak &amp; put in its beak with a

small pointed stick some mutton heart or other

delicate flesh, chopped up not too finely, in order to fill its

belly &amp; keep it from diminishing &amp; growing leaner, until it

has gotten over its fancy. The next day you will give

him And you will feed it in this way three or four times a

day &amp; will also make it drink. The next

morning, you will give it in its cage some well-minced

flesh with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and change it two or three

times a day, for it will not eat it if it is

hardened &amp; if it is not fresh. And if it goes half a

day without eating, one needs to feed it as before &amp;

do so until it

eats by itself. And to entice it better, you could add amongst the

meat &amp; the egg some live mealworms, for it is

very fond of them.
