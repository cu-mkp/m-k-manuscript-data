Birds

        

Those that can are taken at St. Michael are

good for keeping, but those that are taken in March die,

because they are starting to fall into love. Ortolans

are fed on oats all summer in order that they are nourished without becoming

fat, to be more appropriate for hunting &amp; catching others.

Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them

millet. They sing at night. One needs to

c take them after mid-July until

St. Michael, for after that time when they have their young in

this country, they go away like turtledoves do. Siskins

should also be taken from All Saintsâ€™ Day until

Christmas, for after that they go to the mountains to

brood.

            

        

            

            

            

Ortolans are ventriloquists, such that singing without

opening the beak, one would say that they are.
