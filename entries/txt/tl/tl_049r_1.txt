Casting of lead

Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of

churches, y melt one for one

lb of tin a half of lead, &amp;

cast in stone, &amp; if they want their work whiter, they put

p half tin and half lead, but

the first mixture is the best, &amp; does not become porous. One needs

to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke

their molds with a resin candle to cast neatly. The

antimony makes the substance brittle &amp; breakable. The

looking-glass tin makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as

for tin, it works well to the with pure lead.

Those who make very neat lead casts, use puncheon.

Pewterers cast in a copper mold. One says

that one makes lead take hold on glass with

resin. Some put into the lead a quarter of

tin. Looking-glass tin  renders the work stronger.
