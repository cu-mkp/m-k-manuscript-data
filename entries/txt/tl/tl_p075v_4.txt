Recipe for putting all woods in color

For making it black, one needs to soak it in olive
oil, and similarly for horn, as the case may be, four or five
days, & then boil it where it has soaked
for the space of one hour, & take it out of the
oil, and take some natural sulfur or another











if you cannot find it, and cover the said wood with this
powder, until it is cool, & you will make it boil again, &
boiling it, one will see if it is black enough or not. If it is not
enough, you take the said powder & put it on the said wood
while boiling.
