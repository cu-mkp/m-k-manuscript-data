Sand



If there is not enough good feather alum or
crocum, it will easily crack in the fire. But if it is
mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. It is recognized to be
good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes water
when one quenches it & <-rends-> breaks
easily because the alum & the crocum render
it spongy. On the contrary, bad sand, which is only of plaster &
brick, & little mixed with alum, breaks easily in the
fire & hardens in water. Cast, if possible, all in one
go.
