Those of the houses that are not sandy seem to withstand
fire better.





Tiles with which one covers houses, the hardest
& firmest, and purged of stones & coarse gravel,
are used to <-p-> mix in with the sand
<-And-> for molding. But, before, it is necessary to heat
them until they have been quite red for one or two
hours, & pestle them & pass them finely
through a sieve.

        

The little turtles, having just come out of the egg, are
very nice to mold.
