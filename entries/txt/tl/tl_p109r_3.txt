Molding wax

In order that your mold grips without repelling in any place on
a shape or image of wax, you need to anoint it with oil
and moisten your sand with lukewarm water, for the cold
water would repel the oil more & would not have a good seating on it.





Anoint well, very lightly, with oil, so little that it hardly
appears. Then, rub with some eau-de-vie. Next, moisten your sand
with lukewarm water so that it does not repel the
oil.
