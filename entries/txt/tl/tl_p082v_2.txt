Casting lead in lead

There are some who make their hollow forms with thick lead, then
cast lead in them.

Lead when not cast hot enough, is white, & blacker when cast
well hot.



One can make a lead mold, & to cast in it, smoke
it with candle black. But it is never that neat.




Never does lead come so neat as tin.
