  As soon as the colors of panels are well dried, the
  
   Flemish
  
  varnish them so they do not die any more than they already have & remain in that
state.
 

  The one who knows to work well in
  
   distemper
  
  will work well in
  
   oil
  
  . But, on the contrary, the one who knows how to work well in
  
   oil
  
  will not work in
  
   distemper
  
  .
