Vine leaf and small frog

Take vine leaves to mold as they are in growth, likewise with

all plants &amp; flowers, or a young vine growing again after

having been cut, or when they rebud in autumn, because the

new leaves are more lumpy &amp; have more apparent lineation. On the

contrary, old leaves are smooth on the inside &amp; pierced in several

places. Therefore place your leaf bottom down on the clay

slab, and secure it with small points, nevertheless

leaving it its natural curve. And make a notch in the

clay to hide the stem at the first cast, which, once made

&amp; dry, you will take away the stem from the leaf &amp; clean with it

well with small bristle brushes &amp; fix it with a small mound

of clay. Next, make several gates around the leaf with wax,

as you know, &amp; gec make the gate thin &amp; with

several lines &amp; lumpy.

The vine leaf is painted with green made of stil de grain

yellow &amp; verd de terre.

You can cast on the leaf a spider or frog &amp;

whatever you will like.
