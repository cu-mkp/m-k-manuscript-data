Mending the cracks in a panel

If a painted panel breaks you can glue it well on the

reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it &amp;

repair it, it ought not to be with glue, which rots in damp

weather &amp; would swell when touched with the oil of the

painting. But take white wax, which is harder than the other.

The oil mixed in among the wax prevents it from

melting in the sun. The wax ought not to be hard, but

soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks &amp; crevices with the

tip of a knife, then scrape;

and to prevent it from breaking, mix in little oil &amp;

melt them together &amp; fill the cracks &amp; make them even and paint

on them. And the oil mixed with wax will

q better receive color, which is also

tempered with oil.
