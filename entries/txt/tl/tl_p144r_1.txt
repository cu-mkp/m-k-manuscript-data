having been thus arranged & well cleaned with
brushes, place <-the-> the circle of
clay around the slab. Then, with a band of
clay placed on the middle of <-e-> the
<-the-> back of the turtle, as you see, & at the
widest place, divide your mold. Subsequently, oil with
your paintbrush dedicated for this the half of the shell
you want to mold. Temper in hot water, so that without burning
yourself, you can hold your finger in it without
burning yourself, your sand, a little <-p-> thick.
And <-f-> before casting it, rub the shell with
eau-de-vie. And next, cast your sand & let it set, and note
that all things that have shells or that are hard or are not
malleable, like snakes & lizards, want to be
oiled to release. Things that are malleable do not need this.
Hot water makes the tempered sand <-in water-> set
better on oil, which otherwise would be refused.



    
 Once your half of the
turtle is thus <-desp-> molded,
separate it, with its half mold, from the clay
slab that you will set aside to return it to when it is necessary.
Next, clean your half mold & smooth it & flatten, like
the others. But because it happens that because <-u-> of
the clay entredeux, the half mold will consist
of more than half of the turtle, cut & pare down smoothly
the excess, & clean everything well with brushes. Then,
make on the top edge of the mold, on the side that is cut &
halfway, two notches, like for other molds, and return your
turtle to its slab as it was, & secure its two
legs, which are not molded, with iron wire points. And
stuff all around what is empty, up until the edge of the top shell, with
clay. Next, place the circle around and put a
clay entredeulx on the first mold, a little
above the notches. And having oiled the <-d->
first half mold, & its notches, and the shell of the
turtle, & having also showered it with eau-de-vie,
heat your water, temper you sand with a little sal
ammoniac water & the said hot water, & cast. Having set,
adapt the sides of these two molds smoothly, & on each side
secure their joint, which can only just be perceived, with two
clamps, in order that when uncovering afterward the underneath
of the turtle, they are not undone. Next, uncover the side of
the belly & of the throat, in the way that you uncover a
crayfish, which is the most difficult to mold of the little
beasts, which are molded in two halves.








You can mold the turtle with one piece for each side, but one
would need to burn it. And afterward, to make the hollow, the reheated
mold cannot be oiled because it drinks the
oil.

If there is some crocum in the sand, the joints of the
molds can hardly be perceived.

Turtles

Those of water are more beautiful & easier
to mold <-than those->, being flatter & having a longer head
& tail <-q-> and legs straighter & better to
release than those of the garrigue, which
are lean, wrinkled & well ensconced in their shell, which also have
a rounder top of the shell & nevertheless narrower <-v->
on the sides than near the middle, which is the reason their
<-l-> top shell cannot be molded well in one piece like
those of the water.


        
When they are better mortified & rested two or three
days, they bend and are handled better.



 <-Therefore-> Thus, you
will mold their top shell in two pieces, the bottom ones in two or three
or four, according to the need. But, note that if you want to release
your turtle from the mold without burning it, it needs
to be molded thus in several pieces. But, if you want it to be burned
<-p-> inside, you can mold the top shell in one piece.
Therefore, to put your hand to the work after you have killed it entirely
in vinegar & urine, as said, let it dry well. And
clean it well with your small bristle brushes. Next, <-not-> take your
clay slab and put it on top and smudge it a little, in order
that the bottom shell fastens to it, having, nevertheless, earlier
shaped the head with a strong point, as with other animals,
making it hold high by the means of <-one-> a little fresh
clay that you will adapt from underneath. Stretch the said
head & legs with your little pincers. The head arranged,
dexterously place <-d-> a grain of yellow
millet in each eye with pincers, because as soon as
they are dead the eyes are burst and putrid. You can do this as well
with all other small animals, with some grain of large
amaranth, some of small, and grain of
rapeseed, & this done, you will arrange the legs,
securing them with iron points and then, with some
clay, fill up all the empty space around the turtle,
that is to say what is between the two shells, in order that the sand
entering there does not prevent it from releasing. And because the legs
should be lower than the shell of the <-s->
<-e-> <-of-> belly, make a little pit in the
clay slab to adapt them there. Your turtle
