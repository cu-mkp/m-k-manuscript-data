For casting

Chalk most recently taken from the quarry is good
for lead. One ought neither to wet nor grind it, but render it subtle by
pestling or scraping & passing through a sieve. Thus for pumice,
which one ought not to grind with water, nor corrupt its nature. 
Lead should be but little mixed with tin,
only for giving it strength, and two parts
<-of tin for-> lead for <-of-> one of
tin or more.
