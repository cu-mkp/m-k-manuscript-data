Varnish dry in an hour

Take white turpentine oil &amp;

turpentine &amp; mastic, pulverized &amp; passed delicately

through a sieve, &amp; boil together, stirring

continuously with a stick until it is dry. And put in two

liards' worth of good eau-de-vie. And if you extract

the tear of mastic, it will be whiter &amp; clearer. There is no

need to put in turpentine, but only its white turpentine

oil &amp; mastic pulverized at your discretion, until it has

enough body. +

Which one knows when, being placed on a knife in the

wind, it does not run. This one is excellent for panels and is dry

within an hour and does not stick like the

turpentine one.
