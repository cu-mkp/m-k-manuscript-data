Azure

Azure is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel
<-without-> with walnut oil with which it has
been first thinned, without putting in spike lavender
oil. And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will
not shine, thus appearing to be well-imbibed. If not, it will shine.

Azur dâ€™esmail <-imbibed in oil-> tempered
in oil, leaves it & returns to its primary nature if you mix it
in water.

Colors for working in miniature want to be thoroughly ground, &
work them with a point of a paintbrush if you want your
work to be well-softened.
