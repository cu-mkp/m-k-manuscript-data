Tiles

Tiles with which one covers houses, the hardest

&amp; firmest, and purged of stones &amp; coarse gravel,

are used to p mix in with the sand

et for molding. But, before, it is necessary to heat

them until they have been quite red for one or two

hours, &amp; pestle them &amp; pass them finely

through a sieve.

The little turtles, having just come out of the egg, are

very nice to mold.

Those of the houses that are not sandy seem to withstand

fire better.
