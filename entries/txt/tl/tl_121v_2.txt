Silver for casting

It is not fine silver but alloyed, &amp; which does not

become perfectly white on the fire because they put it to whiten after the

fusion to also clean it of the solder or of this. When

you need to attach some leg animal against another or to

repair, it is commonly teston silver. And all

alloyed silver, as long as it is sweet, is good.

Before starting to cast in silver, one needs to

have earth of which which withstands the fire, like

the sandy earth of qu mixed with cloth

waste which founders use to cast their cannons, or any

good lute which withstands the fire, in order to surround your

molds &amp; fortify them, for they must be all red. One

needs to also bind them with iron wire.

That before casting l'ar reheating the molds, you

have the mixture one needs to make the silver run.

If the goldsmiths knew knew the substance to make

silver run in their works, they would buy much of it. Some buy it five

sous for a denier.

I have used silver from the Capital

Before binding luting &amp; strengthening your molds

for gold &amp; silver with the aforesaid earth, one

needs for the cast to be made &amp; the vents, &amp; the molds

to have been reheated of very red to burn the animals,

flowers, and plants that are inside, &amp; to clean them well of the

ashes. Once quite clean &amp; prepared, lute them &amp; bind them

with iron wire, &amp; reheat them again until they will

be quite red.
