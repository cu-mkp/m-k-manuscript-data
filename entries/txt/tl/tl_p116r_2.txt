  with

 , with the same
 
  sand
 
 ,
 
  wax
 
 images, or
 
  lead
 
 medals and suchlike
 
  Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with
  
   wax
  
  what does not, and then anoint your images of
  
   wax
  
  or of
  
   lead
  
  with
  

    olive
   
   oil
  
  , very thinly & very
lightly, such that the
  
   oil
  
  makes no thickness nor body on the
medal. Then, heat a little
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  ,
  
   until
  
  & when it is lukewarm, moisten the
  
   oiled
  
  medal with it, for if
  
   it is
  
  the
  
   water
  
  were cold, it
would reject the
  
   oil
  
  , it would not sit well on it. Next, cast your
  
   sand
of
   
    plaster
   
   ,
   

     bri
    


    brick
   
   , &
   
    wet alum
   

  on top, having arranged your image on the
  
   clay
  

   mandore
  
  & having made a circle around it
  

    de
   

  to give it the necessary thickness. These medals
are
  
   oiled
  
  and rubbed thus with
  

    eau-de-vie
   

  because they are firm & hard & would not be malleable for taking
out of the
  

    e
   




   the
  

   mold
  
  , which is
tenacious, as are natural animals, which are soft &
flexible.
 

  When you have tempered your
  
   sand
  
  , do not cast it in the middle of the
  
   mold
  
  but on the sides, so that the
  
   sand
  
  descends gently and
that the beginning is thin & afterward thick. If your
  
   tempered sand
  
  sounds like
  
   water
  
  falling in the
  
   mold
  
  , it is a sign that
is too thin. Make it, therefore, of medium thickness.
