Glassworker

Glass from Lorraine is smoother &amp; more even than

plate glass and it is sturdier &amp; more durable. But commonly

it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens

because the glassmakers, having made it, put it when totally

hot on straw, which stains it in this way. However, this

is removed with varnish &amp; salt &amp; other

drugs that the glassworkers put on. Glass from Lorraine is sold by the bundle &amp; each

bundle is composed of three tablets.

The bundle costs usually x sous.

Plate glass is sold in made in France, it is

whiter &amp; clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from

Lorraine. It is also commonly blown &amp; in that case, it is

better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the

shape of a frame, because they cannot be set quite evenly.

Plate glass is sold by paniers. Every

panier contains 24 plates that are

commonly sold at x or twelve lb.
