Linseed

Whoever wants to have it beautiful &amp; p very
delicate needs to pick it before the fd
seed is perfectly ripe. For if one waits for the seed to be
perfectly ripe, the foot is so dried by the sun that it is brittle &amp;
breakable. It is true that in this way the seed is reduced by a
third.
