Essential oils

Walnut oil mixed with as much of
turpentine & distilled through an alembic renders an
essence whiter than common water. But this has no body & does
not give bond to colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
the color without hold and fading. These, imbibing in this way,
would not give you leisure to work and soften any more than in distemper. But
you mend this defect by giving it a little body with
turpentine, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
work with azur d'esmail & will make a perfect
lead white. Turpentine varnish made with this oil
is dry in one hour.
