Sand

I tried the bone of oxen feet, thoroughly burned &amp;

pulverized &amp; ground on porphyry, until it is

not felt between your fingers. It molds on its

own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid &amp; lean, it

wants to be well wettted &amp; moistened with wine boiled with

elm root.

Iron dross, well burned bone of oxen feet,

felt also well burned over a closed fire, and all three very well

ground on porphyry mold very neatly in lead,

without needing to be reheated a lot, &amp; casting

it in a hot or cold frame.

Felt alone molds very neatly once moistened &amp; releases

well, and also makes the other two release.

These sands only withstand one casting.

A fatty sand which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.

A fatty metal needs lean sand.
