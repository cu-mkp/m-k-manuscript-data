Hard wax for imprinting seals

It is made from white wax, which is harder than the other,
&amp; one mixes in very finely ground ceruse or lead white until
it becomes as hard as you fancy u, adding to it a
drop of turpentine to bind it. Next, mix in whatever
color you want. This is the wax goldsmiths use for
modeling.
