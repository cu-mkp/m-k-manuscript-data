  A steel
 
 touch-hole
 
  is
put in the
  
   cannons
  
  in the manner of a screw so it will not be damaged
during firing like the others very quickly will be. But these screws
are prone to blow off & cause damage to the
  
   gunner
  
  . There
is nothing for it but to use a proper touch-hole.
