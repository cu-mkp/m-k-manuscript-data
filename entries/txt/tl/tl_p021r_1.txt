  Gunner
 

  As for small
  
   cannons
  
  which are not loaded with a
  
   ladle
  
  ,
one charges them with
  
   powder
  

   up to the escutcheon
  
  ,
  

  which
is placed on the
  
   piece
  
  with due proportion.
 

  To point a
  
   cannon
  
  , that is to say to take its aim, one needs to take
the sight, that is to say aim, from the sides before the top, that is to
say above the
  
   cannon
  
  . For by aiming along the top, you will be better
able to find the line tending to your target, but you would not find out
if the
  
   cannon
  
  tends more to one side than the other. Therefore take your
sight on one side, then on the other & adjust your
  
   piece
  
  to the
point at which you aim. Then take your sight from the top of the breech,
which will be done quickly. Next, lower your
  
   piece
  
  a little at your
discretion if you are within true range, because the force of the
  
   powder
  
  usually makes it rise. But if you were farther away than
your
  
   piece
  
  shoots at point-blank, you would need to consider that the
weight of the ball would make it lower.
