Sand from Thoulouse

The usual <-bo-> good one is the one which is
found in a vineyard near Puy David, but the one
which is most excellent is the one is from the Touch, near
Sainct Michel & toward Blagnac, in a
vineyard that is quite high up. The latter is thinner
& a little fatter than the other, & better for small works. It
does not want to be reheated too much.
