But <-because-> the fingers do not press
evenly, for <-one-> if you press on the edges, the middle will
remain hollow. Begin, therefore, by the middle, & then follow the
edges. But to make it better, put on the medal something flat &
smooth, or some large square file <-e->, & press with
this, for you will press equally, sometimes <-after l->
with your knee, other times with your
foot with your shoe taken off, & make the
bone be on top; thus you <-lâ€™emprand->
will imprint it without breaking it. If, on the first go, it is not
molded well, return to it several times. Then, repair & smooth on the
sides your <-d-> halves of molded bone.
<-&-> And to cut it well, always begin coming from the
softest part to the scales. And if your medal does not come out by
itself, scratch the bone from the back, which is rugged,
and it will release. When you want to cast, secure & join your two
bones with some small points of wood,
&c. But to mold very neatly, there is only our sand.
