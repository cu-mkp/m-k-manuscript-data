Salt for melting

Mix saltpeter &amp; common salt, and melt them together,

&amp; cast on melted copper or ch in a

bath, &amp; it purifies &amp; makes it run marvellously. First,

one ought to decrepitate the common salt, that is to say

holding it over a good fire until it no longer crackles or, to melt it

better, in a four Ã  vent. And cast it neatly on

marble, then pestle it &amp; grind it very finely, then

put it in a crucible on as much saltpeter &amp;

let it boil, &amp; mix them together until

It cleans &amp; purifies metal well.

the crucible will be red. Next, cast it on

marble, and you will have a substance white, hard &amp;

even, like alabaster, with which you will be able to cast medals

which will resemble marble, but keep them out of the

humidity.
