Pounced design for scratching satin

After you have pounced with flour or ground chalk, in
order that the dots of the pounced design be not erased, follow the
trace with glair beaten with the milk or bark of the
fig tree, which will immediately make it clear up like
water, & without becoming thick, it will keep the trace, which
you will follow again & scratch with <-d-> a
piece of glass or a penknife.
