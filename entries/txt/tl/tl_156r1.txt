Molding promptly and reducing a hollow form to a relief

You can imprint the relief of a medal in colored wax, &
you will have a hollow form, in which you can cast en noyau a relief
of your sand, on which you will make a hollow form of lead
or tin, in which you will cast a wax relief. And then on
that wax you will make your mold
en noyau hollow, to cast there the relief of gold &
silver or any other metal you like. But to hasten your
work if you are in a hurry, make the first imprint & hollow form in
bread pith, prepared as you know, which will mold very neatly.
And into that, cast in melted wax, which will give you a beautiful
relief on which you will make your noyau.
