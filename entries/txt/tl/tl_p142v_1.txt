Molding grasshoppers and things too thin

If you have a written paper to mold that is too thin, after
you have made the first cast & it has set, give a little thickness
to the reverse of your paper with melted butter, which is
the most appropriate means there is, & for fortifying the wings of
either a butterfly or a grasshopper, or some delicate
part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to
apply this melted butter underneath the wing or in whichever
place it cannot be seen. For giving thickness to a pansy or
other flowers, butter is not good, but rather wheat
oil, which is soon dry & holds firm. Wax would not be
appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, & it makes the thing
to which it is applied contract. But butter is amiable and
handleable.

If you write on paper or on
common carton & if your
letter is of gum, the humidity of the clay
slab or the wetted sand for noyau will moisten your
letter & undo it. Therefore write with
cinnabar wetted with oil on oiled paper
& press in.

+ Reheat your
molds with charcoals previously lit in the forge,
in order that the fire is not so hot & does not break the
molds. And do not make as much fire where the mold is
thin as in the place where it is thick.
