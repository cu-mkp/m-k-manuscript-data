  Arquebusier
 

  For firing your
  
   arquebus
  
  precisely, it is necessary that the end
of the breech be & come precisely to the edge of the touch-hole,
because in this manner the
  
   powder
  
  , without blowing, catches &
burns all at once & has more force & does not push back. On the
contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the
  
   powder
  
  catches sooner in this place, makes it push back, &
blows, which a
  
   chambered arquebus
  


  clearly
shows, which pushes back more than another. And since the barrel is
thicker at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for
that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. And then, the
thickness of the barrel gains about one
  
   line
  
  over the caliber,
and the sight another. It would therefore be necessary to either
make the barrel all of one thickness or to raise the stock
  
   on
  
  at
the end & toward the muzzle, & sink it in & lower it
toward the breech.
  

  The weight of the
  
   powder
  
  must be the third part of the ball.
