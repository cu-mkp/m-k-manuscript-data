 Molding a
 
  fly
 


   Large flies
  
  can be molded &
  

    g
   



  made
by casting. But one needs
  

    par d
   

  to anoint underneath
their wings with
  

    wheat
   
   oil
  
  , which dries quickly and
fortifies them & gives them a little thickness. The same is done to
  
   butterflies
  
  ,
  
   cicadas
  
  ,
  
   grasshoppers
  
  &
similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some
leaf or bouquet. The others are
  
   made by hand
  
  with a
  
   very
thin silver sheet
  
  . One ought not to keep them once dead,
because they dry out and their legs break.
  





    Wheat
   
   oil
  
  is put underneath delicate things to render
them more rigid & firm & to make them hold their natural
position. Because being weak & delicate, the
  
   tempered sand
  
  , weighing down
their tops, would change their form.
