    Azur dâ€™esmail
   

  always wants to be cleaned, because the
  
   filth
  
  that can be perceived in the
  
   wash water
  
  makes it die. One needs
to layer it two times, & the first very thick, moving the
  
   paintbrush
  
  by layering it first lengthwise then across.
  

  It is better used on
  
   canvas
  
  , where it is imbibed
immediately, than on
  
   wood
  
  .
  
   Varnish
  
  returns it to its
vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To assay it,
  
   painters
  
  bring their
  
   palette
  
  to the
  
   grocers
  
  , & temper & alloy it with a little white
ground in
  
   oil
  
  , for in this way, the beautiful shows its
  
   turquine
  
  vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
delicate is the best for working. It is thinned
  
   working
  
  by
washing it.
