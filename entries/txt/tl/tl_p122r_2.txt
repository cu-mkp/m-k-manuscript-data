 Flower in the mouth of the
 
  snake
 

  If you want to put in the mouth of the
  
   snake
  
  some flower
  

    q
   

  or some branch of a plant which contains the
  
   antidote
  
  against its bite, take a little branch, as best
arranged as you can find, & pose its stem into its mouth. Then put
two little pieces of
  
   wax
  
  around the stem of the plant. And with
the
  
   end of a
   

     iron
    
    wire
   
   that is hot
  
  , melt the
  
   wax
  
  a little, & with the other
  

    hand
   

  , close
the jaws of the animal. And then you can cut the head to make it burn
with the flower. If the plant
  

    s
   

  is strong enough, it
will hold up by itself, and should it be weak like
  
   wormwood
  
  leaf, which droops, the humidity of the
  
   sand
  
  will lift it up, & make
it swim & hold up without putting anything there, although you could
pass underneath it some
  
   thread
  
  , going through with a
  
   needle
  
  .
