Gemstones

Take white pebbles that are found by the rivers &amp;

among the sand bank &amp; paths, which are

somewhat transparent, &amp; if they are perfectly transparent it

will be better. If not, use the best &amp; whitest that you can. Calcine

them three or 4 times in your four à vent, &amp; extinguish

them in water or vinegar. Next, take a

℥ of them and pestle them in a

totally pure copper mortar &amp; with a pestle of

pure copper, and grind them until they become very fine

&amp; soft powder, and this is a sign that they have taken the substance

of copper, enough for giving them greenness. At that time, on your

℥ of pebbles, put in three

℥ of good minium, not adulterated by

brick &amp; anything else, and grind everything together again very

well in a bronze mortar. And on all of this, put in a

gros pour

℥ of sel de verre;

&amp; some &amp; the common people put in

e sandiver that they find at the

glassmakers' or apothecaries'. But alkali

salt, as you know, is better.

In this way, the common people make emeralds &amp; cast in

sand. If you do not have a bronze mortar, grind

with a mort in a kettle

of pure copper.

One needs to reheat crucibles before putting in materials, and

put them in the fornaise or four à

vent before making &amp; increasing the fire.

They are made in an hour &amp; a half.

A gros of salt on the four

℥ of pebbles &amp; minium. When

one says, for ℥, this is to be understood: on

one ℥ of the body, &amp; not of the

salts &amp; the minium.
