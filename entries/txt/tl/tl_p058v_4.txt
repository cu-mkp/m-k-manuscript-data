Azure

Turpentine oil renders it very beautiful. Test palma christi seed oil.
Walnut oil in Flanders costs at least a hundred
sous a pint. The azure requires a little
fatty oil because it has no body.





Azur d'esmail hates more than any other to be ground,
especially with water, for it dies & loses all its color.
However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with
water but with oil & grind it thickly, and in this
way it will not die as much.





Always choose the most delicate one.
