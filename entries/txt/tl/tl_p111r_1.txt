Reheating molds

The frames readily dry out & do not reheat. For
reheating is actually for the second time to redden &
inflame the molds in the fire, and drying out is to let the
molds dry themselves or to make their humidity evaporate by
placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one.
Noyau molds readily reheat & frame molds
dry out.
