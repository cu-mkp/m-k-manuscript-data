For whitening ceruse

Hard-boil eggs, divide them in half & take the yolk out,
& between the two halves of the white put a piece of
ceruse, & tie them together with thread. Then boil
in clear water, & it will become entirely black, & thus
the ceruse will be left well purified. Some reheat it over fire & it
becomes very white.
