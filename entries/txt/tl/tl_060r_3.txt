Oil

Walnut oil extracted like peeled

almonds is very white. The one of palma

christi. And when the oil has a little body, the

colors soften in it. For if the oil is too clear, the colors run &amp;

do not have bond, even those that hardly have any body. Fatty

oil that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for varnish.

The oil is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as

common varnish. Oils do not dry as quickly in cold

countries as in hot countries. Oil exposed to the sun

is clarified well. But it fattens, if you put in ceruse or

lead filings or lead white or calcined pulverized

pglass. To avoid this, put the vial in

clear water.

Colors in oil, once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the

second colors; to prevent this, breathe on them &amp; the color will

take there.
