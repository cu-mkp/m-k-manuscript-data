Molding turtles

The water turtle is more beautiful to mold

because it has prettier scales &amp; straight legs. And those of the

garrigue have crooked ones. They are of long

life; getting ready to put them to death, open their mouth &amp; pass a long

penknife through all the intestines, &amp; then make it swallow

some vinegar mixed with eau-de-vie or urine, as for

snakes. One needs to mold them in several pieces, &amp; the

back itself, sometimes, because the sides for some are narrower than

elsewhere &amp; are not released on this occasion. To make them die, one

ought not to boil them, for they come apart, &amp; even the shell, from the

hot water. They come out better hollow, because their great

thickness corrupts the mold. Those from

water are more vigorous. Those of the

garrigue are thinner, slower &amp; more

sleepy. If you scratch those of the water on their

shells, however sleepy they are, they move. Those of the 

garrigue do not.

They die rather quickly in

vinegar mixed with a little eau-de-vie or urine, as

with all other animals.

They keep themselves, in the

winter, with their eyes closed &amp; are as dead, being

numbed by the cold. They hide in the earth or

under wheat chaff or warm manure, &amp; live

only on the moisture of the earth.

One ought not to mold them as soon as they are dead because they are still too

stiff. But on the follwing day, you will manipulate them &amp;

fold their legs as you wish.
