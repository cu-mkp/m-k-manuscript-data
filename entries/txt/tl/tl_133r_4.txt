Clamps and broken mold

When you have made the first reheating &amp; removed the

clamps, and you have the opened your mold

to clean it by blowing with quicksilver, which is used only in

enclosed molds, close the mold again &amp; put the

clamps on again, but not in the first place where they were.

Lute again &amp; dry again. But if it is for a cast with

silver or gold, lute with the remainder of the sand

that was used, for it is the safest. If your mold, while

reheating, is broken, you can adjust it with some clamps &amp;

lute.
