Defense of a town

There is nothing that has a greater effect for the defense of a

breach than petards placed at the entryway at the time of the assault.

They carry a lot of ammunition. be One fills them

with cart nails, large steel dice, bits of chain

&amp; similar things. And when one senses that the enemies are close,

one sets fire to all. Grenades, too, well-made and aptly thrown, cause

great damage. And to make them worse, one puts coarsely

pestling pestled glass either in the molds or in the

crucible, when one wants to cast them; this worsens the wounds.

The grenades ought not to be too brittle. But it is good that they be

somewhat alloyed with the substance of the pieces in order that,

holding the blast a little rather than breaking, they have more

violence.
