Perspective

To know the point, one needs to lay down a ruler over the
lines, & at the intersection of these, the point will
be. Some make a hole at the end of their
rulers to fix the point by that hole & move the
ruler about. Others lay down a ruler across the panel,
then on this laid-down ruler they set the tip of another
ruler, which, attached to the former by means of a screw,
moves about & reaches as far as necessary without losing the point.
    
The ruler and compass without the judgement of the
eye cause errors.
Perspective is very difficult.






To paint perspective in oil, you ought not to use a
ruler, for you would smudge everything. But when layering your
colors you need to keep to the & follow the lines of your
first drawing.





To make plumb lines also, which go from the top
to make vif to the bottom of the panel,
you need to have a thread with some piece of lead
attached to one end & a little hook to the other for
hanging the said thread from the top of the panel.
