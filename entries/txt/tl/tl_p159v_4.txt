  Plaster
 
 alone
 
  Reheated
  
   stone plaster
  

   fears
  
  is undone in
  
   water
  
  , but that which is
  
   reheated &
  
  first
pulverized and then reheated does not fear it. But if it is good, it
hardens in it, like
  
   the one of
   
    Paris
   
   &
   
    Spain
   

  , which is hard in
  
   stone
  
  , as is that which
grows in
  
   lean & dry earth
  
  and which seems like
  
   white salt
  
  .
  
   Germans
  
  make statues for their
  
   fountains
  
  with it, which are not spoiled, especially once varnished, but it hardens in
  
   water
  
  . When it is alone & not mixed, it sets more quickly than otherwise. One needs to
  
   oil
  
  very lightly
your
  
   molds
  
  that are of
  
   metal
  
  or
  
   stone
  
  , otherwise it would
not release. And however you
  
   oil
  
  , you have to temper it with
  
   hot
water
  
  . And when it has set & well cooled, one
needs to wet it sometimes in
  
   cold water
  
  , but if it refuses to
open, in
  
   hot water
  
  & sometimes in
  
   boiling water
  
  .
 

  Sometimes one even needs to make the
  
   mold
  
  boil in
  
   hot
water
  
  , as when you have molded some
  
   wax
  
  that you fear would
not be easily released from it.
  



   Cold water
  
  makes
  
   oil
  
  withdraw to the surface of the
  
   plaster
  
  that has sucked it in, & thus it releases.
