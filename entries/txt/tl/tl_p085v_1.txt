They mix beaten glair of egg with earth with which they make
the first layer of the cope of pieces, & bells, & all
other pieces, saying that the said glair makes it come out
<-d-> neatly, & lays down & settles the
substance. En noyau for a small work, glair is also
good.

Rosette, to come out neatly, wants the mold
to be a little hot, & lead which has also been mixed with the
rosette, especially for small pieces.
