Mold made in two casts

It is opened, once reheated, to clean it; next, one puts the

clamps on again, one lutes the mold &amp;

especially the joints, then one slowly dries the earth. And then,

as it no longer smokes, one leaves the mold to cool until you can

hold it without harm. Next, put in the presses or in the sand

in a terrine, &amp; cast in tin. For if you

were to cast in silver or gold, it would be necessary that

your mold be reheated twice &amp; cast when it would be completely 

red.

If your mold f, through the fault of the

plaster, retracts in the fire, you need to open it

after the first reheating to tighten it again, &amp; clamp it

and lute again, and tighten again.
