Rock & grotto

One needs to pestle white & yellow marcasites &
diverse kinds of minerals, & then wash them well, in
order that the earthy & powdery part is cleaned & there remains
only the lustrous grain of the mineral, with which you will
sprinkle your rock previously covered with strong glue, 
if your <-fatty-> grotto is
<-r-> not for a fountain & for touching
water, and you will have a nice work.
