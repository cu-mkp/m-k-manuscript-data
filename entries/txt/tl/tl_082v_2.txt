Casting lead in lead

There are some who make their hollow forms with thick lead, then

cast lead in them.

Lead when not cast hot enough, is white, &amp; blacker when cast

well hot.

One can make a lead mold, &amp; to cast in it, smoke

it with candle black. But it is never that neat.

Never does lead come so neat as tin.
