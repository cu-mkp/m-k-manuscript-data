For making blood or wine issue from

someoneâ€™s forehead or from a wall

    

Take a funnel or funnel of fer blanc which is double-walled in the body d

but not in the spout. Make a small hole at the top edge &amp;

au another, slightly bigger, on the inner wall that

will be a little above the spout, just as you can see in the adjacent

example. Then when you want to use it, put in wine

or liquid rosette of Brazilwood or black cherry

juice, and blocking the hole of the spout the with your

little finger, make sure that the funnel is well

filled in order that the wine can enter there between the

double walls through the hole at the side, &amp; if it does not enter

well, making it seem as if you are tasting the wine,

suck &amp; draw in a little air, drinking where the little hole

is. Next, make one of the close bystanders drink the rest of

the wine or cast it aside or let it flow through the tip, but

before, you must have pressed your thumb well over the hole on

the top edge, because in this way, by the compression of air, the

wine will be retained between the double walls. Then with a

bodkin rounded at the tip &amp; that goes into its handle, you

make it seem as if you pierce the forehead of someone who holds

a glass in his hand, and while you pierce, you

cover what you are doing with the funnel that you hold

close to #

#

his forehead. Then removing your thumb from over the

hole on the top edge, the air, being free, will make the

wine issue from between the double walls through the hole marked

B, &amp; fall through the tip marked C into the glass.

But you must make the fellow bend his head enough in

order to do it well.
