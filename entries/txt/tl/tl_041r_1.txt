Earth for casting, for founders

It renders itself fatty once beaten and also mixed with

horse dung. Potterâ€™s earth would be

too fatty and would crack &amp; would not hold in the fire, but one needs

to mix it with half as much sand and a quarter

or a fifth of horse dung. And leave

it to dry, then turn it to powder, then sift it to render it fine &amp;

purged of gravel, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The dung

renders the earth more amiable &amp; tractable, but it

is necessary that it be well free of straw &amp; other things.

And when the earth is very fatty, one needs to give it more sand

&amp; more dung. But one does find fatty earths,

in and of themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, do it by artifice.

One always needs to reheat the earths before casting.
