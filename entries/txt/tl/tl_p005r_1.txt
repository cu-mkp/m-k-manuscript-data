  Steel
 
 mirrors
 

   X
  


  They are called of
  
   steel
  
  because in times
past they were commonly made of
  
   steel
  
  polished with
  

    emery putty
   

  . But more easily, various kinds are made
with
  


     cuivre franc
    


  , which is
  
   rosette
  
  &
  
   tin
  
  , because it is cast in a
  
   mold
  
  & made
round, concave, convex & however one likes, to represent various
forms.
 

  So take
  
   half
  

   rosette copper
  
  &
  
   half
  


    soft tin
   

  , that is to say fine, which has not yet been used.
Put them in a
  
   crucible
  
  , & first melt the
  
   copper
  
  well. And once it is well melted, put in the
  
   tin
  
  and mix
together. Then cast in the
  
   mold, of
   
    white stone
   
   with no
eyelets
  
  , & anoint the
  
   mold
  
  with
  
   oil
  
  , & let
it be moderately warm. Then, having
  
   molded
  
  your mirror, you can polish it in this way.
 

  Set one of these in
  
   plaster
  
  in order that it holds firmly,
& then put the other one over it with
  

    thin sand
   

  in between,
& rub one against the other, whether it be concave or flat, & thus you
will polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides,
you only need to switch them, that is to say put the one that was
polishing into the
  
   plaster
  
  & the one that was in the
  
   plaster
  
  to polish. After having polished them with the
  


     arene
    


  you can smooth them with
  


     Venice
    
    tripoli
   

  , 
which should not be sandy, & next with
  

    putty
   

  . You polish with
  


     arene
    


  using
  
   water
  
  , but polishing with
  

    tripoli
   

  &
  

    putty
   

  is done
dry. Once polished, you can set it.
