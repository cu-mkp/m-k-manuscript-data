 Borders of a
 
  garden
 

  One needs to work the earth, then make it thinner with the
  
   rake
  
  . And next, if it is dry, one needs to moisten it. Then,
stretch the
  
   cord
  
  very close, and hit on the entire
length of the
  
   cord
  


    as
   

  with the back
of a
  
   pruning knife
  
  , in order that the
  
   cord
  
  marks a straight line, the
  
   length
  
  of which you will make
  
   a
border
  
  holes with an
  

    iron
   
   stake
  
  where you
will plant your
  
   rosemary
  
  . Behead & cut to measure, and
prune from the bottom up.
