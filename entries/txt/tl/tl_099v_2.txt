They are very difficult to bore when they are of
metal because the substance is brittle &amp; frangible. But one
z ought not to push the borer with too

cannon bigger than the ball in order to avoid the necessity of
boring, because the substance is cast &amp; expands &amp;
pushes the mold. If the borer, which should be neither like a swallow
tail nor a point but be cut in the round like a wimble, if it breaks, one ought not to leave it there to rust

but immediately take it out of the touch-hole. This
you will do by pouring a little oil on it; then,
l turn the place of the touch-hole downward &amp;
strike the opposite side of the piece, &amp; it will fall down. One
needs to bore gently &amp; at ease when the piece is of
metal.
