Crocum ferri

It is much sooner made with iron rust than with
filings. For if the vinegar is good, you will
see it boil with large bubbles <-as if it-> on the rust,
as if it were on the fire; on the filings, it does not boil
unless it is put on the fire or hot ashes. However, when the
filings are passed through vinegar, & you have made it
evaporate & heat up, & it is very red, if you do this again for a
second time, the vinegar will have much more strength, & the
crocum will only be finer for it, & redder. Those who
use it to cast in gold <-ven-> buy the
ounce for forty or fifty sous.





It does not harden the molds, and, in scraping, one cannot tell
that they are harder from it. But it makes the mold less dense,
and it drinks in and attracts the gold better.
