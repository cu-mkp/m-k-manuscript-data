Varnish on paper

The Germans make boxes p covered with painted
paper &amp; varnish it with glair of egg mixed with
gum &amp; a little oil, not of spike
lavender, but another fragrant one that resembles
olive oil. Every work done with glair
supports oil. It is with this that painters trick the
poor peasants, painting their bands of taffeta with
this glair, to be done sooner. But the first rain
carries away everything.
