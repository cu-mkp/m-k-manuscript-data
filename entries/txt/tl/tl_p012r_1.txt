 For molding
 
  sulfur
 


   Sulfur
  
  is made beautiful mixed with
  
   soot black
  
  or with
  
   pulverized sanguine
  
  , which renders it harder and stronger. Having
let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like
  
   oil
  
  , mix it with
  
   verdigris
  
  , and you
  

    m
   

  will very neatly cast in
  
   plaster
  
  a
  
   lizard
  
  or something else.
 

  One ought not to cast unless it is well cooled & unless it
has lost all its pustules & bubbles, and has settled down
well & become smooth like
  




   water
  
  . The
  
   soot black
  
  gives it a fine sheen & makes it neater. The most
beautiful yellow
  
   sulfur
  
  must be used, for the greyish &
lively one is not good. Do not cast
  
   in wind
  
  &
  
   in cold
  
  , for it would become porous.
