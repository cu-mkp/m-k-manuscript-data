Advice concerning the gate

Ne Be careful to not make your gate very wide, and do not
forget to make in its conduit two or three holes and notches, &amp; as
your gate approaches the ch molded thing, divide it
into three or four parts like fingers which are pointed &amp;
are not very deep. For the metal runs more gently without being
hindered by vapors &amp; fumes.



Always make the entry of your gate near the medal notched &amp; lumpy,
to draw out the fury of the metal.
