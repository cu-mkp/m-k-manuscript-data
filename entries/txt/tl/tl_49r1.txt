Casting of lead

Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of
churches, <-in it-> melt <-one-> for one
lb of tin a half of lead, &
cast in stone, & if they want their work whiter, they put
<-p-> half tin and half lead, but
the first mixture is the best, & does not become porous. One needs
to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke
their molds with a resin candle to cast neatly. The
antimony makes the substance brittle & breakable. The
looking-glass tin makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as
for tin, it works well <-to the-> with pure lead.
Those who make very neat lead casts, use puncheon.
Pewterers cast in a copper mold. One says
that one makes lead take hold on glass with
resin. Some put into the lead a quarter of
tin. Looking-glass tin  renders the work stronger.
