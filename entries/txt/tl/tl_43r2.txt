White bronzing on plaster

One needs to give four layers of paintersâ€™ distemper glue
on the plaster portrait, always leaving each layer to
dry. Next, with minium from England  ground on marble, or
burnt lead, grind <-av-> & temper with a bit of
gum or <-go-> glue, & coat lightly. Once
dry, rub lightly with a little cotton and the plaster
portrait will seem to be of lead. Others grind minium with
quicksilver.
