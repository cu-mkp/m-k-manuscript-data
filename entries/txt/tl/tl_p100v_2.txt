again very well, then add in iii â„¥ of
minium, & pestle well again all together, & put
it in the crucible, which you will cover with an appropriate
tile, a bit thick, in order that heat reverberates better
there. Then, set it on the grate of your furnace,
having put under a few thick rounded squares. Next, fill your
furnace to the opening with charcoal, so that it will
be heaped, and let it kindle, and always maintain the heat evenly
without letting the charcoal decrease. And for this effect,
always make it so that the furnace is heaped & full of
charcoal, and maintain it thus for one day.
The first experience that I made of it, it only returned a yellow mass,
as is vitrified minium alone, & some grains of
gold in a mass at the bottom. Try cemented gold
and accompanied with antimony.





If you need greater heat, <-plie-> put, on the edge of
the opening of the glowing furnace, tiles, one against
the other, for making the heat reverberate.
