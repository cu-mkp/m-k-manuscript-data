Mathematical figures without ruler and compass



You know how to draw a circle correctly with the quill &amp; or
else with the nail of your right thumb &amp; the bent
big finger. If you do not have a ruler, fold
paper in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw
a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly without a compass,
fold your paper such that the fold e gives
you a straight line, at the required distance from which, trace
a point &amp; a or a line &amp; saturate it well with
ink. Then fold again the paper &amp; rub it on the back
    &amp; 
 it will print however much you have made. In that way la
l, A is the line without ink which the paper
fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is
printed.
