 For keeping
 
  candles
 
 from dripping and making them white
 
  Having made them, put into the
  
   mold
  

   fresh water
  
  well
beaten with
  
   bran
  
  , which should not at all be purged of its
  
   flour
  
  , so that the
  
   water
  
  becomes white. And dip your
  
   candles
  
  in that, then leave them to dry. And do thus two or three
times.
