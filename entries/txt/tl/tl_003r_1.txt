One needs to first make the branches of wood or take a

bizarre thorn branch, then melt a lb of the most

beautiful clear pitch resin and put in one ounce of

subtly ground vermilion with walnut oil, and if

you add in a little Venice laque platte, the

color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the resin melted

over a charcoal fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. 

Next dip in your branches while turning, &amp; if any filaments

should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of the

charcoal.

Colophony is nothing other than recooked resin. To do

it well, take a leaded pot &amp; melt the resin,

&amp; boil it over the brazier a good hour,

&amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid like

water, &amp; easily runs &amp; flows from the tip of a

stick with which you grind it, &amp; test it. Then pour it

through a coarse canvas or a very light tammy

cloth, such that when pouring it falls into the

strongest vinegar that you can find, for the vinegar gives

it strength &amp; prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two

or three times &amp; it will be beautiful &amp; well purified. For

counterfeiting your coral, you can mix a quarter part of

mastic into your purified resin to render it more firm

and more beautiful, &amp; if you were to take a single tear of

mastic, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.

Sulfur &amp; vermilion makes the same effect.

The coral made of gules red enamel endures the

file and polishing.

It is made like cement that is stronger mixed with pestled

than of glass rather than with brick. Thus, here one

mixes well pestled gules red enamel, which

is red in body, with the vermilion. Thus with all colors of

enamels.
