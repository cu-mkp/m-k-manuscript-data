  Fatty earth
 


   Founders
  
  , to make the handles of their bells, use it. And
before it is used, they beat it very well, then leave it to dry
  
   in
the shade
  
  , little by little & for a
  
   long time
  
  , and mold with
it very neatly. But it must not be sandy
  
   &
  
  , but rather well chosen & soft.
