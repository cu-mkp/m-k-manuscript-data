Counterproofing

Make some soap water &amp; with this, rub &amp; moisten the

intaglio piece that you want to counterproof, then lay white

paper on it &amp; rub very vigorously across the top with a

tooth or the bottom of a glass &amp; you will

transfer your printed piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but

if you oil your paper with spike lavender

&amp;or turpentine oil, it will represent

from the left the right on the other side. Then follow

these lines with a paintbrush or a quill, then heat the

paper &amp; the oil will go away &amp; leave your

paper white. And if you want this not to be known, if by chance,

you borrowed the piece, moisten the paper, and the polishing that

the burnisher has made on the back, which shows what has been

done, will not be known. The soap water will turn the piece

yellow, but well-gummed water, which has the same effect, does

not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make gummed

water, then mix some soap in it &amp; do as is said.
