Glassmakersâ€™ white sand from the
mine, mixed with sal ammoniac

There is found in Cominge, near the town of
Aurignac, a sand white mai like
salt and lean, that glassmakers &
potters use, which becomes impalpable ground on
porphyry & is easy to grind. And once ground, it
resembles calcined alabaster. It molds very neatly, and I have
not found any that molds as delicately as this one for lowf relief. It is
excellent to mold en noyau without a frame, having ground it
impalpable with gummed or pure water on porphyry,
then placing it, thick as mustard or a little more, on the medal,
anointed lightly with oil either of olive, walnut, or even
better spike lavender. But to do it better
mo, let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or
two days. Although, if you are in a hurry, you can
heat it well, & it will not crack if it is not put on too lightly.
It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes
some holes & pustules, which it does not do when dried in the cold or
at ease rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it & it will
withstand several casts.
