   shell of
   
    crabs

    crayfish
   

  are
awkward to burn, & there is a proper fashion of molding them.
 


   Rats
  
  &
  
   birds
  
  can be molded, and the feet are
awkward to extract when burnt because they are small & delicate.
The bodies are extracted more easily from the

are cast in many

  pieces.
