Fatty colors

If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
colors have penetrated, it means that this place is fatty, &amp; that
the second colors one layers on would not take easily, unless
you rub this place with soap or breathe on it, because the
humidity will make the colors take.




One cannot layer oil on cut paper &amp; model as in
distemper because the color would run. Thus, to gild with
or mat, one needs to pounce &amp; then layer the gold
color with the paintbrush.




All fatty colors, such as ceruse and minium,
massicot, ocher, lead white, are good for making
gold color.




Every color or thing that becomes dense when water is put in during the
grinding has body. But those which do not have it, such as
pestled glass, lake, &amp;c, become clear.
