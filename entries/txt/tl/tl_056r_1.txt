Excellent tempering bath for cuirass bodies

Take river water, as clear &amp; running as
possible, &amp; heat it to a little more than tepid. Then take a bunch
of weld, &amp; take the grain of it &amp; put it into
the said water &amp; boil it thoroughly, stirring it with a stick, then pour it into a
muid or other vessel, then throw into it two
pecks of salt. 

Next, take a big cauldron of the said
river water &amp; heat it to a litte more than
tepid. &amp; take three or four double handfuls of
fatty red earth, soak it &amp; throw it into the cauldron
with the said water. Take as much pigeon dung
as the said earth, &amp; as much horse
dung, &amp; as much iron filings, &amp; mix the
whole separately, &amp; throw it into the cauldron &amp; leave
it for two or three days. Then throw it afterward
into the said muid and stir the whole thoroughly together. And
the older this temper is, the better it will be.
