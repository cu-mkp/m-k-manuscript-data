Crayfish

The hairy cornicles that it has under its beak
coe tend to come out lumpy & not neat because,
being burnt, it is difficult to remove them & clean their
ash, which, staying in the mold, it prevents
the metal from running well therein, & for that reason, one
makes a small gate of wax thread at the tips of them, both to
hold them up and to blow out the ash that hinders.



Spare no pins, placing them not only in the middle of the body
but also on the big legs, and two or three at the tail, according to the
stance that you want to give it.
