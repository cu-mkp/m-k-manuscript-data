Molded roses



They are awkward to mold because the petals are very fine & weak
& doubled. But, to obl avoid this, one needs to
anoint them with wheat oil, which is very dessicative. And having
quickly dried, it firms & stiffens the petals to be able to separate
them & withstand the tempered sand. The same is done with flies,
with pansies & similar delicate things, with flowers from
the caper plant.
