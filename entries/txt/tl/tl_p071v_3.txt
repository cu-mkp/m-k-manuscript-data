  Spider
 

  In
  
   Ireland
  
  , there are none, & if one touches them
with
  

    wood
   

  that is there, they die. This is why some
  
   rich
  
  people of
  
   England
  
  make their ceilings from this
  
   wood
  
  , & by this method, they never have cobwebs
&
  
   spider
  
  webs.
