Curried steel and files

The steel that farriers & iron
workers commonly use is not refined like that from
Germany or Biscay, which is reduced in hardness
<-p-> in the bath of molten iron, but
<-only-> in the iron bars which are transported in flat
ingots from the forges of Foix & elsewhere,
there is a harder & whiter & finer kind than the other, as it
comes from the mine. And the workers choose it
& use it like the other steel. And because [<-that->] it comes from
common iron, they call it strong iron. But it is not as
excellent as purified steel like that from Germany &
Biscaye, which is sold in small beads. Some curry
steel, giving it a heating, then temper it <-&
water-> in a large quantity of water, then forge it.
& fine steel, which is brittle, breaks and crumbles, &
iron allows itself to be stretched. Thus they separate the
finest steel, <-&-> which with another heating they
reduce to a mass. The Germans make their files from
strong iron.

One applies steel to tools
<-dess-> not on both sides, but underneath the part
where one sharpens & whets them. & in this part, they must be of
very soft iron.

Levantines refine our
steel because their country does not provide them with any. And
they reheat it in a pot with bitumen, &c.
