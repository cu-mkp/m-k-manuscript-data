For whitening ceruse

Hard-boil eggs, divide them in half &amp; take the yolk out,
&amp; between the two halves of the white put a piece of
ceruse, &amp; tie them together with thread. Then boil
in clear water, &amp; it will become entirely black, &amp; thus
the ceruse will be left well purified. Some reheat it over fire &amp; it
becomes very white.
