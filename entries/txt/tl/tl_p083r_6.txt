   Alabaster calcined
  
  in a
  

    crucible
   

  over
  
   charcoal
  
  fire, so that, touching it, it turns into powder. Once

    cellar
   


   cellar
  
  or a
  
   humid
place
  
  . And with this paste, mold what you will need, & next
dry the
  
   mold
  
  in the fire, & cast whichever
  
   metal
  
  you wish, while
the
  
   sand
  
  is hot; & you will cast as neatly as the principal,
  

  &
the
  
   sand
  
  can still be used by placing it in a
  
   humid place
  
  & drying it in the fire.
