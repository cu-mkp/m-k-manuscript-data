 Cast of
 
  tin
 

  If the plant or flower that you want to cast
  
   in
   
    tin
   

  is
delicate & fine, it is necessary that the
  
   tin
  
  exceeds the
  
   lead
  
  in the mixture, & on the contrary, if it is thick, it is
necessary that the
  
   lead
  
  exceeds. Therefore, for the
  
   mixture
  
  fine thing, put in some
  
   fine tin
  
  , not at all the
  
   quarter
part
  
  of
  
   lead
  
  . And make sure that your
  
   mold
  
  is
  
   hottish, such that you can hold it in your
   

     hand
    


  when you want to cast. As for the
  
   alloyed tin
  
  , the same as mentioned, it is necessary that it is
very hot & almost red for casting, so that it penetrates. Otherwise,
having
  
   to
  
  run the length of the fine branches of
the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And do not forget to
mix in it a little
  
   looking-glass tin
  
  , which makes it run better
& firms it up.
 

  In the
  
   lead alloyed with tin
  
  , or
  
   tin alloyed with lead
  
  ,
you can put a little bit of
  

    metalline
   

  , & it will seem
  
   silver
  
  . But do not put too much, for this hardens the substance
& sours it also, so that for a delicate thing like legs &
similar things, it would not be appropriate.
