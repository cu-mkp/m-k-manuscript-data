 For unspiking a
 
  cannon
 

  Some say that one should remove the ball if the
  
   cannon
  
  is loaded
& give fire through the mouth of the
  
   cannon
  
  . But it is to be
believed that the fire would sooner exit that way than going to seek its
exit through its usual touch-hole which is
spiked & constrained. The most reliable way is that the
  
   gunner
  
  , who is often a
  
   founder
  
  , wedges &
thoroughly rivets the
  
   nail
  
  that the enemies placed, and with a
  
   trepan
  
  makes
  
   at the side
  
  another touch-hole next to
the one which has been spiked, which will be done in an hour. And if
with time the violence of the
  
   powder
  
  loosens the
  
   nail
  
  with
which the
  
   piece
  
  is spiked, you will make a
  
   thread
  
  in the second
touch-hole & place a
  
   screw
  
  in it quite perfectly which will
never come undone.
