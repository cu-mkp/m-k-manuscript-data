Molding Ã  noyau figures of wax or medals of

lead

Rub them with oil with a paintbrush, but let

it be so lightly that your medal is almost rubbed dry &amp; that it

hardly appears to have been anointed. Next, destr rub

it with eau-de-vie and heat the water with which you will

temper your aforesaid sand, with plaster, brick &amp;

alum, in order that being chau as if lukewarm

when you cast it, the oil will not refuse it, as it does with

cold water, &amp; do not forget when moistening your sand to

always mix in it a little sal ammoniac.

Medals mold in such a way very neatly.
