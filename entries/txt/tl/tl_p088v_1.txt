Sand from pulverized rock salt and sand from the
mine finely ground on marble 

The one and the other, once very finely ground on
marble, after having thoroughly pestled them dry & beaten
in the mortar, I mixed as much of one as the other, and having
reworked them together on porphyry & passed them
through a double sieve or through the sleeve of a
shirt to mix<- s-> them even better, I put them in paper
& put them on a marble in a cellar. In
one night, they had been wet enough by
themselves without moistening them further, because rock salt, like
all other salts, dissolves in the humidity. I molded very
neatly with it, because both were very finely ground. They want to be
<-f-> humid enough to release well.
