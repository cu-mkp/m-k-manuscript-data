Base gold from Germany,
electrum

One calls it gold from the Rhine, which one finds
in the rivers, and is spangle gold.
Goldsmiths from Germany wanted to refine it,
thinking to separate it from this whiteness which they deemed to be
silver. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that
this whiteness is fixed & it does not lack color. This is
electrum, from which one is able to make cups,
which will demonstrate poison.
