Molds

Even though you cast in lead, the molds want to be well

dried, especially when they are large, and one needs to redden them on

the outside &amp; keep them in continuous heat until they no longer

smoke from inside. Do not place them to reheat at different

times, but continue once you have started. And do not place them

to cool in the cold, With for they would crack,

but leave them to become lukewarm near the fire, &amp; when they are still of such a heat as you have noticed before by putting

your finger in the hole, cast. And when the

mold is large, it needs more time to reheat &amp; dry, &amp; one

needs to cast hotter.
