 Molding and shrinking a large figure
 




  Mold it with
  
   bread pith
  
  coming from the
  
   oven
  
  , or
as the aforesaid, & in drying out, it will shrink & consequently the
medal that you will cast in it. You
  
   it
  
  can, by this means, by
elongating and widening the imprinted
  
   bread pith
  
  , vary the figure
& with one image make many various ones.
  
   Bread
  
  coming from
the
  
   oven
  
  is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts
more. You can cast
  
   sulfur
  
  without leaving the imprint of the
  
   bread
  
  to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you
want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.
