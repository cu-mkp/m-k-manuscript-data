 Molding
 
  If you want to promptly mold something in half relief that
comes to hand, fold some
  

    paper
   

  in five or six doubles,
& place it on the
  
   medal
  
  & make sure the
  

    paper
   

  is folded on the back of the
  
   medal
  
  so
that it is well secured. Next, take a
  
   stick
  
  , broad at one end
& pointed at the other, well smoothed, and rub well on the
  

    paper
   

  , & with the point of the
  
   stick
  
  retrace
the lines & proceed until you recognize that your imprint is well
done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub
  
   oil
  
  with a
  
   paintbrush
  


    lemp
   

  on the
  

    paper
   

  imprint and cast in
  
   tallow
  
  or
  
   wax
  
  or
  
   sulfur
  
  , & the
  

    paper
   

  , without
burning, will render your portrait neat, which you will afterward be able to
mold in
  
   plaster
  
  or
  
   tripoli
  
  , and then in
  
   lead
  
  & other
  
   metal
  
  .
 

  Polished
  


     carton
    


  of little thickness & a little
moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with
  

    paper
   

  glued on the back.
