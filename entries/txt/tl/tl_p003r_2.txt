  Varnish
 
 for panels
 
  Take a
  
   lb
  
  of
  

    Venice
   
   turpentine
  
  & heat
it in a
  
   pot
  
  until it simmers, and put in half a
  
   lb
  
  of
the
  
   turpentine oil
  
  of the whitest you can find, and stir it
together well on a
  
   charcoal
  
  fire and take it off immediately. And
  

    elle
   

  it is done. But if it seems too thick to you,
add in a little more
  
   oil
  
  . Similarly if it is too clear, you can
thicken it by putting in a little
  
   turpentine
  
  . Thus you will give it
whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when
heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings
and other painted things without corrupting the colors or yellowing. And
it dries both
  
   in the shade
  
  and
  
   in the sun
  
  , and
  
   overnight
  
  , and
  
   during the winter
  
  as well as
  
   in the summer
  
  . It is commonly sold 15
  
   sous
  
  a
  
   lb
  
  .
 

  A little more
  
   turpentine
  
  than
  
   turpentine oil
  
  is needed in
order to give body to the
  
   varnish
  
  , which needs to be applied with
the
  

    finger
   

  in order to spread it thinner and less thick,
for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not
  
   varnish
  
  to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out
of them.
 



  But it is used to heighten colors which have soaked in and to keep them
from dust.
  
   Mastic varnish
  
  does not resist
  
   rain
  
  ,
whereas that of
  
   oil
  
  and
  
   rosin
  
  does.
