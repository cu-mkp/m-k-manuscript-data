For gilding on wood

First one needs to put down a layer of very clear glue, and
once dry, you will put down a layer of yellow gold. And when it is
done, you will take fig tree wood, &amp; put it to soak
some space of time, &amp; wash the places you want to gild, and
cut your gold with a knife to the price that you will
lay. And one must lay the said gold with 
iecotton. 
And if you can find a fig tree,
take the the white of one egg &amp; stir it vigorously.



If your gold does not have beautiful enough color, you will take
a partridge feather, &amp; make it burn in a
chafing-dish, and make the smoke go against what you have
gilded.
