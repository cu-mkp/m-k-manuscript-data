Plaster

That from the mountains is greyer, and the the
one from the region of Albi is whiter. It must be cooked with a
closed fire, such as a reverberatory furnace or barbers'
ovens. And the most freshly cooked is the best to put to use.
One needs to finely grind it on marble. After having prepared your
hollow form from sulfur or something else, &amp; having oiled it
&amp; enclosed it in a circle, temper not too
thickly your plaster with water, &amp; separate it well
with your finger, and if it makes pustules, throw on top
more powder of the said plaster &amp;  grind it
with the finger until +




+ it makes no more pustules. Then cast &amp; sprinkle
once again with plaster powder &amp; let it take well, then
scrape the powder.
