Making copper and latten run

Put in at the end, when it is very hot & when you want to cast,
sal ammoniac & saltpeter, which removes filth
& heats it. Mix some ardides with the latten.
 Guard against the metal touching the iron or the
latten of the frame, but cover it with sand or
lute. Do the casting very evenly.
