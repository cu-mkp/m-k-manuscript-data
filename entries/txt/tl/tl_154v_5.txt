Strawberries

The leaves are cast separately &amp; then are joined with

solder. And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid,

&amp; by that means is heavy, and the tin stem which is delicate

will not be able to hold it up without soon breaking, one makes the

stems with latten wire &amp; then one solders &amp; joins

them.
