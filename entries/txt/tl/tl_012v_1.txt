Molding stucco promptly

Grind &amp; pulverize finely brick or Armenian

bole or sanguine &amp; incorporate it with melted wax,

&amp; thus melted, cast like the others on a relief medal,

&amp; thus you will have a hollow form where you will be able to cast with

plaster, pestled paper, or terre chimol√©e.

Finely sieved brick is better, because the bole is too

fatty.
