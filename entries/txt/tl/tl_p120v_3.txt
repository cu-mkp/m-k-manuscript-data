 Making
 
  silver
 
 run
 


  If it is for a large work,
  
   arsenic
  
  &
  
   tartar
  
  , pulverized & thrown on the
  
   melted silver
  
  , makes it run
  
   If it is
   
    pou
   

  and suffices. But for fine work, one needs some
  

    æs ustum
   

  ,
  
   filings of
   
    latten
   
   of
   
    thin copper
   
   ,
   

     u
    



   antimony, sublimate, finely pulverized
  
  .
  
   This
  
  From this gets made a mass that does not sour. If the
  

    s
   


   plaster
  
  is good, one ought
not to add
  

    crocum
   

  for
  
   silver
  
  , but one puts more
  
   feather alum
  
  .
  

  It needs also some melted
  
   common
salt
  
  & some
  
   saltpeter
  
  with the aforesaid drugs:
  
   arsenic
  
  ,
  
   tartar
  
  ,
  

    æs ustum
   

  ,
  
   copper
filings
  
  ,
  
   antimony
  
  &c.
