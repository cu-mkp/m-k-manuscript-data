For making yellow varnish

Take some gum arabic &amp; tr soak it

with water, then take some well beaten saffron, &amp;

temper the said gum, and make it quite clear, then make your ground

layer on that which you want to varnish, &amp; let it dry, &amp; when it

is dry give another ground layer of the same, &amp; let it dry as before

until it is dry enough. Then take varnish from an

apothecary, dash by blows, one quite far from the other.

Then wash your hands quite well &amp; with your

palm spread your varnish.
