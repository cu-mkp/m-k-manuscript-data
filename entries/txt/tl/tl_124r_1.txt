Animals with hair and fragile and very thin flowers

Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hair is raised
&amp; is represented as though mixed up &amp; to clumped
together. Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative
&amp; that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is
wheat oil, with which you will anoint it. Once cast, you
will be able to repair it. The bodies of butterflies and
plants that have a stem &amp; leaves which are wooly with a certain
capricious &amp; downy hair, also need to be anointed with the same
oil, to keep this down flat; likewise flowers that have
very delicate &amp; thin leaves, for dry wheat oil makes
them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called
dandelion or a pappus, which comes from the
seeds of burdock &amp; flies away at the slightest sigh of
wind.
