  Mortars
 

  It
  


     s
    


  is necessary that they be of the finest substance possible, such
as
  
   copper for cauldrons
  
  , which is better than
  
   rosette
  
  , in order that it withstands the blow better.
 

  Also the
  
   mortars
  
  for
  
   pestling
  
  are stronger & less in
danger of breaking if they are of
  
   fine copper
  
  . And for a
  
   private home
  
  , they do not
  
   ring
  
  so much & do not
carry as much
  
   noise
  
  as those of
  

    metal
   

  .
  

  It is true that those that are
of
  

    metal
   

  have more of a
  
   ring
  
  for the
  
   apothecaries
  
  .
 


   Grenades
  
  must be of
  
   fine
   
    metal
   

  .
