  Molds
 
 of things that do not release
 
  Animals that do not release can only be molded in two
  
   molds
  
  , which should not be opened until after they are well
reheated & the enclosed animal is well burned. Animals that have
bones or scales, which do not reduce into powder but rather remain as
calcined lumps, will never leave through the gate, whatever blowing
one does or whatever
  
   quicksilver
  
  one puts there, or a
  

    feather
   
   quill
  
  during molding to use as a gate. This is why one
molds in two halves, in order that, the
  
   mold
  
  being opened after
having been reheated, the burned thing can be cleaned out well. But take
heed to let it cool well, in order that, when removing the
  
   clamps
  
  , being hot, and when it is most frangible, something
does not break. The
  
   crust
  
  &
  
   ashes
  
  that it leaves &
which adhere to the
  
   mold
  
  while it is hot are removed better
once cold. Note also that on the bottom side of the
  
   mold
  
  , when
you reheat, the animal which boils leaves some
  
   filth
  
  . And, on
this occasion, one always marks the
  
   mold
  
  where the back of the
animal is, in order that, when reheating, it is above & on top &
that through this means it is neater.
