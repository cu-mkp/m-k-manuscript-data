For molding thin

After you have molded en noyau la
the first e figur mold, let it dry well
before taking away the figure of wax, in order in order
that the mold does not corrupt. Next, make a small lasagna of
paste of such thickness as you would like, and having anointed
with butter your the hollow of your first hollow
mold, adapt the paste to it, and then make your second
mold on top. If you were to anoint with oil, it would be
absorbed & would not be as appropriate as butter.
