 Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other
 
  It is necessary to cast two pieces of
  
   copper
  
  ,
  
   latten
  
  or
similar
  
   metal
  
  , very neatly, and then when you have molded the
hollow form in the
  
   sand
  
  , leave the figure of
  
   metal
  
  that you
  


     s
    


  have molded in the
  
   frame
  
  , without moving it
from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a
little & push the figure down in the
  
   frame
  
  .
 

  It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the
  
   filth
  
  &
  
   grime
  
  accumulate. And, in this way, if you
were mold the face toward the cast, some
  
   grime
  
  could be found
there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
to repair.
 


   Vinegar
  
  is better for moistening than
  
   wine
  
  . It is
necessary that the
  
   frame
  
  be quite smooth and even otherwise,
  
   And that the cast be
  
  as you press on one side, the other one
lifts.
 

  This is why the
  
   press
  
  is better, for it tightens evenly, &
more than your
  

    hands
   

  , and makes

the
  
   coarse sand
  
  , which is humid, communicate its humidity to the
  
   soft & fine sand
  
  , which is sprinkled & pounced dry
on the medal.
 

  When you mold, always leave your medal in
  
   the one
  

   some
  



   frames
  
  ,
  
   Is
  

   without stirring
it
  
  because, if your hollow form is not molded very neatly, you can put
it back in the right place by means of
  
   pegs
  
  , which will prevent
it from shifting. But, at first, pounce your medal with very
fine
  

    willow
   
   charcoal
  
  , &
  

    se
   

  next
clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release afterward.
 

  Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the
  
   frame
  
  & the
  
   sand
  
  .
