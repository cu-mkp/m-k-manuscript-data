Molds of things that do not release

Animals that do not release can only be molded in two
molds, which should not be opened until after they are well
reheated &amp; the enclosed animal is well burned. Animals that have
bones or scales, which do not reduce into powder but rather remain as
calcined lumps, will never leave through the gate, whatever blowing
one does or whatever quicksilver one puts there, or a
feather quill during molding to use as a gate. This is why one
molds in two halves, in order that, the mold being opened after
having been reheated, the burned thing can be cleaned out well. But take
heed to let it cool well, in order that, when removing the
clamps, being hot, and when it is most frangible, something
does not break. The crust &amp; ashes that it leaves &amp;
which adhere to the mold while it is hot are removed better
once cold. Note also that on the bottom side of the mold, when
you reheat, the animal which boils leaves some filth. And, on
this occasion, one always marks the mold where the back of the
animal is, in order that, when reheating, it is above &amp; on top &amp;
that through this means it is neater.
