They mix beaten glair of egg with earth with which they make

the first layer of the cope of pieces, &amp; bells, &amp; all

other pieces, saying that the said glair makes it come out

d neatly, &amp; lays down &amp; settles the

substance. En noyau for a small work, glair is also

good.

Rosette, to come out neatly, wants the mold

to be a little hot, &amp; lead which has also been mixed with the

rosette, especially for small pieces.
