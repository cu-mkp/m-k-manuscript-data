Marks from the points of iron wire which are found
on the head of the animal

L With the points, one has previously
set the stance, especially that of the head. But the head being pierced,
there remains around the hole some moisture and a little exudation,
which hinders the sand from covering the point & there
always remains some little opening g. But to avoid
this, you can plant in the slab of the an
iron point, arro cleaned &
rounded at the top end & on this end place there a little hard
wax or du a little mastic or
cement, and by means of this hot iron
wire, hold in place the throat of the animal, which can be removed
when you come to uncover the belly & the throat to make the second
cast.
