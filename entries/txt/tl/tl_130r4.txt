Molding a single vine leaf

Plant it with the points of fine <-iron-> latten
wire & place diagonally on the clay slab,
then cast the first mold. When it has set, uncover the
<-back-> reverse & make the second cast, which once set, you
can take away the leaf. And you will need to reheat your mold
only once, because there will be nothing to burn.
