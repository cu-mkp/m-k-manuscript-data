For giving the color of all kinds of metals to wood

&amp; other things

Take touchstone &amp; pumice stone as much of one as

of the other &amp; grind them together &amp; mix with a hide glue 

stronger than that used for painting, &amp; paint it on

whatever you like. Once dry, rub this layer with any metal

whatsoever, then burnish it.
