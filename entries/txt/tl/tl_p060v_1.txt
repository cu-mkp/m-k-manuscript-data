  Varnish
 
 dry in an
 

   hour
  


  Take
  
   white
   
    turpentine
   
   oil
  

   &
  

   turpentine
  
  &
  
   mastic, pulverized & passed delicately
through a
   
    sieve
   

  , & boil together, stirring
continuously with a
  
   stick
  
  until it is dry. And put in two
  
   liards'
  
  worth of good
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  . And if you extract
the tear of
  
   mastic
  
  , it will be whiter & clearer. There is no
need to put in
  
   turpentine
  
  , but only its
  
   white turpentine
oil
  
  &
  
   mastic pulverized
  
  at your discretion, until it has
enough body.

  Which one knows when, being placed on a
  
   knife
  

   in the
wind
  
  , it does not run. This one is excellent for panels and is dry
within an
  

    hour
   

  and does not stick like the
  
   turpentine
  
  one.
