Couleur for gold or mixture

Verdigris &amp; sal ammoniac, as much of one as the

other, &amp; as much as a bean of

saltpeter. For if you put a quantity in it, it would make it all boil

so much that it would boil over. Saltpeter is only put in to make

it boil, in order that one recognizes when the substance has boiled

enough. This couleur, put on brittle melted gold,

renders it soft immediately.
