& fill them with stuffing cloth &, or
else dry them in an oven #. Then arrange
them on the trees, & have someone who sings, & you will
gather them & catch many.



in an oven that is scarcely hot In
winter. ilAnd in summer
this is done because, before they
    

    
would be dried, the fly would
get into their eyes and make worms. In
winter they are prepared better & dry by themselves
