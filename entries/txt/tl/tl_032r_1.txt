The body of the cuirass

The high plates of the pauldron of the brassard  are like a
masterpiece of the masters, for it is necessary that
these pieces be very precisely hollowed &amp;
adjusted in order that the movement may be free. Cuirass bodies
must be very evenly beaten &amp; driven with the hammer.

Morions from Milan are all in one piece &amp; thus better
than those that are of two.
