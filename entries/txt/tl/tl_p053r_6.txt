Casting of lead and copper

Lead & tin come out well in white chalk but
the softer it is the better. The one from Champaigne fetches
the price that is set in Lyon. Burnt & calcined
horse bones mold very neatly.



I believe that the
marrow from the horns
of oxen or
sheep, that is to say, the spongy bone from the inside,
molds very neatly and is better than bone.



Note that any brittle metal comes out better than the fatty. Also,
lean sand receives & drinks it better than the
dense one.
