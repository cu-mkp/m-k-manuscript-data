Putting to death the animal for molding

You need to be careful not to wound it in taking it. And, having put

it in a glass bottle d with

bran, or in a barrel full half full of

fresh &amp; damp earth, if you want to store them or keep them a

long time, give them live frogs &amp; not dead ones

to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &amp;

grow thin &amp; have long wrinklaulxed skins. Thus the best would be to

mold it as soon as after possible

apre after it has been taken. But before, put it to

death in this way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so

that it would collect no dust. And put inside such a quantity of good

vinegar &amp; urine that it can be covered. And shake it

&amp; torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in an hour or a half. But if you are in a

hurry

To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take

it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,

&amp; when piercing it, it would draw back &amp; spoil the mold.

Water snakes hardly bite.

to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau-de-vie or else mix a little with the vinegar. And soon it will

be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for

whom one would need a lot of eau-de-vie, one uses

vinegar and er urine. But for small

ones, only eau-de-vie, which is done sooner.

When your animal is dead, take it out &amp; clean it carefully of its

old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like

lizards have, and then arrange it thus.

Now, put enough in a glass, &amp; soak &amp; continually keep in it

the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not

big.

Take heed, before it dies, to keep the eyes open es

by blocking the eyelids with a little bit of wax or something

else.
