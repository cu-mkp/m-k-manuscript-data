Windows that the sun will not pass

Take the aforesaid calcined saltpeter &amp; expose it to

a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a

liquor which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the

sun will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One

needs to put the saltpeter on some clean thing

place &amp; it put glowing charcoals on it,

and continue all over until it no longer burns.

It also serves for melting &amp; for adding to alkali salt

for cleaning hands.
