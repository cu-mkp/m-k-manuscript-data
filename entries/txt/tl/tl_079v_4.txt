Mixture for printers

Make a layer of pulverized antimony, &amp; a layer

of latten &amp; old scrapings or thin plates of iron or

clo iron nail heads, and continue in this way

until the crucible is full. And melt inside a four Ã 

vent, &amp; then mix a little tin &amp; fill up the

crucible with lead until it causes it. And

increase the fire &amp; mix to make the substances alloy well. The

mixture for large letters is harder.
