Sal ammoniac and alabaster

 Sal ammoniac, well pulverized <-mou-> &
ground dry on marble, molds very neatly & is of a very beautiful release, & once mixed with alabaster, pulverized
similarly, ii ℥ per lb of
alabaster makes it release well. It suffices to moisten it in
a cave or in the serain or, to
be done more quickly, in a piece of paper between a wet
napkin. Take heed that it does not stay for too long, for it
would become so wet that it would not be good for molding
in a frame, but rather en noyau, in which you will be
able to use it well as long as it dries well at ease & far from the
fire. Otherwise the heat makes it swell & pushes the salt onto
the surface, which renders it lumpy. You can <-in-> anoint the
medal with spike lavender oil, molding 
en noyau. It is better to put in 4 ℥ of
sal ammoniac per lb, and moisten it in a humid
place for two or three days, & so that
when you take fistfuls, it holds together, without, however,
attaching itself & being pasted to your hand. You
will mold very neatly with it. But let it dry & reheat very thoroughly,
leaving the mold inside so that it acquires strength by
reheating, for it becomes hard as stone &, in this way, is
more certain to release well. Otherwise if you release before having
reheated it, there would be danger of it crumbling in some

place because of its delicateness & fineness, even if the medal has a high
relief. Once you have molded with it, pulverize it as before and put it
back in the humidity.



All sand that releases well has body & gives a good hold. Ammoniac
is fatty and <-a va-> is nevertheless sandy,
which makes it release well. There is no better bond than salts
appropriate for metals, for once mixed in powder, they get moistened
together & dry & reheat together.
