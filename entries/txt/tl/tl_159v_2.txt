Carnation

It is molded like the rose, marigold &amp; all
other flowers thus, as is said, namely, whole-mold flowers, &amp; all
the leaves, if you want, in two halves, joining them by solder
for the most secure way, even if you could mold them together in a closed
mold. I cast one that came out very well. But one needs very thin sand &amp; to blow strongly.
