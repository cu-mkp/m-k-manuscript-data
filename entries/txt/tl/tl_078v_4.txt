For making bronze

Take pin filings &amp; other of latten, &amp; put
it together, &amp; grind it on marble, grind it well
with water little by little, until they are distilled, then put them
into some new vessel. And








when you want to use some of it, mix it with very clear glue,
&amp; then you will layer it on what you want two or three times, &amp;
then let it dry. But before layering it, lay down on it one layer of
very clear glue, &amp; let it dry, &amp; rub the said
bronze with a tooth of a wolf or
dog.
