For making varnish

Take one pound of linseed oil, and then you
will put it in a earthen pot, mixed with a crust of
bread and three onions, and put it on top of a
charcoal fire, and you will cook it on a little fire, so that it
boils for the space of five hours. You will take
half an ounce of flour glue, & you will
make it boil just as before and stir with a spoon. And then,
after, you will put in two ounces of well-pestled
sandarac & will do as above. And then after, you will take
mastic & arab<-e->ic,
two ounces each, which will both be well ground, and you
will put everything together, & will make it boil while stirring
continuously, for the space of five hours. And then
you will put <-d’araucq-> rock alum,
two ounces, & then you will make it boil. And if you add
two ounces of
<-l’arable-> arabic to it, if you see
that they are not cooked enough, have it cook more on a low










fire until it is cooked enough. And pour it into a cloth
that should be rather tight. And when you have poured it, let it to
cool a little. And if you see that it is too thick so that you cannot
pour it, you will put a little of the said oil & you will
make it better.
