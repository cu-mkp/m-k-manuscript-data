 For
 

   diamond
  
  points
 
 for engraving
 
  These are for tracing what you want to draw on
  
   stones
  
  &
engraving, & when these
  
   points
  
  are fatty & cannot bite,
one needs to rub them
  
   diamond
  
  against
  
   diamond
  
  . One rubs
them with
  
   diamond
  


    pumice stone powder
   

  . One
needs also to unpolish on a
  

    lead
   
   wheel
  
  either the
  
   stone
  
  or the
  
   glass
  
  on which you want to engrave, for the
polish, which is like
  
   varnish
  
  on
  
   glass
  
  , prevents the
  
   diamond
  
  or
  
   sapphire
  
  from biting well.
  
   But
  
  This
is why it does not bite easily on the
  

    nail
   

  , which is
polished & fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites
easily.
