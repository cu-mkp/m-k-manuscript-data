 Cleaning files
 
  Sometimes they are fattened, & by means of the
  
   grease
  
  , the
  
   lead
  
  , which is fatty in itself, or other
  
   filings
  
  , attach
to it. And you will be able to clean them either with
  

    hot
charcoal
   

  or a
  
   scratch brush made of
   
    wires of
latten.
