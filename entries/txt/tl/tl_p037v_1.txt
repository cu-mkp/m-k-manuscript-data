For sowing melons well, it needs to be at the end of a
moon cycle, for otherwise they would bud too many leaves &
not bear enough fruit. Make small e holes, two
fingers by two fingers, with a stake
& put in each two or three seeds. Next, take very fine
earth & fill the holes lightly with it. Next, spread over
all the thickness of a thumb of havets, that
is to say wheat fl chaff, in order that the
coming rain does not beat the earth & prevent their birth.
Havets attract field mice who eat the seeds. And
for avoiding this, one must moisten them with a s
decoction of wormwood.
