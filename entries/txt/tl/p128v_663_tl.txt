Whitening of cast silver



Because one commonly casts in base silver, & especially the
Germans, and that such an alloy readily makes chappe
or crust, which is contrary toour some
goldsmithsfrom France are usually quick
to whiten their works, especially rough ones, because they only
use common bullitoyre, which is tartar &
common salt, nearly as much of one as the other. But I
have seen an excellent German working thus. Having, in my
presence, cast a little lizard with an alloy of
teston, he made a greyish noi crust.
And to clean it from it, he boiled it in the above mentioned
bullitoyre of tartar & pulverizedcommon saltand mixed with common water, in the
fire of his forge. Once taken out, he brushed it. And
because it was not as clean of this crust as he fancied, he burned some
tartarin some paper until it was
black & no longer smoked. Then, he wet the aforesaid tartard with the water of bullitoyre ,
composed of salt & tartar, & covered all his
lizard with it. Then he put it between the live of
charcoals of his forge & blew a little. When the
lizard was red, he took it out, let it cool, then reheated it
in the bullitoyre. Next, he brushed it in
clear water.

Note that the bullitoyre for silver is never good
in a crucible because the water, taking the form of the
ftartar, evaporates. But the vessel
for boiling, being of copper, is excellent for the whitening of
silver & for the mixture which colors gold.



He heeded to not let his water of tartar boil so much that it
poured out on top, because then its strength goes away. Therefore, when
this first fury of boiling comes, remove it from the fire & put it
back. He held as a secret this burned tartar put on top for
base silver.
