Animal after release

If, by chance, you gave your snake such a curled shape
that the place of the belly cannot easily come out, especially
since the head & the tail, which are the two ends, are
thinner, cut everything which is outside, & reheat the
mold so well that what remained inside burns, then pass some
quicksilver inside, & attracting <-that which->
the ashes & the burnt bones from the inside, it will
also come out, because the conduit is big, & thus will not sour at
all your material. You can pull really strongly the molded
snake, because it is soft & malleable & obedient, &
the mold, having set, is so firm that, because of this, the
imprint will not be spoiled.
