  Molders
 
 from
 
  Foix
 

  Those who mold crosswise
  

  make their
  
   sand
  
  with
  

    crocum
   

  &
  
   calcined slate
  
  , but
  
   slate
  
  always retains its asperity & becomes porous, because it is fatty.
  
   En noyau
  
  , it is not good; in
  
   sand
  
  , it can be accommodated.
They
  
   sieve
  
  their
  
   sand
  
  , grind it on
  

    porphyry
   

  ,
and wet it in
  
   water
  
  , & they take away the finest, which is on
top, then reheat it.
