Molds of plaster for wax

When your mold of plaster is done & dried, take
heed that your mold be of good release, for sometimes it
happens that the animal, being wounded or thin & withered, makes
wrinkles, where retire its scales are, where the plaster enters. And this not being of good release,
the wax animal would attach itself & would break, & you would never
have it perfect. Take heed also to make your gates for the
wax very wide. Thus, & the gates should not be too thick.
They are made when the animal is

 the molds have been made from both sides & the animal is
outside of it.
