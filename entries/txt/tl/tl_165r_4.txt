Plaster for molding

When it is long to set &amp; dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty

&amp; moist, which is what makes it contract in fire &amp; crack,

causing flashing. That which is drawn from lean soil is the best.

Molds of fatty plaster ought not to be kept for a long

time, for they act like fatty earth, which when drying by itself,

cracks. It is best to reheat them soon after they are made, &amp;

to cast. Good plaster keeps a long time in

molds.

It needs to be well oiled, for it is more difficult to separate

the two halves of the molds than when it is mixed.
