 Colors
 
  If you want to keep them beautiful in
  
   gum
  
  and such that they
do not lose any of their true color, put
  
   white wine
  
  , the
whitest and clearest you can, in a
  
   bottle
  
  with a little
  
   tragacanth gum
  
  . And having
  
   stoppered
  
  the
  
   bottle
  
  , scramble & shake it very strongly together, &
let it rest until the
  
   tragacanth
  
  is dissolved. Also put in a
little fine-grained
  
   white salt
  
  to brighten the whole.
Some mix
  
   clear water
  
  with
  
   white wine
  
  , and with this
mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
beautifully in
  
   illumination
  
  work.
