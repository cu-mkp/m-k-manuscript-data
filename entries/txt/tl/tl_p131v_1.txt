When the cast of tin or lead becomes porous



If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
wax which you can gild afterward with silver or
gold. To prevent this, if you cast thin, the alloy of one
℥ <-d'est-> of lead for
one lb of tin is good. But if you cast with lead
for a thick thing, one needs for one lb of the
latter, two ℥ of tin, for the
lead, being fatty & weighty, carries more. From this alloy, I
cast a large lizard like a natural one. In thick things,
<-if-> which keep their heat a long time, if there is little
tin, it makes it porous. Your mold must not be cold, but
of such a heat that you can handle it without harm, or that you can
keep your finger in the gate without burning yourself.
It is also necessary that your lead or tin be as if red.
Melt first the lead & then the alloy of tin on top.
And as you want to cast, put a piece of rosin & then a
little looking-glass tin. If you put too
much lead into the tin, it does not run very thin. And to know
this, if <-l-> the tin cries loudly,
it is a sign there is not too much lead. If it cries weakly, that
means that there is too much. Take heed



You can solder with the <-l'es-> same substance,
then repair it with the burin, file,
chaple & suchlike.




Tin is a metal that penetrates, that becomes porous &
burns, and is fanciful to use, more than gold and
silver.




Lead wants not only to be red, but also lively & runny &
liquid as water, which is a sign of its perfect heat, & the
mold <-ch-> is so hot that you can bear putting
your finger in it. Do not open until it is
cooled. It is a sign of a good cast, as much for it as for gold
& silver, when it exits by the vents.










not to open your mold too hot, for this sours it, makes it
porous & contracts the tin, & makes the molded thing
break. Also, do not quench your hot mold in water, for
this makes the <-the met-> tin or lead
contract.
