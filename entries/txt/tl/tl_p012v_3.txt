agate of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in
a brick of the exact size of the thing & put it inside. Then
I reddened two glassworkersâ€™
solders, & as they were red, I
presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I
had the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I
wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a diamond
point, and I polished it with small hog bristle brushes
and tripoli. I do not know if it would be better to
reheat it under hot ashes, & if it would be good to encase it
in alabaster, which is very cold, as I encased it in the
brick.
