For bringing a cannon over land



If you have To bring a cannon, one needs a hundred
pioneers or more to flatten the tracks by levelling ditches
&amp; others obstacles, such as trees, stone mounds
&amp; similar things to make gabions on the way. Once one is close to
the place one wants to batter, the gunner goes at
night to reconnoiter the most convenient place to mount the
battery

artillery.


        
It is good if the platform is slightly inclined toward the front because
the piece is more quickly mounted for battery &amp; holds the blast
better &amp; batters more fiercely.



&amp; if he does not see well, one gives a false alarm in order
that those on the inside throw torches. Very often, one batters where it
is strongest because the assailed, disdaining the battery, do not make repairs there.
Commonly, there are not many garrets &amp; other defenses in
that place. And when one has made a breach at the strongest part &amp; the
cannon removed, it will surprise the assailed. One approaches
fortified towns at night, but to poorly
fortified towns, pioneers bring gabions and
carry once these are placed, one puts some boards or planks
behind the gabions to keep the pioneers safe, while behind,
they fill the gabions with some earth by means of their
shovels. And while one does this, one raises some false alarm
on another side. And before, one has 



fired a volley at the defenses.
The gabions The pioneers carry the
boards to make a level ground or a platform of four
fingers or half a foot thick, and
one sets them into the earth. The platform is five or six
cano feet larger than the wheels of the cannon
on each side m if there is only one cannon. But if
there are more, the platforms touch. The distance which is between the
pieces is the width of two gabions. As long as the battery
lasts, the gunners sleep &amp; eat close to a cannon. In
small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach the pieces
but one puts plenty of gabions that are high &amp; goes running to them. In large



places one digs trenches. There are always in trenches or behind
barricades some some companions-in-arms on guard duty to defend
the pieces. One keeps the small powder magazine, of three or four
kegs, separately,






a hundred paces away from the battery &amp; one surrounds
them with barricades or trenches. And there one goes to get
powder in bags or frails. And each piece has
its own frail for loading three or four times. Then, when the
cannon is set on the platform, one puts a board that is proof of an
arquebus between two gabions. Then a gunner loads it with a
ladle, &amp; with the rammer which is at
len the other end of the ladle, two men
ram the powder as much as they can, in nine or ten pushes, until
they find the powder to be hard &amp; well-compacted. Next,
another puts hay or straw and the r others
ram a little. Another puts the ball and the hay-bearer puts in
as much of it as before &amp; one rams a little. Some put
wooden bungs but this runs the risk of making the piece
burst. And where one has to fire many cannon shots, one
would need many bungs, which would cost much to carry. Once the
cannon is loaded, xx or xxv pioneers push it forward with
bars, keeping to one side behind the gabions without taking off the
board until the cannon reaches it. Once the cannon is in front, the
gunner mounts it with the wedges which are at the
back, taking the sight on each side and then in the middle. Then another
who is nearby gives fire. Each gunner cannon needs
3 gunners: the loader, the one who aims, the one who gives
fire. Sometimes, against a camp or into a breach, one shoots cartridges,
made as you have elsewhere, or else one uses a basan full of
flint stones, cart nails &amp; similar.
P A ch cannon must not move
unless it has two harnesses, be they of wood or iron. And
to furnish the wheels, powder box, and other furniture of the cannon,
one needs seven quintals and a half of iron.
Pour les pre The best battery is done at a curtain
wall, some say, for that is, as if at an
bieve angle, for by doing this you shake loose
several stones.



Some put small wheels of the piece and a thick board to the end of the
carriage of the piece in order that it may be drawn more quickly and
without making a noise. Others put leather all around the
the wheels &amp; also put leather soles or shoes on
the horsesâ€™ hooves in order that one does not hear
them.
