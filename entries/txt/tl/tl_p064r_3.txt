Vermilion

One ought not to keep it in water when <-tempered->
ground with oil for it loses its color. It is better
to choose whitish vermilion than dark & blackish. For
vermilion is commonly mixed with a little lake, without
which it would hardly be different from minium. But the pale 
casts more vivacity than the dark. It is not desiccative, &
for this reason one mixes in calcined cristallin.
