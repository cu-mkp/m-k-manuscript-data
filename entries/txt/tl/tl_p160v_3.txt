Catching crayfish

Attach to the tip of a stick some liver or lung of a
cow or sheep, & with a small string
you make a basket hang from the tip of the said
stick. Put in water where crayfish eat,
& they will quickly come to accumulate on the flesh. Extract gently
from the water, & those who want to go back into the
water will fall into the basket.
