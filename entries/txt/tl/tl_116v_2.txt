Mixture of tin and lead

For delicate plants &amp; other flowers or thin foliage, the fine

tin ought to exceed the lead more than three parts.

And if it is a thick &amp; coarse material, the lead ought to

exceed by more than three parts. Heat the mostly tin

mixture until it is almost red &amp; very hot. And when you want to

cast, in removing your crucible from the fire, throw in two or

three grains of rosin, &amp; for one lb &amp; a half

or two of lead or tin, put with the rosin as

much looking-glass tin as the size of a hazelnut

with its shell, &amp; mix &amp; cast. And make sure that there is

more of the metal than is needed, in order that some is left.

However, if there is not enough, finish casting, &amp; it will take. But

it will not be so neat. Next, dip your mold into water,

&amp; with a point, release it carefully so that nothing is

spoiled. Make your cast a bit longer. If the material is very

thin, one needs for it to be almost all tin.

If you mold de plu want to cast in lead or

tin en noyau in the aforesaid sand, reheat your

mold once, only if there is nothing to burn inside. But if it

is for plants, flowers, &amp; animals to be burnt, one needs to reheat it

two times, however not as much the second time for lead &amp;

tin as for silver &amp; gold. For for these, they

ought to be red when you cast, but for lead and tin, let

it cool until you can hold the tip of your

finger in the gate without burning yourself,

but you find a lukewarm heat.
