Gardener

For sowing melons well, it needs to be at the end of a

moon cycle, for otherwise they would bud too many leaves &amp;

not bear enough fruit. Make small e holes, two

fingers by two fingers, with a stake

&amp; put in each two or three seeds. Next, take very fine

earth &amp; fill the holes lightly with it. Next, spread over

all the thickness of a thumb of havets, that

is to say wheat fl chaff, in order that the

coming rain does not beat the earth &amp; prevent their birth.

Havets attract field mice who eat the seeds. And

for avoiding this, one must moisten them with a s

decoction of wormwood.
