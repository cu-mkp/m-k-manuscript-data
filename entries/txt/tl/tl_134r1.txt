For mending a pierced mold



If the molded animal comes away in some place <-to not have-> and
deviates from the stance that you gave it, because it was not quite dead
or because it was not well attached with the iron points
or with melted wax, and it does not have the thickness that it
needs on the outside, at the middle of the swelling, or is pierced,
before removing the animal from inside, uncover what seems to you the
weak part, or the place that is pierced, and make small holes
all around [<-all around->], then soak the back of the
mold. And cast promptly on top of the same tempered sand,
which will enter in these openings & mold & attach to the other.
But, one will need to lute this place well afterward.
