It can be gathered from the words of Herodotus that the
navigation of the Portuguese was not newly invented by them, as
they brag. At the beginning of the first book entitled Clio, he
says that the Phoenicians would come from the Red Sea
by continuous navigation to the coast of Greece, mainly to
Argos, to which they would carry merchandise from
Egypt & from Assyria, which they usually sold out
of within 6 days.
