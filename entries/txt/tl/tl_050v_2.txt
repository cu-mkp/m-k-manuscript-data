Curried steel and files

The steel that farriers &amp; iron

workers commonly use is not refined like that from

Germany or Biscay, which is reduced in hardness

p in the bath of molten iron, but

only in the iron bars which are transported in flat

ingots from the forges of Foix &amp; elsewhere,

there is a harder &amp; whiter &amp; finer kind than the other, as it

comes from the mine. And the workers choose it

&amp; use it like the other steel. And because that it comes from

common iron, they call it strong iron. But it is not as

excellent as purified steel like that from Germany &amp;

Biscaye, which is sold in small beads. Some curry

steel, giving it a heating, then temper it &amp;

water in a large quantity of water, then forge it.

&amp; fine steel, which is brittle, breaks and crumbles, &amp;

iron allows itself to be stretched. Thus they separate the

finest steel, &amp; which with another heating they

reduce to a mass. The Germans make their files from

strong iron.

One applies steel to tools

dess not on both sides, but underneath the part

where one sharpens &amp; whets them. &amp; in this part, they must be of

very soft iron.

Levantines refine our

steel because their country does not provide them with any. And

they reheat it in a pot with bitumen, &amp;c.
