Kitchen pots are made well, in order not to give a bad taste to

the food, with the same metal the bells are made of. It is

true that founablesders mix in

more latten to make them yellower, to make them more vendable.

But the latten by itself, &amp; at a mere touch, is

stinking &amp; of bad odor.

Latten does not lose, or only slightly, its calamine

in an four Ã  vent when it is melted in a crucible, nor

in a wood furnace, but it does in a

bellows furnace because bellows give violent fire.
