Catching nightingales

See the 15th folio after
this

For trapping them, one needs to observe their nature, the food that
they like the best, & the season of their pleasure. The
nightingale, as long as it sings, maintains a territory for
itself alone. Therefore approach, making as if searching the ground for
something. And taking some worms which come from old meal or
from beneath kneading troughs or mills, which it is fond of, put some on your hat attached
with a pin or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five
or six paces from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the
ground & put in some worms and your device of little
crossed sticks. It will be anxious for you to leave so it can go
see what you have done, and seeing worms, it will enter.


Some sell them on trees.

The coolness of the evening
and the morning, near fountains & shaded places, are
more appropriate for taking them.
