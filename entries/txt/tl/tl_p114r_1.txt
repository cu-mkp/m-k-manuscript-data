to cast by the tail or from the back of the animal,
make it so that the vents come from
the head & the middle of the body to join
to the said tail,
where the
gate is done, which is the
end of the
mandore. 




       
<-N-> And having done your cast, do not forget to make in
it some holes and <-[illegible]->notches because the metal will run more neatly thus than if
the cast were even, for it gets corrupted in its notches & holes,
& does not go so much at once, & does not become as porous. This
done, <-put-> join <-t-> the two halves of your mold & strengthen the joints,
putting around these some small clamps of iron wire of this shape

. They
prevent 
the molds from deforming & corrupting while reheating.



    

This is the shape of the clamps
