 Second cast
 
  When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is the
back, the backbone, and the entire top part, and the
  

    len
   

  half-
  
   mold
  
  where it is enclosed has set
and is hard enough,
  


   +
  


  uncover the whole bottom part & side of the belly,
  

  now with a
  
   knife
  

   &
   
    tant
   

  at the thickest places, & then with a
  
   penknife
  
  , where the
most delicate parts are enclosed, such as the legs, the tail, &
similar things, and because the head is higher, you will also need to
look for it & uncover deeper, and make a deeper notch there which
ought to release easily. That is to say, widening on the outside, in order that
the second
  
   mold
  
  that you will cast on it can come out well,
which even the animal can help with, which is malleable and obedient,
being natural. However,
  

    ad
   

  be more careful
when uncovering the throat of the
  
   lizard
  
  than with the
  
   snake
  
  , for the
  
   lizard
  
  has large jaws & large bones
that are not malleable and has hollow ears, where, if the
  
   wet sand
  
  has
entered, it is not
  

    aff
   

  easy to release. But you will
avoid all of this, if you uncover half of the head and those things that
you know do not release well. Once everything is uncovered well, blow
on top & wipe each part, by wiping with
  
   tiny
   

     hog
    
    bristle
   
   brushes
  
  , slightly moistened by the end with a
little
  
   saliva
  
  ,
  
   or with
   
    clear water
   
   , as you uncover
it
  
  , in order that
  
   your
  
  the uncovered lower part of your
animal will be very neat.

  With this done, dip
  
   the
   
    rev
   


   your
   
    mold
   

  , for the
  

    length
of a paternoster
   

  ,
  

  your
  
   mold
  
  in
  
   water
  
  , not
  
   from the
  

   the
  
  uncovered side but
opposite & the reverse of the uncovered thing. And this is in order that,
by sucking the
  
   water
  

   inside
  
  , the
  
   oil
  
  with which
you next anoint the other side
  
   to avoid
  
  , is not
imbibed at all, but remains on the surface & prevents the second
cast that you will cast on it from attaching to it. Having therefore
thus dipped
  
   the reverse of
  
  your
  
   mold
  
  in the
  
   water
  
  , take a
  
   paintbrush
  
  especially dedicated to
this &
  
   anoint it
  
  with it, anoint with
  
   oil
  
  the whole surface of the
  
   mold
  
  , except the animal, which must in
no way touch the
  
   oil
  
  , & take heed to retrace well & to anoint
with the point of a
  
   paintbrush
  
  between the parts &
through all the delicate parts. And if by chance the
  
   oil
  
  is
imbibed, dip the
  

    mo
   

  reverse of the
  
   mold
  
  , as
mentioned, in
  
   water
  
  , & you will see the
  
   oil
  
  return to
the surface in little drops.
 

  Mold small animals like big ones, except that you need to make
  
   delicate points of
   

     fil
    



     of
    



     cist
    



     cittern
    
    strings
   

  , both long & short.
 







  remove with your
  
   small flat pincers
  
  , all the
  
   points
  
  .
 



  And then
  
   +
  

   now with
  






  However, leave the
  
   point
  
  of the throat, so that it serves as a
clue to find the head, which is deeper down than any other part, because
when making the arrangement you disposed it higher. It is also at the
level of the head that you should make the biggest notch, & start
with this one to uncover, and follow the rest through the trace of the
  
   points
  
  .
 




   #
  


  And if some bit of nail from a leg, or from a tail, or from another
should separate from the
  
   mold
  
  , put
  
   there
  
  between the two a small grain of
  
   wax
  
  , & with the
  
   point of a
hot
   
    iron wire
   

  , join it, then adapt your
  
   mold
  
  with a
  
   knife
  
  , & make notches on its sides so that the other
half binds to it. üùã
  







  This thus prepared, place your
  

    de
   

  first
half-
  
   mold
  
  on the
  
   cake
  
  of
  

    earth
   


   clay
  
  , & put the circle also around, & make the mark for
the thickness similar to the first. Then, with another rather thickish
  
   paintbrush
  
  , moisten well everywhere the uncovered half
  
   & the belly
  
  of your animal
  
   And
  

   with
   
    eau-de-vie
   

  ,
without leaving anything, if it is possible, which is not moistened, for
this is the secret which makes it come out neat. And next, as promptly
as will be possible for you, before the
  
   eau-de-vie
  

   not
  
  evaporates, wet your
  
   sand
  
  and cast it in thrusts and by blowing & moving the
  
   mold
  
  as you did
for the first one, making sure that the
  
   first
   
    q
   

  beginning of that which you pour on the animal should be a little lighter than the
next one so that it moistens everywhere & closely follows the more delicate
parts. So, leave it for a
  

    quarter of an hour
   

  to set, then
remove the circle & the
  
   clay
  

   cake
  
  . And, with a
  
   knife
  
  , arrange your two
  
   molds
  
  uniformly together in a
long shape of a
  
   mandore
  
  , as mentioned, because of the cast.
Then, dip a little the whole
  
   mold
  
  evenly, at the level of the
joints, in
  
   water
  
  , for this is another secret to unjoin them,
otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore, by
this means, and next, extract gently & with patience and method
the half of the animal remaining in one of the
  
   molds
  
  ,
  
   for
  
  pulling it sometimes from one side & sometimes from
the other, to avoid breaking any of it, or also spoiling something from
the
  
   mold
  
  .
  
   And
  
  The latter being empty,
  
   extract
  
  rejoin the two halves so that no dust
enters it, & put them aside until you want to reheat them, make the
gate & vents, & place the
  
   clamps
  
  . As for the animal, so
that it does not dry & that you might be able to mold it four of
five times, put it in
  
   water
  
  . And I think that it would keep even
better in
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  . However, the best would be to mold
in the same
  
   day
  
  the 4 or 5
  
   molds
  
  that you can do,
because these corrupt animals in themselves
  
   stink
  
  within one
  

    day
   

  . Having left your
  
   molds
  
  one or two
  

    es
   



    days
   

  to dry, for they stay
humid for a good
  

    month
   

  , make the vents on one
half
  










   +
  


  Note that when you have made your second
  
   cast
  
  , were you to leave your
  
   mold
  
  for one
  

    day
   

  or a
  

    night
   

  without opening
it, you would need to then dip it in
  
   hot water
  
  or else reheat it
before opening it, as for
  
   crabs
  
  .
 

  If, after both halves of the
  
   noyau
  
  have made a strong & hard set, you
would not dip your
  
   mold
  
  in
  
   water
  
  , it would not unjoin at
all. But as you dip the reverse of the
  
   mold
  
  in
  
   water
  
  ,
the imbibed
  
   oil
  
  collects at the top & at the level of the
joints & makes it separate.
 

  However, take heed your second
  
   mold
  
  is of good thickness &
that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having
dipped it in
  
   water
  
  , & you want to open it, there is a risk
that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open
it, dip all of it in
  
   water
  

   and rub it everywhere
  
  ,
where it will harden if it has set well. Then, take your two
  
   molds
  
  , joined with a
  
   rough
   
    linen
   
   cloth
  
  in
order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you
wanted to tear apart a loaf of
  
   bread
  
  . But if it happens to break, join
it & on the reverse, strengthen the joints with
  
   clamps
  
  .
  



  Next, you can repair the faults with small
  
   chisels
  
  .
 



  to cast by the tail or from the back of the animal,
  

  make it so that the vents come from
  

  the head & the middle of the body to join
  

  to the said tail,
  

  where the
  

  gate is done, which is the
  

  end of the
  


   mandore
  
  .
 





    N
   



  And having done your cast, do not forget to make in
it some holes and
  



  notches
  

  because the
  
   metal
  
  will run more neatly thus than if
the cast were even, for it gets corrupted in its notches & holes,
& does not go so much at once, & does not become as porous. This
done,
  
   put
  
  join
  

    t
   



  the two halves of your
  
   mold
  
  & strengthen the joints,
putting around these some small
  
   clamps
  
  of
  
   iron wire
  
  of this shape
  



  . They
prevent
  

  the
  
   molds
  
  from deforming & corrupting while reheating.
 




   This is the shape of the
   
    clamps
