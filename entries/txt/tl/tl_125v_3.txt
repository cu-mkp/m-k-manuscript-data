Plaster for casting of wax

When you want to cast in wax in the plaster mold,

you must know as secret that there is need for your mold to be

in hot water. Never does the animal come out so neatly than in

metal, because the wax sticks. But it is to model an

animal as close to nature, et to repair

it afterward. One needs to smooth well away all the scales, when for

wax would enter there &amp; not release well. In molding thus

the animal, flatten down the scales for wax &amp;, on

the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they stand up for

animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not wait for the

wax to a bit cool completely to release it,

but do so when it is still a bit warm. When you have also molded the

first cast of the animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its

release, there is as much of it in one half of the mold as in the other. Make also strong wide gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified

when it is released, &amp; afterward you cut this off.

Alabaster, commonly called so, which is nevertheless

plaster, is very hard but it shrinks a lot. It is very good to

make medals, but it wants to be very finely sieved.
