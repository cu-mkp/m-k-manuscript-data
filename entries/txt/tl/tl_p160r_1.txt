 for large
 
  molds
 





  The
  
   screw
  
  is riveted to this
  
   stirrup
  
  ,
  

  which is
  
   nailed
  
  onto the upper
  
   plate
  
  , & by this means,
raises it &
  
   presses
  
  it.
 



  They are two
  
   sheets of
   
    iron
   

  attached by four
  
   small
   
    iron
   
   pillars
  
  , in such a way, however, that
  

    lles
   


   the upper
  
  is
  

    nt
   

  able to have play
& run freely the length of the
  
   pillars
  
  , & that the
lower one is fixed. At the end of the
  
   pillars
  
  is affixed an
  
   iron
  

   St. Andrew
  
  's cross,
  

  in the middle of which is a
  
   screw
  
  which tightens the
  
   sheets
  
  against the
  
   molds
  
  which are between the two.
 

  Or, for small
  
   molds
  
  ,
one makes a
  
   frame
  
  , & having put the
  
   molds
  
  between
two
  
   plates of
   
    iron
   

  , one
  
   sets
  
  tightens them in
the
  
   frame
  
  with
  
   wedges
  
  .
 

  The
  
   large
   
    wooden
   
   presses made with screws
  
  , besides being heavy to put near to the
  
   forge
  
  for casting, one cannot know when they tighten too much,
& very often, they break the
  
   mold
  
  .
