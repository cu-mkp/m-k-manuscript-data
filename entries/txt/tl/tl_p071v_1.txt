Varnish

To a half lb of spike lavender oil, put in
4 â„¥ of sandarac & mastic subtly pulverized. 
And first, boil your oil in a
pot on a chafing dish, and then mix in little by
little the aforesaid gums, stirring continually with a
small stick split and quartered at the tip, & when you do
not collect gum with the tip, that is to say that it is totally
melted & that your varnish is done. And to render it clearer,
put in a small lump of camphor to decoct. It is true that
with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the spike
lavender oil be good, clear & not fatty, otherwise
your varnish would be worth nothing. You can test it,
d soaking some paper in it & heating
it. If the oil, which will evaporate, leaves the paper
clean, without being a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is
fatty.
