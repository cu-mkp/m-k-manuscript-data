 Reheating the
 

   noyau
  
  molds
 

  After your
  
   molds
  
  have their gate, vents &
  
   clamps
  
  , as is said, make at the end of the
  
   forge
  

   in
  
  , or in some clean place, a surrounding of
  
   bricks
  
  , and fill it with large half-lit charcoals. And place your
  
   molds
  
  on top, and leave the charcoals thus to kindle by
themselves for a
  

    half hour
   

  , so that they heat little
by little and not all at once. Finally, as they will begin to become white,
beat
  
   little by little
  
  the thus half-lit large charcoals
on top & blow with your
  
   little bellows
  
  until they are
warmed. And thus, little
  
   by little
  
  , invigorate the fire,
without haste, until your
  
   molds
  
  are quite red on the outside
& the inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which
does not release well, & if, for this reason, one needs to burn
  
   it
  
  in the
  
   mold
  
  , & when you look through the gate, & through it, you see the
  
   molds
  
  are very red & inflamed
inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if
you do not see this signal, increase & continue the fire until it is
the case. If there is nothing in the
  
   mold
  
  that needs burning,
it will be enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is
for casting
  
   tin
  
  . They reheat better in a
  
   reverberatory
furnace
  
  .
 


  Do not pull out
  

  your
  
   reheated molds
  


  from the fire before they
  

  have cooled
  

  themselves, & take care
  

  that the
  
   wind or the
cold
  
  does not hit them while very hot, for this would make them burst.
  

  One must not reheat them before they
  

  are dry and firmed up, for they would
  

  cast in a different way, and
  

  it is necessary beforehand to make
  

  gates & vents
  

  & place
  
   clamps
  
  .
 





  Take care not to heat the fire in one go, for fear
  

    f
   

  that your
  
   molds
  
  crack inside.
 

  They are reheated enough when the entire hole of the gate is red. When
it is black, it is not enough.
 

  For casting in
  
   silver
  
  , one must not reheat two times
  
   &
  
  , if there is nothing in the
  
   mold
  
  that needs
  
   releasing
  
  burning, simply because it does not
release well. All the
  
   molds
  
  of flowers are reheated
two times, first for
  











  burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts which are left inside. Next, one
needs to clean them & remove the
  
   ashes
  
  . Second, reheat them
& render them red for casting. At the beginning, reheat with some
charcoals, gently lit, and put your
  

    noyau
   
   molds
  
  flat
on the charcoals surrounded by
  
   bricks
  
  .
  
   Frame molds
  
  are
reheated on a
  
   grate
  
  .
