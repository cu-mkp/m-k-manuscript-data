Casting of lead and tin in plaster

If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very

weighty and that does not need to burn in the mold, you can

cast in plaster &amp; brick, mixed like above, and not in

plaster alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if

it is not accompanied. But, with brick, it holds well.

However, take heed to dry out your mold at length &amp; on a

slow fire &amp; with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But

when your work is of flowers or other things that want to

be their molds reheated &amp; set ablaze, mix in some

feather alum &amp; even some crocum. I have

molded in plaster &amp; brick very neatly, &amp; it

withstood several castings.

I tried plaster &amp;

brick alone and molded en noyau like others. My

mold was very neat, having lightly oiled &amp; rubbed

with eau-de-vie my medal. I made my gate ample at the entrance,

becoming narrower up to the medal, which was very thin. I notched the gate

which embraced well the medal. I dried the mold well on a slow

fire &amp;, at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let it

cool in such a way that I could hold my finger

to it without burning myself. I made an alloy of 4

℥ of tin &amp; six

deniers of lead. I cast red, and it came out

well. Next, I put in for 4 ℥ of

tin, xii deniers of lead; it came out

very well.

When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat

it for lead &amp; tin. But for flowers &amp; what should

burn, yes.
