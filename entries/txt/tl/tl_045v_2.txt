For adjusting a crooked cannon

Take off the breech and place it on an smooth &amp; well-leveled

table and pass through the inside a very smooth string without

knots, on each end of which there should be a plumb

hanging from each side. Then look into the barrel along the

string, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the

place where it does not touch &amp; hit with a hammer on the outside on

that side &amp; in the same place, &amp; thus it will be righted, &amp;

do thus all the way round.
