Wheat oil

One needs to make it between two quite sparkling hot iron

plates, especially the lower one, which will be sloping, on

which you will put some wheat, quite even &amp; uniform.

And then you will place the other, all red, on top, &amp; you will press

it until you see the black oil drip well. Reiterate that until

you have enough of it. This oil dries immediately. It gives gold

color to silvered &amp; burnished things, augments the color of

gilded things, serves as a varnish on iron for

engraving on it afterward, for varnishing sword guards tawny. And could

also serve makers of gilded leather well.

One needs to use it when it is newly

made. And for things to be molded, it must not be as thick as for

coloring.

It is not for anointing hairy animals,

for it is too strong &amp; stiff, but it is good to give form to the

legs of a small animal, like a fly &amp; suchlike. It is also

excellent for coloring false white stones.
