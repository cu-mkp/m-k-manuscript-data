Painting on crystal or glass

They paint in oil without lines, except for the faces where
they trace the nose & the mouth with black in small work, then they
make strokes & highlights in white, next they coat all with
flesh color. And as for the ground, they make it with azur d’Acre 
for more beauty, or with lake for a quickly-done red, 
or with dragon’s blood for the most beauty. But
one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even & of
one color, & thus for other colors. Next, they put underneath it a
foil backing for topaz, or one of gold or
silver.
