  Nightingale
 

  It needs to have a cage made like a
  
   barn
  
  ,
            like those for
  
   calendras
  
  , doubled with
  
   green cloth
  
  ,
            because it fears the
  
   cold
  
  . And for making it accustomed to
            eating when first it is put in the
  
   cage
  
  , one needs to give it
  

    ants
   
   with soil
  
  at the bottom of the
  
   cage
  
  , to
            make it accustomed to pecking
  
   then it
  
  , and give it
  
   chopped
   
    sheep
   
   â€™s heart
  
  & immediately some
  
   eggs
  
  &
  

    mealworms
   

  .
