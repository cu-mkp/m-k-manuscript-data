bit, <-qua-> so that <-t-> you can
take it out if you need to. And take heed that it is necessary that
these points be of the most delicate iron wire possible
which can support the size of the animal. For the more delicate it is, the
smaller the hole that it leaves appears. However, one needs 
different thicknesses of these, because <-il->
<-de-> the points which are put in the body
& in thicker places, like under the throat, ought to be longer &
stronger than the ones of the legs & thin parts, where the
needles ought to be subtle & delicate, almost like the
thickest strings of spinets. And it is better that they
be of iron wire, which is firmer than the one of latten.
And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg, ought to be
joined to the body, do not put the point there, not to corrupt
it. But place wax, as much as a grain of
millet, between the body & <-ce->
<-which-> the end of the tail, then with a bit of
flattened & hot iron wire, touch this wax & join
by lightly pressing. Thus having placed your animal on the
cake shaped like a mandore, place all around a
circle of the same

 b & join everything well together in a circle, then, with a
big knife, with which you have cut your cake to
the right size, trim the outside which exceeds it, & place there a
piece to close it as you see in b. Then, with a small curved
instrument, mark on the inside of the circle the thickness you want
to give to the mold, which will be for a common snake
as thick as two thumbs, in order that when you
cast in your wetted sand, you will see when it is thick enough. All of
this carefully arranged, moisten well everywhere with good eau-de-vie, with a paintbrush, the body of the animal
which is uncovered. For there is the secret, <-of the most->
kept well hidden, because everything that will be <-v->
touched by eau-de-vie will undoubtedly come out very
neatly & without <-porosity-> any small eyes or holes
that one calls porosity, which usually come not at the back & in the
thick sides of the mold, but on the edges. And as soon as you
have thus moistened everything with eau-de-vie, cast
in your wetted sand without letting the eau-de-vie dry,
which evaporates promptly. And wet it thus.






and make sure that the point is longish, depending on how much you want to elevate the head, and that it be pointed on both ends. Once placed
thus, plant your snake on the slab of earth, &
arrange the head first and then the rest.







If, after you have placed your animal on your clay
cake, you are distracted with other occupations, rub your
animal with eau-de-vie, & under the belly, so that it
does not dry & attach itself to the earth.








If, when you pierce your animal, it renders water from the bottom
of the side of the belly on the slab of earth, clean it well
with cotton for the sand that

would touch it would be lumpy. If
it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and touch it
& moisten well with eau-de-vie.









<-Molding-> Making the arrangement and disposition
of the animal

Having made provision of fatty earth called
clay, that should be grey because that commonly is the best, or
another which has good binding & which should be well prepared &
beaten, such that it is handleable without attaching to the
hands nor the work, make a lasagna or like a

cake of this earth equally flattened with a round

stick which pastry makers use, which should be a little
thicker than a thumb. And on this
cake, arrange your animal, <-aya->
imitating in that its nature & <-fa-> the fashion in
which it commonly turns itself. And first, with a good needle,
pierce it from underneath in the middle of the throat & up to
<-u[illegible]-> the top bone of the head. Retract the
needle, & in its place & its hole, put the point of
an iron wire of such a length that it suffices to hold the
head of the animal as <-q-> high as it must be, & if
the skin moves into the inside <-&-> when you put in the
point
, pull it out with <-a->
<-point-> the edge of your small pincers, &
arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point in the
cake of clay. Thus, the head will be held high,
which will have better grace, & being secured, next, arrange the gesture
of the body & the feet & the entanglement as you think will
look best. And so that it is secure & does not move at all when you
cast in the sand, <-put-> secure the legs
<-& the corp-> with little points of iron
wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp
needle. Do the same on the body parts that you will deem necessary,
<-arranging-> making sure that the points
passing through the animal are fixed in the cake of earth
and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal
by a





Take a fine needle of steel, & which is the sharpest
possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the points
of iron, it passes without forcing anything, & by its
roughness does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a thickish
point of iron in thick places & thin ones in thin
places. But heed as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
point passed through the animal in the slab of earth,
<-for-> but having planted it, take it out of the
earth & not out of the animal, & <-do ains-> 
next, fix it. This is done because, by fixing it the
first time, it pushes in the skin of the snake, and by taking
the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.




When you put again the points you have already used, clean them
well of rust so that they do not take away some skin.



The principal disposition of your arrangement is to <-di-> place
the head raised & looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head
on a solid plank or table <-& [illegible]->, making the
point pass through the bottom of the throat,
<-s'arrestan-> entering into the top of the head,
