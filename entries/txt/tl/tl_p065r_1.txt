 Shadows
 
  Because blacks make different colors, some a reddish black, others
tending toward blue, and others toward green, choose those which tend
toward yellow to make beautiful shadows in
  
   oil
  
  , for the shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground
  
   jet
  
  , which you will mix with a little
  

    yellow
   
   ocher
  
  &
  
   lead white
  
  . Or else, after
you have ground your
  
   lead white
  


    bro
   

  and
  
   clean
   
    p
   

  gathered it with the
  

  ,
  

  grind the
  
   jet
  
  into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men’s shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women’s shadows. Take, then, some
black of
  

  , a little
  
   sap green
  
  &
  
   bistre
  
  , &
you will have a perfect shadow for women in
  
   distemper
  
  .
 

  The powder of
  


     orberé
    
    grain
   

  is darker than
  
   umber
  
  & when you lack
  
   umber
  
  , the said powder will do,
but it does not have body.
