Sand of crocum

One can use the mixture of crocum ferri in

molds for silver as well as for gold, for it

firms them &amp; keeps them from cracking &amp; making flashing. And I

believe that for flat things it would withstand bien

de several casts, which, however, for gold &amp;

silver is hardly practiced.

Try, for lead &amp; tin, crocum.
