  Snails
 

  Those which are found in the
  
   sea
  
  & similarly those in
which certain
  
   small crabs
  
  dwell are very beautiful for
  
   grottos
  
  , if they are stripped of the first crust of their
shell with
  
   aquafortis
  
  , for they truly appear to be made of
  
   mother of pearl
  
  .
