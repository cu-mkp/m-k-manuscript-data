Infusion of anthos or

rosemary

In the month of August, the flower is better

cooked &amp; more suitable for making oil. Take of it whatever

quantity you like, and put it into a bottle

well stoppered afterward, &amp; leave to wilt in there

in the shade for a day. Then put in it

the first substance of wine, &amp;

leave it to rest three or four days, and next express the

whole into e another vessel, &amp; into this very same

substance of wine, put in

seven or eight infusions of new flowers. Next, leave the last

infusion in the sun for a month.

Next, distil it through an alembic, Ap and take ii

â„¥ of this water in two or three

spoonfuls of white wine, but this is for the

elderly. Paul III used it.
