Pewterers

They put into one quintal of fine tin one
lb of looking-glass tin, which renders the tin
thicker. There are two kinds of tin, one of them nearly like
lead, which runs better, the other brittle, which becomes
thicker. They cast in solid & thick tin molds or, to
do it more neatly, in copper molds engraved with a
burin, or in stone, or in earth. Since
latten scraps, mixed in, only render the tin more
breakable & harder & difficult to work with, they cast
in their very hot molds <-& almost roug-> &
with very hot tin. They fumigate their tin molds with
resin candles.

Brittle <-dou-> tin is found mixed into
saulmons, easy to cut, but difficult to put to use & melt
if it is not mixed with the other soft one. And without this,
it would become waste.
