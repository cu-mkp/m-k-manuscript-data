 For casting in
 
  sulfur
 

  To cast neatly in
  
   sulfur
  
  , arrange the
  
   bread pith
  
  under the
  
   brazier
  
  , as you know. Mold in it what you want & let dry,
& you will have very neat work.
 

  Try
  
   sulfur
  
  passed through
  
   melted wax
  
  , because it no longer
inflames & no longer makes eyelets.
