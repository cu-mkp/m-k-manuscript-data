   Tin
  
  retracts when it is thick, thus it is best to cast it thin &
to make two pieces out of one, then
  
   solder
  

   them
  
  if
need be. One uses a strong piece of
  
   taffeta
  
  to sieve the
  
   fine
sand
  
  with which one first covers the medal to the
  
   thickness of a
   
    teston
