 As I saw that they did not smoke anymore & that, scratching
the back & the front of the cast & having found that they are
rough & firm & hard on one side and the other, which is a good
sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some fine
tin <-f->, one lb, & one ounce
of lead, fine & new. I melted it in a crucible until
it was, <-a little-> as it were, a little red. Being in this way quite hot
<-I smoked & not p-> & being ready to cast, & not
before, I smoked with the smoke of a tallow candle all
sides of my frames & imprint & cast & everything.
I set my frame, well joined, in the press. I drew my
crucible from the fire. I left it a little so that
the redness at the bottom of the crucible could <-pass-> die
down. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three
grains of something like pitch rosin, & at the same time the
size of a bean of looking-glass tin, & I
mixed, & stirred the crucible a little, and I cast. And the
medal came out as neat as the principal. I smoked it with the
candle & cleaned it with small
brushes.



Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
lower, will come out better & make the cast longish. And when you
cast several medals in a large frame, they will come out
better.
