Damasked cloth

You can damask a cloth with two different colors and imitate
embroidery without adding anything to it, in this way. Once it is
dyed yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you.
Then you will baste some string or a thicker cord onto the
pouncing and thrust it into a dye of guesde woad
or pastel woad & it will become green, except that
which is beneathus the string, which will remain yellow because the
green dye will not have penetrated there. And you can do thus
with other colors, and instead of cord or string, add some
pieces of paltry cloth, cut into moresque shapes, on top of the
first colors. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.
