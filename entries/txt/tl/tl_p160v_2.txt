 Delicate work of
 
  gold
 
 and of
 
  silver
 

  One can make
  
   flies
  
  from it by hand without casting, &
the wings & feet can be joined by
  
   solder
  
  , which cannot be done with delicate works of
  
   lead
  
  &
  
   tin
  
  because
they would melt. And the work of
  
   gold
  
  can be
  
   enameled
  
  .
