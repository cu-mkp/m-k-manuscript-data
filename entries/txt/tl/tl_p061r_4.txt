 Lights
 
  Your
  
   paintbrush
  
  shows it to you by casting a shadow
which must always follow the
  
   back of your hand
  
  , not in a
straight line like this
  

  ,
for the light would be too crude & too harsh, but obliquely & as
if at an incline, thus
  

  .
It is necessary that the panel not be facing the
  
   light
  
  head-on, but half turned
against it. And above all look for soft light, for it makes soft both
the shadow & the work, as a harsh light a harsh
work.
