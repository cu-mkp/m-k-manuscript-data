Wood color

One gives a layer of bistre, then a coat of

varnish.

and even it well, then and once quite dry, they draw their

portrait &amp; layer their natural flesh color, leaving the space for

shadow, like the side of the forehead &amp; the cheek, &amp; the area

around the eyes blank &amp; dry until they have filled in the rest. Next

they put their shadows separately, which they do not make so dark, but rather

that which the natural can make. In sum, they do not put shadow on flesh

color nor flesh color on shadow, but white on white &amp; black on black,

Thus &amp; each on their own. In this way their work is neat

&amp; the colors do not die.
