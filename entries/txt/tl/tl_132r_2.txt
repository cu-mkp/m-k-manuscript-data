Method for reheating the molds

Light charcoals in the forge, &amp; then arrange

them in rows in a corner of it, according to the size of your

mold, in such a way that it can be furnished with three or 4

fingers all around, and especially at the bottom of

the mold, which is the thickest and which. Your

charcoals thus arranged, place your molds on top of

them, &amp; not on a grate, as some do, because they

would take the fire too harshly. And leave for some time thus, &amp;

little &amp; by little, warm your oven, always adding some lit

charcoal. And as long as the mold is damp, the

charcoals will be as if died down from below. But as it dries,

they will kindle by themselves. And when it is dry on one side, turn it to

the other. And when it is dry on both, &amp; it will no longer smoke. At

that moment, invigorate the fire &amp; cover it with lit

charcoals. And as it will begin to redden, do not blow the

charcoals with the little bellows, for this would make it

blow burst. And similarly, when it is red, keep it well

covered with lit charcoals &amp; do not uncover it, for it would

crack. Make sure wind from a window does not beat upon it. Let

cool

When you want to reheat your molds, &amp; be they

luted or not, mark on the belly the place to put at the bottom,

against the lit charcoals, que because if the

ardor of the fire were to make them crack, it would be better that this be

at the belly &amp; from underneath than on the back.

If your mold is small, one ought not to leave it

rest so much in the fire, for it corrupts and cracks there,

for it reheats more quickly than a big one.

by itself. When it begins to redden, it is soon red everywhere.

But make sure, through the gate, that it is red at the bottom &amp; that

nothing appears black.
