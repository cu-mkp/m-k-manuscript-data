Glassworker

Glass from Lorraine is smoother & more even than
plate glass and it is sturdier & more durable. But commonly
it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens
because the glassmakers, having made it, put it when totally
hot on straw, which stains it in this way. However, this
is removed with varnish & salt & other
drugs that the glassworkers put on. Glass from Lorraine is sold by the bundle & each
bundle is composed of three tablets.
The bundle costs usually x sous.
Plate glass is <-sold in-> made in France, it is
whiter & clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from
Lorraine. It is also commonly blown & in that case, it is
better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the
shape of a frame, because they cannot be set quite evenly.



Plate glass is sold by paniers. Every
panier contains 24 plates that are
commonly sold at x or twelve lb.
