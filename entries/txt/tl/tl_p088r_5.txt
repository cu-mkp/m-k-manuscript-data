Dust keeps wheat from becoming infested with weevils. And to clean
it well when it is stained & as if rusty, pass ashes through
the sieve & mix them with the wheat, then
boult the whole with a boulting cloth of rough cloth or
canvas. The ashes will pass through & your
wheat will stay yellow, clean & very
beautiful.
