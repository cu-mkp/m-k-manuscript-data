  To
  
   tin
  
  nails well, and other work, they
  
   file
  
  their
work very neatly. Then to clean it well & rid it of grease, they
make it boil in
  
   vinegar
  
  , then they wipe it well with a
  


     linen
    

   cloth
  
  . Next, they heat it & pass some
  
   rosin
  
  over the top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
  
   varnish
  
  . This done, they melt some
  
   pure & fine tin
  
  in
their
  


     estamiere
    


  , which is a little square
  
   iron
  
  box. And when the
  
   tin
  
  is well melted & moderately warm, they
throw in
  
   rosin
  
  to burn the
  
   filth
  
  , & then they let the
  
   head of a nail
  
  or something similar soak a little, & having
remained there for seven or eight
  

    pauses
   

  , they take
it out and shake it, hitting the top with an
  

    iron
   

  to
make the
  
   tin
  
  that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a
  
   small stick wrapped in
   
    tow
   

  . And if it is not well
  
   tinned
  
  , you will rub it hot with a piece of
  
   rosin
  
  & do
as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
which is a sign that the
  
   tin
  
  is the right temperature. But it
becomes blue if the
  
   tin
  
  is too hot. Things
  

    t
   

  thus
  
   tinned
  
  are durable & are not undone like
  
   tinning done
in leaf
  
  , thus at the end of a
  
   year
  
  , they can be clarified
& renewed by heating & rubbing them.
 


   Leadsmiths
  
  say that making a
  
   lizard
  
  die in the
melted
  
   tin
  

   it
   
    des
   

  makes the
  
   tinning
  
  become very golden. Or else putting in
  
   sal ammoniac
  
  .
