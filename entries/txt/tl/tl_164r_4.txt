Blowing

When you melt silver &amp; gold, do not blow strongly

&amp; with violence, because with the charcoal

consolidating, the crucible would lower &amp;

l'arg could fall over. But when your mold is

ready, at that moment, blow strongly to heat well the silver or

gold. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with

small bellows, especially gold, for this removes their

fumes &amp; softens them.
