 For
 
  gilding
 
 on
 
  wood
 

  First one needs to put down a layer of
  
   very clear glue
  
  , and
once dry, you will put down a layer of
  
   yellow gold
  
  . And when it is
done, you will take
  

    fig tree
   
   wood
  
  , & put it to soak
some space of time, & wash the places you want to
  
   gild
  
  , and
cut your
  
   gold
  
  with a
  
   knife
  
  to the price that you will
lay. And one must lay the said
  
   gold
  
  with
  

    cotton
   



    ie
   

  .
  

  And if you can find a
  
   fig tree
  
  ,
take the
  
   the white of one egg
  
  & stir it vigorously.
 

  If your
  
   gold
  
  does not have beautiful enough color, you will take
a
  

    partridge
   
   feather
  
  , & make it burn in a
  
   chafing-dish
  
  , and make the
  
   smoke
  
  go against what you have
  
   gilded
  
  .
