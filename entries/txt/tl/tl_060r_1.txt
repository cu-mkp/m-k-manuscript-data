First whitening of a panel

One layers two or three times with chalk tempered with

distemper glue on the panel, not with a

paintbrush but with a brush in such a

way as if you wanted to pounce, &amp; leave to dry. And reiterate up to

two or three times, then even out the last ground well with a

knife, then give a coat of glue on top, upon

which you will next be able to make your imprimatura and then paint. But

make sure that your first white is not too thick for it would break

easily. Flemish painters have such panels

made by the dozen.
