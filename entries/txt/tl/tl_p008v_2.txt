Or and argent moulu

You need to calcine your fine gold with
â˜¿ and then cleanse your amalgam well & make the
said mercury fly off. Next grind it on marble
with gum water. As for silver one needs to take it as
is & eat away at it with aquafortis, then take it out with a copper blade
& rinse it thoroughly and next grind it with gum water.
