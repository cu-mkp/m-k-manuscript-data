Couleur for gold or mixture



Verdigris & sal ammoniac, as much of one as the
other, & as much as a bean of
saltpeter. For if you put a quantity in it, it would make it all boil
so much that it would boil over. Saltpeter is only put in to make
it boil, in order that one recognizes when the substance has boiled
enough.
    
    


 This couleur, put on brittle melted gold,
renders it soft immediately.
