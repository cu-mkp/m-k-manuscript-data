For varnishing

Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because it

is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the wood like that

of spike lavender &amp; sandarac. Also, that of spike

lavender does not require any glue on iron &amp;

similar things that do not absorb. But on wood &amp; on colors

which have do not have gum or 

distemper glue, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said

hide glue &amp; to let it dry &amp; to

varnish.
