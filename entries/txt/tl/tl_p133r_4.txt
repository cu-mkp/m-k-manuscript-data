Clamps and broken mold

When you have made the first reheating & removed the
clamps, and you have <-the-> opened your mold
to clean it by blowing with quicksilver, which is used only in
enclosed molds, close the mold again & put the
clamps on again, but not in the first place where they were.
Lute again & dry again. But if it is for a cast with
silver or gold, lute with the remainder of the sand
that was used, for it is the safest. If your mold, while
reheating, is broken, you can adjust it with some clamps &
lute.
