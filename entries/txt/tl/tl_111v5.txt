Composition of sand

Once everything is reheated as said above, take four 4 full
crucibles of plaster, two 2 of brick,
& one of feather alum. Do not pass through the
sieve to mix <-may-> because the
alum would not pass. Mix with your
hands until neither one nor the other, neither white
nor red, can be discerned among the other. If your plaster were not
strong, do not mix in at all so much feather alum, because
it softens the molds. Take heed also that your sand is not hot
(since it has immediately been reheated) <-C-> when you
will want to mix it with water, for this <-them->
makes molds too soft & breakable.







You may sometimes diminish the quantity of plaster if you do not
find it strong enough to withstand fire & if it cracks,
<-&-> in order that the part of pestled tiles holds up, with
the feather alum, which you can also increase so that
it creates a better bond.
