Painting large figures

You need to put your charcoal at the tip of a stick
such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close,
you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain
& sufficient distance. Also, <-you-> when you paint up close, hold your
charcoal at the farthest end, & <-de-> practically with your
fingertips. For in this way you will acquire an
artist's stroke & <-l-> will render your hand
nimble.
