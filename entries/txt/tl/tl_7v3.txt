For relieving the pain of

Take half a lb of finely pulverized golden & yellow
marcasite, half an ounce of storax, 4 lb
of urine, incorporate everything well together, little by little,
in a mortar, then boil all together quite thoroughly. But the
pot needs to be well covered in order that the fumes do not
exhale. Next distil the <-it is-> urine, imbibed &
separated by inclination, in an alembic, well-luted & covered
with a copper helmet & soak a linen
cloth with the said water & apply it lukewarm on the
pain.
