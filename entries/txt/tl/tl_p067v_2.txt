Bones of the foot of oxen for sand

Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very
neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the
flame of straw. But if you mold them en noyau, give it
its first layer, simple & very thin, with a
paintbrush, & leave to dry at ease. Next, fortify the
following layers with wadding mixed with the said tempered
sand of bone.



It is the neatest sand that can be found for copper.
