Plaster

It is necessary that it be well cooked, which you will recognize

when cooking it in an iron or metal pot, you

mix it with an iron rod, &amp; if it attaches to the

iron, it is not cooked enough, if not, it is good. The

water with which you temper it should be a little warm &amp; the

mold made with the aforesaid earth also a little hot.

The work of plaster does not last &amp; the faces &amp; delicate

things break if one does not give a coat of glue.
