  Wax
 
 portraits
 
  If they are painted with colors on the
  
   wax
  
  , & if the
  
   wax
  
  is not
  


     en
    


  tinted & mixed with color within, the color lifts
off & is undone if you mold them
  
   en noyau
  
  , but the portrait
is not spoiled. One needs to
  
   oil
  
  them lightly, bathing in
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  & tempering with
  
   hot water
  
  . If they are
varnished, one needs to mold them two or three times to lift off the
  
   varnish
  
  , which sticks to the
  
   mold
  
  . After it is removed,
you will be able to mold nealy. If they are on
  
   wood
  
  , one needs to
saturate the
  
   wood
  
  with
  
   very hot melted wax
  
  , for otherwise the
  
   mold
  
  would be attached to it.
  
   Lead white
  
  is much better
for mixing with
  
   white wax
  
  than
  
   ceruse
  
  , for
  
   lead
white
  
  is firmer & whiter.
