  jasper
 


   Thin
   
    glass
   
   for this effect is very beautiful.
  


  Take
  
   horn
  
  from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, &
underneath make the figure of your
  
   jasper
  
  ,
  
   cornalines
  
  ,
& other
  
   stones
  
  , which will be a work more appropriate than on
  
   glass
  
  , which is too shiny. And the
  
   horn
  
  presents a luster
& fatty polish like
  
   jasper
  
  .
 

  You know how, with scrapings of the said
  
   horn
  
  ,
  

    roses
   

  can be imitated. The
  
   horn
  
  colors for
this
  
   jasper
  
  want to have a base with
  
   clear turpentine
  
  or
  

    spike lavender
   
   varnish
  
  .
  
   And colors matte in body
are not so appropriate here, although they are very beautiful.
  

   One
needs to
   
    oil
   
   the unpainted reverse with
   

     spike
lavender
    
    oil
   
   .
  


  You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the
  
   filings of talc or of pins
  
  on the fresh
  
   cement
  
  of the said
joints. One needs to join them with
  
   gum ammoniac
  
  soaked in
  
   vinegar
  
  . To better counterfeit
  
   mottled jasper
  
  , apply
  
   wool with thick hairs
  
  dyed in diverse colors & intermingled.
After you have layered all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them,
then layer
  
   gold & silver leaf
  
  . If you layer on the
  
   horn
  
  colors of
  
   turpentine
  
  , give it a base of
  
   silver
  
  or of
  
   tin leaf
  
  . You can also
  
   file
  

   horn
  
  & mix
it with
  
   strong glue
  
  , & layer it onto the joints of the
piece of
  
   horn
  
  , then even it with a
  
   joiner's plane
  
  .
