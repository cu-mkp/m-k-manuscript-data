Grafts

I

It is necessary that the graft be not from old wood, for it is never

a beautiful tree.

One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when

it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, &amp; it

does not have enough strength to bud.

Trees which have coarse marrow, like peach trees &amp; all

their kind &amp; plum trees, do not want grafts in

freezing weather because the cold damages their marrow, which one

also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the

graft.

All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree is sapping,

for the humor grows them quickly. Otherwise

au they dry before the humor of

the sap pushes them.
