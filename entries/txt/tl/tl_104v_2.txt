For casting

If you have some piece which will not release &amp; is big,

mold it with wax, either in hollow or in relief, because it is

malleable once soft &amp; obeys, and thus separates itself from the

piece without leaving anything. But take heed that the melted wax

be neither too hot nor too cold. Some mold with wax heated in

hot water, but in pressing, the mold becomes clumsy 

&amp; makes itself false. When you have the hollow wax form, you can cast in some

very soft clay &amp; thoroughly moistened &amp; clear, &amp; let it dry

at ease. Then you will make a hollow form on it ave of

lead or tin, in tu which what you will

form will be of good release.
