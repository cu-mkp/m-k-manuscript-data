Eau magistra

Some people think that salt water is not good, because the

salt cracks in fire, &amp; consequently should make it porous. There is only the wine boiled with elm

root.

Charcoal for pouncing makes for a good release, but

one finds that the one of willow makes it porous. The one

of oak or beech does make it porous well without making it

porous.

Try burnt oysters.
