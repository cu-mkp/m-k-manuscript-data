+Flowers
        

When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves
upright, pass a thread through the mold to keep them
from rising up, &amp; cast the sand little by little, &amp; always blow
strongly in order that it settles everywhere, otherwise it will become
lumpy.
        

Because you did not put in this a clay slab, the
mold sometimes holds to the table where you cast it.
To undo it, hit a great blow of a hammer at the side of the
table.






It is enough to reheat your luted mold once for flowers
&amp; to heat it the second time if you cast with tin &amp;
lead, for with gold &amp; silver, one needs to
reheat it twice.


Cast your tin very red in the mold, of
such heat that you can hold your finger
there without harm in the hole.
