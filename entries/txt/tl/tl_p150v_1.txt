however, do not remove it until you have completely repaired the
turtle, for you will use this earth as cement if
you need to embed something or repair with the small chisel. If
there is some flashing at the joints of the mold, you will remove
it, either with the burin called a
chaple or a very sharp penknife,
or with a small file, & then with the small
chisel, always having the natural one, to do this better, in
front of you. You can curl on a file the point of a small
chisel which is not quenched to make something lumpy. For these
<-two-> turtles & hollow things that
presuppose being large enough, cast your alloy of half
lead & half fine tin. There is more work in
molding a turtle than for twelve molds of flowers. If
there is some crocum in your sand, there will not be
flashing, & if, by some chance, there is some on the sides, it will be
thinner than paper, as long as your mold is tightened
well with a press.
    
    
 And to make the scales of turtles
or other animals, you can make some little small chisels in
the fashion of a round cutting-punch, others in the fashion of a
gouge or the scale of a snake & lizard,
and others on a file to make the curly & lumpy bits. The
turtles which are not molded hollow do not have as much work,
for they are molded in two pieces, to repair them with small
chisels, small cutting-punches, small gouges
& small serrated chisels.

    










the white wax with which you have composed your black
sulfured wax, has such little substance, since being dry and
purified, that it leaves nothing inside, and flows very gently. As for
the charcoal which is mixed in, if some remains, it burns &
reduces to ash & is emptied afterward by blowing through
the gate. You could even open your mold after the wax
has melted, if there is no fanciful thing which could break, like some
reattached thing or similar. After having covered the clamps
with the lute from your sand & having covered all of the
mold, give it on top a layer of common lute, & then
sprinkle this with some pestled brick, in order that you can
handle it better. Let the lute dry slowly before firing it,
which melts the wax. The wax having left through the gate,
that which remains with the charcoal will burn. Being reheated
for the first time, lute it <-pou-> once more,
<-to reheat it the second time-> because the plaster, not
being good, will have readily made the mold retract, and the
joints will crack open, which might make large flashing. And for the second
time, one ought not to reheat it if you only want to cast in
lead or tin, but rather only make sure that the
lute is quite dry & the mold moderately hot. For
these turtles that have a large size & enough thickness, it
is better to <-mold ault-> cast <-your
lead-> an alloy half of lead &
half of tin, especially for hollow things. For, if you
only have very thin & very weak things to cast, like flowers, rely
rather on the abundance of lead than of tin, which becomes
porous once cast a little thick, & readily makes some flaw around
the cast. Maistre Alexandre says that he has never gone wrong
with half tin & half lead for things
weighty & with the thickness of the back of a
knife. If there is crocum, the joints hardly
appear, & consequently, the flashing is very small & thin. You can
repair & through the hole of the belly, pull the earth of the
core, leaving it wet a long time;



When you have cast your black wax in the <-a->
mold, & when it is quite cold, you need to <-the->
open your mold halfway, to make the cast. And if the
figure of black wax breaks, there is no danger, for it
can always be reattached with a hot iron <-touching->
point. Or else, if the pieces are not separated from the
mold, <-qu-> they meet up & join like
beforehand by joining & binding well the two halves of the
mold. When the figure is large, one needs to cross
inside many iron wires to sustain the core.

    






A
only in lead or
tin. One needs,
however, to redden
the mold nearly as
much as if there were
inside some
animal to burn,
    

in order that the
wax melts well & leaves nothing inside & flows on its
own by keeping the mold leaning toward the gate when
reheating it. And when the mold is reheated, leave it to cool
gently, then blow inside, and draw toward yourself, while sucking, in
order that the ashes of the wax come out. Do this with
bellows.








Molding hollow

This iron wire point, which is put thus
<-bi-> through the hole, is to better hold the 
core & keep it from shifting. All of this being
<-d-> thus arranged, lay your mold on the
table, the hole at the top, as it is marked here on the side,
& then adapt a circle of soft clay
<-aultr->, two fingers high, around
the hole, like for other molds. And then temper your molding sand
moderately thick, & cast it through the hole until it is well [<-well->]
filled, up to the surface of the clay circle. But take
heed to not cast <-r-> in through the middle of the
hole, but rather from the side, for, since the already made
mold drinks and sucks the moisture <-of the new->, the
new one that you cast in <-which dries quickly-> on the edge of
the mold, being quickly dry, <-s-> would
obstruct the mold, & it would not finish filling. And when
you cast from the side, if you recognize that it is obstructed, you can
clear a path. Having cast in, blow on the <-f->
[<-the->] wet gate, & put the
end of your finger in the hole a few times, <-po->
or some small point, to unblock it, & make the hollow
wax fill up. Cast in, at the end, the sand, tempered a little
thick to give strength to the mold, for water coming
to the surface <-s-> of the mold
always makes it softer. Having set, scrape off the clay
circle & the excess which is on the hole through which you
cast the noyau, & nothing will be discernable. When your
mold is thus prepared, lute it all around with the
same sand which served for the molds. Next, reheat it in a slow
fire at the beginning, & the mouth of the gate at the bottom, in
order that the wax flows out gently. For if you were
to give it great heat until the wax came out, it would boil
inside & leave some pustules & lumpy things, although





This point is placed in the middle & through the hole of
the gate when the mold is in several pieces, like a
turtle, and this is done in order that the core does
not shake. But when the mold is only of two pieces,
    



it is not necessary to put points in the middle of it.

    







Before casting the core, make some notches all around the hole
through which you want to cast, in order to always better secure the
mold.



Mixed tallow is the reason that, when emptying the wax,
the hole does not become obstructed. One needs half
tallow & half black wax.



All very thick pieces come out better in hollow, because a thick mass of
mostly lead remains hot a long time & eats the
mold.



You can, after the cast is done, mold <-a-> the part of the shell
of the belly where you have made the hole on the natural
one, and reattach it with
solder.



X Note that, after your
core is cast, it is
better to put the mold
in hot water to open it, in order
to remove the most wax that you can, always softening
<-a-> it in hot water. For the less wax
that remains in it, the better, in order that, when reboiling in large quantity in
the mold when you reheat it, no pustules or lumps are made in
it. And then, if there is hardly any wax, you will not need to
reheat it as much. When opening the mold, the cast will break.
But it can easily be repaired, even though you
cast A
