For ga cach cages

You can embellish them with enamel cannules of
various colors by covering the latten or iron wire with the said
cannules. These you will break neatly to the length that you
want if you slightly notch with a cutting file the place to
be broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend
them with a wood model over a
chafing-dish or else by the heat of the lamp. It can
also be drawn as long as you want in a small furnace made like
a reverberatory furnace but which is pierced on both sides. And
when the large cannule is red, they seize the hot end using
small pincers with a long beak, such that one prong of the beak
of the small pincers enters inside the end of the 
cannule, & thus it is lengthened without becoming stopped, &
the other end of the cannule is held with the hand,
because it is not hot. When the cannule is stretched enough,
the one who works seated, having his furnace
the size of a carnation pot before him,
breaks it off & continues. This is for making 
cannules for capes, which are cut, as said, with a
file. Glass button makers also avail themselves of
the said furnace.










Under the door is a grate that supports the lit charcoal, &
the ash is emptied by turning the furnace upside
down.
