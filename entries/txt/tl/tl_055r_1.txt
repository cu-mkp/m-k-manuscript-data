For firing a schioppo senza rumore

Warm the pipe well &amp; plug the touch-hole below, &amp; take a piece of porkfat, the freshest

that you can, as long as the joint of the little

finger &amp; of the caliber, &amp; put it in the pipe &amp;

move it up and down until it is completely melted. Next, load the pipe

at the top with a socket that is

held on the ramrod, as you know, &amp; it will only make a

little whistle.
