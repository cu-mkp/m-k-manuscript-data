Molding bouquets, plants, and flowers

        

 One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they

ont wilt &amp; dry out. Dip them, therefore,

immediately in good eau-de-vie &amp; then put them in your

tempered sand mold, like snakes. For which one needs no

release, for while the molds are being 

reheated s s, the plant burns, which does not happen with

animals that have bones &amp; q. It is necessary

that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes

because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.
