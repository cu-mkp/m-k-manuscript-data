Gate



It is necessary that it be longish with regard to the thing that you
molded. And for big molds, at the very least, it is necessary
that it have four or five fingers of length. You can
make it wide up until the middle & then divide it in three points in
this way. And as much as the molded thing will be small, it is also necessary
that your points be small. And in the middle of the gate & of its
points, make there some openings in order to prevent the fury of the
metal & make it run gently. One also needs to
c conjoin the folded parts of the animal with little
notched lines, a especially the end of the tail or
other delicate part, in order that the metal flows everywhere
& carries itself from e l one part to the
other.



Do not forget to make a gate of wax for the feet of 
    
lizards & delicate things like this.





When you have molded an animal in the first part of the
mold, do not let this part dry before you have taken away the
said animal, for the mold, in drying, contracts and would also
make the animal contract. Keep it therefore in some moist &
humid place until you have

 done it.
