as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste, & that it is
not so easy to handle as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is
cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws off big bubbles or
exhalations, in the middle & around, as long as a
finger. Seeing it in this state, remove it from the
fire, for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it
would be too much & would not set as well. For when it becomes red
& overheats, it loses its strength & spoils the sand. Leave it
to cool before mixing it with the other sands. And when it is cold,
mix and mold, for the sooner after its cooking you use it, the
sooner it will set.
