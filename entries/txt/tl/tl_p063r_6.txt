Verdigris and another very beautiful bright green

One ought not to grind it with water alone, for that makes it
die. To render it beautiful in distemper, some grind it with
vinegar, but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To
render it beautiful, grind it with urine & leave to dry.
Then, whenever you like, grind it with oil. And after you have
collected it with the spatula, before finishing to clean the
marble, grind stil de grain yellow on it. And you
will have a very beautiful green.
