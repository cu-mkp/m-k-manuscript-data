From nature

        

There are some who paint from nature on oiled paper, &amp;

if they do not finish in one go, they put their paper &amp;

unfinished picture in water so that it shall not dry.

               

   

        

Illuminators painting on paper temper their colors

with gum &amp; mix in a little soap to make them run

better.

    

        

        

Painters must all learn how to depict after nature, for to them

it is travel provisions &amp; revenue &amp; sure means of earning their

passage when travelling across the lands with only their

cocon.
