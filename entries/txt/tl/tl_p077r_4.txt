Recipe for making bronze and varnish of many
sorts

For making excellent varnish with clear water which
you will use with a paintbrush and immediately dry, for
putting on paper, a tablet, or another piece.

First, you will take five ounces of eau-de-vie
and one ounce of benzoin pestled between
two pieces of paper or card or in a mortar,











but it should not be too small, then take  a
glass vial not too big and put into it a half of these
two, namely two & a half ounces. Next take the said
benzoin just as coarsely pestled, and put it to use with the
said water and let it rest for the space of one & half
days, & then take the said water &
put it into another glass vial & mix it very well.
And on the rest of the said benzoin that remains at the bottom of
the said first vial, put the rest of the water over this,
and do as before when you see that the case is going well, and mix the
first water with the second. By means of this you will be able to
use it for something more noble.
