Counterproofing

Make some soap water & with this, rub & moisten the
engraved piece that you want to counterproof from, then lay white
paper on it & rub very vigorously across the top with a
tooth or the bottom of a glass & you will
transfer your printed piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but
if you oil your paper with spike lavender&or turpentine oil, it will show
reverse the right way around on the other side. Then follow
these lines with a paintbrush or a quill, then heat the
paper & the oil will go away & leave your
paper white. And if you want this not to be known, if, by chance,
you borrowed the piece, moisten the paper and the polishing that
the burnisher has made on the back, which shows what has been
done, will not be known. The soap water will turn the piece
yellow, but well-gummed water, which has the same effect, does
not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make gummed
water, then mix some soap in it & do as is said.
