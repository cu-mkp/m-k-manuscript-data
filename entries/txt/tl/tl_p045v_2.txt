 For adjusting a crooked
 
  cannon
 

  Take off the breech and place it on an
  
   smooth & well-leveled
table
  
  and pass through the inside a
  
   very smooth string without
knots
  
  , on each end of which there should be a
  

    plumb
   

  hanging from each side. Then look into the
  
   barrel
  
  along the
  
   string
  
  , and if it does not touch equally all over, note the
place where it does not touch & hit with a
  
   hammer
  
  on the outside on
that side & in the same place, & thus it will be righted, &
do thus all the way round.
