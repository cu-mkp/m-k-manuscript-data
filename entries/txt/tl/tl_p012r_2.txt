Chimolée

The terre chimolée, otherwise known as
fuller's earth, with which they dress the
cloth, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you
want to reheat it, it must first be warm, & reheat it on a gentle
fire at a distance & little by little, otherwise it would crack.
Put the figure to reheat in a pot in an oven or in a
covered oven. It is very soft, neat & beautiful. You
can make a hollow form of animals from chimolée & cast
lead in it.





The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 days before you reheat
it. When you mold & make a hollow form from chimolée, do
not press suddenly, but gently, for it would crack.
