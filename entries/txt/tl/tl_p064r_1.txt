Working neatly

Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But
next, having made your design carefully, keep the place of shadows for
them alone, & also separately that of lights & highlights,
without layering one color all over & then highlighting or else shading
on it. And in this way, you further your work, economize your colors
& work neatly. Which is the reason that, the colors not being
muddled nor mixed together, they do not die & you soften the colors
better, since they are not so thick.
