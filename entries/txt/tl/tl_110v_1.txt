Molds

There is nothing better for opening them up than to anoint them with

olive oil, &amp; nothing else. And next, when you

want to unjoin them, soak them in cold water, which is the

secret. LAnd you will see that the

oil, although it seems to be imbued, will detach itself, like

grease. Molds become stronger in cold water. And hot

water would dissolve them awkwardly, although once reheated, they

are more handleable &amp; easier to dissolve in the

water.
