Molds

For those which in which one needs to burn something and

which do not open before being reheated, one does not make any casts

before it is reheated. For large molds in which the gate is big

and ample, it is necessary that the gate be well notched &amp;

scratched, in order that the weight of the metal does not go with

much force. They make hardly any flashing if they are pressed. But before

pressing them, put between them and the press some pieces

of plump &amp; thick felt, which is hardly yet crushed, for it fills the concavities &amp; keeps the mold from

cracking. The clamps should be placed before reheating or

drying it.

When the earth from which you make the earthen

slab to arrange your animal is too soft, the points that

you put in it come out easily &amp; come undone when you cast in the

sand, &amp; thus the mold spoils and the shape comes undone.

Therefore, when you recognize that your slab will be too tender &amp; soft, spread on top some hot ashes &amp; blow with

the bellows.
