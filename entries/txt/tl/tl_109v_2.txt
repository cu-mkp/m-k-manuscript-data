Killing snakes for molding

Some put a drop of aquafortis in the mouth,

which stuns them well, such that the head &amp; the part behind

seem to be dead but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it

with a needle to fit it to the mold, it moves &amp;

spoils &amp; undoes everything. Therefore, to put them to death entirely, put it

in a bottle of good vinegar &amp; some eau-de-vie. And do thus with lizards &amp; other similar

beasts.

If you want to keep them, you can put them in a pipe full of

earth in a garden outdoors. But your pipe

must be covered with archal wire, for otherwise it would

climb &amp; go up very high.
