Sand

One can find an excellent one on the little hill of
Puy David near Thoulouse
for lead, tin & copper. It does not want to be
too much reheated because, drying out all at once, it loses its
bond & burns at the first arrival of metal, which makes
the work lumpy & not neat. It is better to reheat from a distance,
rather than with a straw flame, which generates
some some filth. Before filling in the frame, you can put in the finest sand you have in a very fine
linen, & dry pounce the medal and then the moistened sand
that you put on top, which has more body, will grip it.



Tallow makes it porous.



Fixed mercury mixed in when one wants to cast, makes
metal lead run. But if it is pure, one ought to cast
very hot so that it runs. And vents.
