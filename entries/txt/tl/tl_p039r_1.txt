Goldsmith

They assemble silver filings with saltpeter which
refines it & does not make it brittle. But gold filings are
assembled with borax or, to save the borax, with
lead, which refines the gold & softens it, for the
saltpeter would make it brittle, which silver does not do.
This is why, to save money, goldsmiths use it to assemble, in
order to save borax, which costs viii sous per
ounce, & saltpeter x sous per
lb.

When goldsmiths have thus assembled their silver
filings with saltpeter, a red enamel vitrifies at the
bottom of the crucible. I do not know if the copper
mixed in with the silver is the cause. Try for
enamel.
