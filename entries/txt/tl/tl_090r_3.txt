That any sand can be rendered good

Artisans who work in large works &amp; who need to further

their profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she

does not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time they would

use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing sands, seek

the one of the s mines,

which is not too fatty, the one that is a kin of earth, not too lean &amp;

consequently without bond, but rather that which is pulled from the

depths of the sand-bed in bricks &amp; clods that show

its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which

has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found soft

when handling it between the fingers. And

because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous

areas or lean territories, &amp; akin to the 

arene, it cannot be found in in the

surroundings of all the bonnes villes where

artisans willingly gather. And thus, if they do

not have it close to their house, they prefer to have it come

from afar, like from Lyon, Venice, Paris near the

Sainct Chappelle &amp; similar places, rather than prepare it.

However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the

sand from a mine

good &amp; proper for molding. For if it is coarse, pass it through a

sieve, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, &amp; when

the water has rested a little, empty that which is still

troubled in some separate vessel. The coarse will promptly 

fall down to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which

will have come from the troubled water, set apart, having

settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough

bond, grind it quite dry on porphyry, &amp; you will

render it impalpable, &amp; which will have bond like chalk.

Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it &amp; again will grind it &amp; mix it with salts, or linen, or burnt

felt, or ashes of paper &amp; similarly washed things.
