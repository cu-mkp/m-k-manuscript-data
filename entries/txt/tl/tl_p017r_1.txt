The large cannon, which is for great
batteries, commonly weighs fifty-five or lx
quintals. At the breech it carries the thickness of
<-b-> two balls & one 
<-l->of the three parts of one ball. At the front, it carries
<-ba-> the thickness of one ball &
<-two-> two of the three parts. It is thirteen or fourteen
pans long. But they are very troublesome to drive. The
head-on battery, to accomplish its task quickly <-is-> &
batter with great force, is at <-d-> one-hundred fifty
paces & at two hundred. <-And-> It is true that one
batters well from three or 4 hundred paces, but it is necessary
to give it more powder. Its common load is <-p->
of xx lb of powder, its ball of 40 lb. One
needs xxv horses to draw it. When one fires it farther than its
usual range, one puts in a half ladle of cannon
powder more. A cannon can fire
4xx or a hundred shots per
day, but one needs to refresh it every time after one
has fired <-di-> nine or ten shots, if the battery is steadily
continued. For if there is a break, it is not necessary to refresh it as
often. For two quintals of copper, or two quintals
& a half if it is for large cannons, one puts one
quintal of metal. # The
metal is composed at the beginning of eight lb of
tin for one quintal of rosette, while
for large bells one only puts six lb of fine tin for one
quintal of rosette, to give it a bigger
voice. For the more tin there is, the clearer the
sound is. <-Its-> For gun founding, if one provides the
material & charcoal, as one commonly does, for
masters do not have the means, one gives x to xii
lb per quintal. And <-for the mat-> when the
master provides everything, one gives him 40 lb,
according to the King’s ordinance, per
quintal for large pieces <-&-> such as cannons, and for
small pieces, L lb. For the more material there is,
the more profit the master has of it. One founds another kind
of cannon-perriers of xxx quintals which are longer than the
others, and easily eight pans long, & they are for
battering defenses & casemates, <-s->
placing them via trenches on the edge of the ditch
by night.

On each side of the opening of the breech they give the thickness of
half a ball. And then they also add on each side the third part
of a ball.



<-Ain->
One gives it two ladles of
cannon powder for its charge, & one & a half of
arquebus powder, & the same for the others.





#

The composition of cannons of France is of one quintal of
metal for two of rosette.
But those of Toulouse & Poncet  puts 
iii of rosette & one of metal.



The rosette for re-melting is more profitable than
cauldrons, which turn entirely into filth.





Old pieces are composed of almost <-de dem-> as much
of one as of the other, namely one part of
rosette & one of metal. One recognizes this
composition with a burin. For its substance is found to be brittle
& the particle taken from the burin is found to be mixed
with yellow & white.












pieces. The falconet is loaded with a ladle, and one
commonly gives it only one ladle. There are also
other falconets weighing three quintals, and which
are nine pans long. Their ball weighs half a
lb. Their charge is a quarter of powder. It is loaded
either with a ladle, but more commonly with a charge. At the
breech, 3 balls, & 2 in front. To the small pieces which
are under 3 quintals one gives them at least 3 balls
& a twelfth part of a ball at the breech, & sometimes
takes away from the front to make this addition to the breech, according
to the length one gives them.





The strength of the piece is at the level of the trunnion, which is the
point of departure of the lit powder.





The strength of the berche is at the
maslée, & at the back of the
breech.





A double musket weighs 2 quintals, is seven
pans long, carries a ball of a quarter of a

lb or a little less. At the breech 3 balls, two in
front. One loads it with as much powder as ball, up to the top of
the escutcheon, which in these small pieces can amount to 3

or 4 balls of arquebus powder. For if one uses
cannon powder, one can load it to a thickness of <-c->
five balls.





One needs to understand all of this as iron balls. When one
shoots a metal ball, one over-charges by a quarter
ladle because if a cannon ball weighs 40
lb, the metal one weighs lx lb. One also takes
the gun-sight higher when shooting a metal ball. For if one
shoots an [<-iron->] iron ball point-blank, one takes six lines
higher when shooting metal balls. A metal ball <-makes->
alloyed with copper, in order that it is not frangible, is more
effective hitting at close range than that of iron. But the
iron one hits more fiercely from afar. 



A simple musket weighs one quintal, is six
pans long. <-carries a ball weighing [illegible]
qu-> One has no consideration for those which are under two
quintals, which readily carry lead balls
<-un-> of the weight of the ball, but of the caliber.
However, those which can receive balls of metal or iron do
better because they will penetrate more than six lead ones. Its
charge is up to the escutcheon, namely the thickness of 4
balls. 



Arquebus à croc weighs lx lb, that is to say the large one is
five pans long, its charge is up to the
escutcheon, namely the length of 4 balls, it

carries lead balls, and is for the defence of houses. Of these
arquebus à croc, both the large & the small ones, one makes orgues
which are <-or-> appropriate for an assault, both outside &
inside the place. They are founded separately as if to serve for uses
other than orgues. See the 4th leaf following, marked

    













The average weighs 18 quintals &
measures xii pans long.
Its ball weighs eight or 9 lb & its charge is six
pounds of powder. <-And for-> At the breech it
carries a thickness of three balls, & in front, two. It is
more appropriate for the defense of a city than for battery.
However, one takes it sometimes either to break a barricade
or to support the battery after the cannons have fired, in order to
prevent the assailed from re-fortifying after the cannons have played or
fired. Four horses can draw it. It shoots eight or nine hundred 
paces at point-blank & almost as much as the
bastarde.





To cannons & large pieces one gives<-n-> as much
powder as is the diameter of a ball & a half, at
which point the escutcheon sits. To medium pieces, such as
field pieces, & smaller ones, one gives them powder the
thickness of two balls. To the passe-volant & other smaller
ones, one gives them powder the thickness of three
balls. In general, one charges all pieces up to the
escutcheon. One charges with the ladle all
pieces from the cannon to the piece of four quintals
<-de char->, and one gives them two
ladles of cannon powder or one & a half
of arquebus powder. To smaller ones, one only gives one
ladle, & those of one quintal are
charged with a small charge.



The field piece weighs ten or twelve quintals & is ten
pans long or 12. Its ball weighs vi or vii lb
& its charge is 4 lb of powder. At the breech it has
three balls & two in front, as do all pieces that are smaller than
the average. One gives them more of a breech because one makes them
longer in proportion, and also because in a house or
elsewhere one fires them more frequently than the large pieces.
Their caliber is also small, which makes the breech 3 balls
thick. They are used for following a camp promptly & for the defense
of cities & houses, putting them on the
walls or on a tower. One needs three good
horses for drawing it.



The passe-volant weighs vi quintals, is eight or nine
pans long. Its ball weighs two lb, &, for
its charge, a lb & a half of powder. At the breech
it has three balls & two in the front. Two horses can move
it, for a single horse does not begin to move a piece. It is
used for the defense of houses, or for taking among the
infantry to break a rank of cavalry.



The falconet weighs 4 quintals, is x
pans long. Its ball weighs one lb & a
quarter, its charge is half a lb of powder. At the
breech three balls, at the front, two. To move it, two horses,
although such pieces are hardly moved insofar as they only serve to
defend houses. The ones which are carted around either for
battery or for siege combat, are cannons, culverins, medium-sized
bastardes & field








On the gunner



The cannon fires at point-blank from five to six hundred paces.
But not for battering, in which it can only perform well from two
hundred paces, or three hundred <-paces-> at
the most, and it should not be any farther. Its ball commonly weighs 40
lb of the King’s caliber. There is
a cannon-perrier, which weighs xxv quintals, which are
small, short cannons. It is for fighting the ditch casemates
& for battering at close range. It bears a large ball of the
King’s caliber like the others, namely of
40 lb. It bears in the breech only the width of two balls
& a quarter of a ball. The front only bears the width of
one ball & a third of a ball. Its charge is similar to those of
bigger ones, namely xx lb. And for this reason, when one wants to try them
<-[illegible]->, one ought not to over-charge it, for this damages the
piece. And for the first time & until it has fired five or six
<-pieces-> shots, it is better not to give its complete charge,
for the piece is still proving itself. And the test that one can do is
to give it a charge of xx lb of fine arquebus powder
instead of ordinary cannon powder. And four good horses
are sufficient to drag them. They are easy, & close up they have as
much force as the big ones, especially for private houses
& small towns & fortresses of little
importance. They are no more subject to bursting than the others
because they are short. For that which gives great strength to the
powder & puts the piece in danger of bursting is
the length of the piece, because the powder is burned entirely
before exiting, & <-the-> its impetuosity is held constrained
for longer in a <-small-> long piece than a
<-gr-> short one. The cannon-perrier is commonly seven to
eight pans long. It is true that this is a
pan of Montpellier & not a
King’s pan, which is not used in the
founding of cannons for making them good. For the pan of
Montpellier being <-of-> shorter, the cannons
<-more-> proportioned there are shorter also, & compensate in
thickness <-ce-> the length that they would have by the
King’s pan, by which measure they
will be found longer. But also they would be thinner. The <-e->
<-great-> <-cano-> strength of the cannon-perrier for
making a battery is 4xx paces.


<-The double canon->
    

The great cannon, because of the weight of its ball, carries
a range of only a thousand or xii hundred paces without
landing, & bouncing, it commonly bounces iii times.





The cannon-perrier does not have a large effect if not close.





One recognizes the good alloy of a piece by seeing it. For if, with the
greenness which they expel on the surface, they redden, that is to say
that they are composed of a sufficient quantity of
rosette. If not, they are only of metal, which
shows up whitish. If they themselves do not make this demonstration,
scratch & you will see. 





The good alloy for pieces is of three parts of
rosette & one of the fine metal of
<-la-> large bells, where there is more
rosette than in the metal of small bells. The
metal commonly costs xv lb & fine
rosette xv or xvi.





The pan of Montpellier is equivalent
to six of the King’s inches, which
contains in it two common ones. 







It is necessary, for <-a-> mounting a piece well, that it be as
high at the side of the mouth as at the breech. Otherwise, one does not
mount well.










Large culverins <-are-> for battery & piercing
are forty quintals & eighteen pans long.
Their ball, of the King’s caliber & for
battery, is 30 lb and thus lighter than that of the cannon. And
thus, it does not carry so much ammunition for fifteen lb
suffices for its charge. The cannon makes a bigger opening due to the
size of its ball, but the culverin hits more fiercely & propels
faster, having greater force due to its length. At the breech it carries
the thickness of two of its balls & <-es->the 
<-three-> third part<-s-> of a ball, at the front the
thickness of one ball & two thirds. Culverins serve to
batter defenses from afar when one cannot easily make an approach, and
cannons approach more closely. They also serve to support the battery.
One needs fifteen or sixteen horses for moving it. They are
<-tout-> of the same alloy as the cannon, as are all
pieces <-that exceed-> smaller than average, for to
these, one adds a little more metal in order that the melt runs
better. And for two quintals of rosette, one
adds six twenties lb of metal for the smaller pieces.
They shoot 8 or 9 hundred paces at point-blank, & up to
a thousand paces if the powder is strong, &
half a league at range.





Some invented the loading of cannons with cartouches.





Some <-po-> do not put the powder in the cannon
all in one go but in two & ramming each time, saying that each
ramming raises & gives a further thumb’s breadth. But this
is not certain for large pieces which are loaded with a lot of
powder.





The bastarde, which is a <-culverin->
<-middle-sized-> piece,
weighs thirty quintals and its ball weighs <-xx
lb-> xv lb and carries as its charge x
or xii lb of powder. Its proportion is at the breech the
thickness of two of its balls & the<-es->
th<-ree->ird part<-s-> of a ball. At the front, the
thickness of a ball & two of three parts. <-or->
They serve to batter defences of little importance such as
gabions and garrets topped with a tower &
similar things. It is thirteen or xiiii pans long like
the large cannon. Ten horses can move it. It accompanies well
the large culverin for point-blank because it carries small
ammunition.





Some give it the thickness of three balls at the breech & at the
front of two balls.



The bastard culverin weighs 35 quintals & is xxv
pans long. It carries three balls at the breech &
two in front. Its ball is like that of the bastarde piece,
weighing xv lb. These are pleasure pieces which <-s-> cannot be moved by
carriage, but are for city defences. Some make these xxvii or
xxviii pans long, like the Cow of La
Rochelle. But to such pieces one gives reinforcement at the breech
as of three balls. At range, they can shoot around one league,
& a half league at point-blank. Its charge is like the
bastarde. And if one wants to fire at some cavalry
quite far off, one increases the powder a little. A tail of smoke
follows the ball which <-de-> guides your
sight [<-e->] to where the ball is going. This goes for the
cannon and for the culverin, and not for small pieces.
