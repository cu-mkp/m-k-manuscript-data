Molding de en noyau, with the same

sand, wax images or lead medals and suchlike

Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with wax

what does not, and then anoint your images of wax or of

lead with olive oil, very thinly &amp; very

lightly, such that the oil makes no thickness nor body on the

medal. Then, heat a little eau-de-vie,

until &amp; when it is lukewarm, moisten the oiled

medal with it, for if it is the water were cold, it

would reject the oil, it would not sit well on it. Next, cast your sand

of plaster, bri brick, &amp;

wet alum on top, having arranged your image on the clay

mandore &amp; having made a circle around it

de to give it the necessary thickness. These medals

are oiled and rubbed thus with eau-de-vie

because they are firm &amp; hard &amp; would not be malleable for taking

out of thee the mold, which is

tenacious, as are natural animals, which are soft &amp;

flexible.

When you have tempered your sand, do not cast it in the middle of the

mold but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently and

that the beginning is thin &amp; afterward thick. If your tempered sand

sounds like water falling in the mold, it is a sign that

is too thin. Make it, therefore, of medium thickness.
