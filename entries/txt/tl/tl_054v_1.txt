On dry preserves

    

To dry preserves take a which are not liquid, take an

open tub pierced on both sides with a small, square window,

&amp; pass sticks through these on one side and the other,

&amp; place on these a sieve made of strings in the form of a

net. And on this, you will properly arrange the vessels with your

preserves. And having put at the bottom of the tub a

chafing-dish or two, cover the tub with a

bedsheet folded double.
