Horsehair sieves

They are made at Coustance in Normandy with
horse tail hair which they clean with lye because
they sort them with the mouth & separate out short
& broken ones. They do not make the reed longer than the
sieve, & the reed is round. They attach to both edges of
the reed the hair, either black or white, according to
the work they want to make. And the weft is [<-is->]
done over & under as for making any other fabric. And passing a
small flat stick of ii or three fingers wide
between, next they pass two hairs at each step of the pedal
and weave with three pedals. There are xviic
hairs in the entire sieve. They sell them by the dozen & each dozen
xxx sous. They bring them to Toulouse to
transport them afterward to Spain, and take silk tammy
in exchange for it.
