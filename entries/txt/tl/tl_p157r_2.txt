  Some
  
   goldsmiths
  
  assay it on
  
   gold, thinly beaten
   

     esp
    

   & well burnished with a
   

     chaple
    


  . But it is better to assay it on a
  
   gold
ingot
  
  . And also assay your substances in large or fantastical work,
since if they appear good & extraordinary in large work, they will
show excellently on a common work.
