Plaster

You can mold with it as large a piece as you please. But if you take
your molds from large works & pieces of wood, it
will not release well, unless you boil make your wood
imbibe very hot wax. For the wood absorbs & drinks
& in this way attracts the plaster. You can assume the same
thing for any other large piece of work. But the cure is to
l’ab saturate l’ouvra with very
hot wax the work on which you want to cast your plaster. For,
by this means, it will not drink it up & will release very
neatly.



If the plaster shrinks, it will always make flashing. Find some hard
ones and it put your molds well in the press before
casting.

It is not good when it
shrinks.
