Sand from the mine

It wants to be well reheated for great metals. Some burn it

in the furnace until it is very black and grind it finely on

porphyry. Others burn it with aspalte, but

when it is too burnt, it does not mold so neatly, because it does not

have body and is too lean. You can give it body with tripoli or

burnt felt.
