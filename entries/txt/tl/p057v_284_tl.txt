Sheath maker

Sheath makersuse small, very delicate skins of
lambs and young goats, almost like
parchment and keep them constantly re-moistened in humid
places. When they want to imprint some history, they layer them in
the hollows of their figure, then put over the top fine fatty
earth with which cloths are degreased, having pressed & beaten
it well & rendered it moderately humid and soft. Then they put on
the earth a small even board and put the whole in a
press and let it dry there. After the
earth, only the leather remains neatly imprinted  of
the size of a pea. And then you give the
leather two or three even layers of copperas black and
iron scale, one after the other, like the
tanners do. And this dye, being astringent, makes the
leather shrink & strengthens it and makes it imprint better.
Once dry, one gluescanvas on the back with strong glue. 
In this manner one can promptly imitate big statues &
very delicate medals and paint &
decorate them & are light and portable
& last a long time. That which is imprinted on a relief
is done differently and can be passed over again with a hot
iron.
