Varnish for distemper

You can make marble with distemper of lake or
rose of Ghent &amp; chalk. Once dry, glaze with
lake tempered in wine, for the glue makes it die &amp;
blacken. And all will appear red, but the varnish you will
put here, which will penetrate, will make appear dark &amp; light
that which ought to be thus. The varnish is made thus, mix with clear
Venice turpentine some spike lavender oil
&amp; until all is clear &amp; liquid enough, &amp; it is done
without fire. This one es is for things in
distemper, and the turpentine varnish that you know, for
panels. Pure spike lavender oil varnish is not good for
panels, for spike lavender oil is too penetrating &amp;
makes colors sparkle, unless it was made long ago.
