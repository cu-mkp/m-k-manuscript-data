  Blood of
  
   snakes
  


  If you need to cut some
  
   snake
  
  inside the
  
   mold
  
  to
burn it, cut it far from the entrance of the
  
   mold
  
  lest
  
   blood
  
  remains, for it would
make a crust that afterward would not be taken away by the same
  
   quicksilver
  
  & would remove the impressions from your
  
   mold
  
  .
