Paintbrushes

To make them well, cut the hair from the tail of a
squirrel’s fur, as much in one go as one can hold in a
card folded up like a cannule. And putting it thus into
the said folded card, tap it &amp; shake
it such that the hair comes together &amp; is rendered
the same length. Put one or two bristles of a rat’s
whiskers in the middle, then, grabbing it with the fist &amp;
pinching it well with the thumb &amp; index finger,
thoroughly wet the tip of all this hair in water, then,
moving close to the










light, pull out the hairs which make the tip too long with the
ends of your fingernails, and this until the tip seems good to
you, &amp; until you notice in it the rat hairs
which are entirely black &amp; the hair of the
petit-gris is at the
whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind
b and tighten it very well with a thread in
two places, then cut the excess &amp; fit it in a quill of a
convenient thickness for it, of a duck or a crow for the
small ones. Good paintbrushes are those that, once dipped
in water, do not bulge when you trace on your hand.
