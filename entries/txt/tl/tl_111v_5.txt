Composition of sand

Once everything is reheated as said above, take four 4 full

crucibles of plaster, two 2 of brick,

&amp; one of feather alum. Do not pass through the

sieve to mix may because the

alum would not pass. Mix with your

hands until neither one nor the other, neither white

nor red, can be discerned among the other. If your plaster were not

strong, do not mix in at all so much feather alum, because

it softens the molds. Take heed also that your sand is not hot

(since it has immediately been reheated) C when you

will want to mix it with water, for this les

makes molds too soft &amp; breakable.

You may sometimes diminish the quantity of plaster if you do not

find it strong enough to withstand fire &amp; if it cracks,

&amp; in order that the part of pestled tiles holds up, with

the feather alum, which you can also increase so that

it creates a better bond.
