 Founding of
 
  soft iron
 

  Most
  
   people
  
  consider that
  
   iron
  
  , once melted,
cannot be melted again because they only heat it in
  
   small
forges
  
  , in which it only becomes red-hot.
  
   Alchemists
  
  undertake to melt it mixed with
  
   realgar
  
  or
  
   lead
  
  or
  
   orpiment
  
  . 
But without all that, some have found a manner of
  
   the
  
  melting not only
  
   brittle iron
  
  , such as the kind used
for
  

    iron
   
   pots
  
  , but also
  
   soft iron
  
  such
as
  

    d
   

  that of pigs & ingots, which is the most
difficult kind. And to this effect they make a
  
   furnace
  
  in this
manner which has a width of one
  

    pan
   
   & a half
  
  &
  
   one
   

     pan
    
    & a half
   
   of
  
  a depth of two
  

    pans
   

  . And the
  
   blast-pipe
  
  , which is the barrel
  
   through
  
  marked A through which the
  
   bellowsâ€™ pipes
  
  enter, has
to
  

  be placed in the middle of the height of the
  
   furnace
  
  such
that there is one
  

    pan
   

  of the mouth of the
  
   furnace
  
  above the
  
   blast-pipe
  
  & one
  

    pan
   

  underneath.
 

  Each
  

    pan
   

  of the mouth of the
  
   square furnace
  
  contains
  
   one & a half quintal
  
  , & the
  

    pan
   

  of the
  
   round furnace
  
  holds two
  
   quintals
  
  .
 







  The
  
   miners
  
  , to make the
  
   iron
  
  run, put at the mouth of
the melt, two or three
  

    handfuls
   

  of
  

    wallwort
   

  when they want to make the melt run, and
this renders the
  
   iron
  
  wonderfully ductile and flowing.
 



  It is also necessary that the
  
   blast-pipe
  
  enters through to the
middle of the mouth of the
  
   furnace
  
  , which is a principal part of
the secret because the wind will hit the edge & the wall which makes
up the belly of the
  
   furnace
  
  & by such means, it spreads
equally everywhere & above, like the flame in a
  
   reverberatory
furnace
  
  , & by such means heats much more; for if the wind were
to hit directly from above, the substance which is melted or ready to be
melted, it would cool it down & prevent it from running &
melting. It is also necessary for the
  
   bellows
  
  to be driven by the
leaping & running of
  
   water
  
  as in
  
   forges
  
  , because in
this manner, the
  
   bellows
  
  run with measure & compass & with great
speed, which the strength of
  
   workers
  
  could
  

    f
   

  not
do. Therefore one raises the wall as you see & the
  
   furnace
  
  on the surface of the ground at the edge of which you make a channel as
with other founding, to put the
  
   molds
  
  of that which you want to
cast & to do this, you unstop the opening that you had made at the
bottom of the
  
   furnace
  
  to make the melted substance run. You
will be able to melt two
  
   quintals
  
  of
  
   iron
  
  each time and
to do this, you will choose the
  

    biggest
   
   charcoal
  
  you
can find & put a load of it at the bottom, on the plane and surface
of the
  
   furnace
  
  & with the bottom piling up
  
   as if
  
  to a point, up to the top of the wall
 

  Some make a
  
   mold
  
  of the caliber of the piece, & temper it,
then beat a
  
   soft iron
  
  piece cut to size, & when
this piece is very red, they beat it into the
  
   mold
  
  & round
it off with a
  
   large file
  
  , considering these balls to be
stronger than the melted ones which, being brittle, are more subject to
breaking.
 



  which is usually of a height of
  

    d
   

  three
  

    pans
   


   & will reheat well the
  
  . But first,
it is necessary that you have reheated your
  
   furnace
  

   with
  
  with a little of the
  
   big charcoal
  
  , such that
the bottom is red hot and then you will put there the aforesaid load of
  
   charcoals
  
  in the middle of which you will put your
  
   iron
  
  ,
not all at once but ten or fifteen
  
   lb
  
  each time. And when this
will be swallowed
  
   &
  
  at the bottom of the
  
   furnace
  
  ,
always put in as much again. And add three or four
  
   shovels
  
  of
  
   new charcoal
  
  which should be of the biggest kind and remoistened,
in order that it may have more heat & not be consumed too soon.
And when you see that your
  
   furnace
  
  is full of substance, around
two
  
   quintals
  
  , or less if you do not
  

    of it
   

  have that much, you will
leave the
  
   charcoal
  
  to be consumed by itself. And when the
  
   charcoal
  
  is as it were reduced down to the level of the
  
   furnace
  
  , you will be able to pour into
  
   molds
  
  &
  

    iron
   
   or
   

     metal
    



   shells
  
  , which is even better
because one
  
   iron
  
  attaches to the other. And it is necessary that
the inside of the
  
   mold
  
  be well ashed with
  
   tempered
ashes
  
  , in order that it does not adhere to it.
