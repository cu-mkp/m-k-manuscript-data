Earth for molding

Tannerâ€™s earth, or the one with which

potters make a whitening on pots to make lead run

better on them &amp; to prevent the lead from being absorbed into

them, is very good for molding the hollow forms of things you want make in

relief. It releases better than plaster or sulfur which

become hard once they have set. For the earth being ready, one

ought to beat it hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very

large you can mold it in several parts. If you reheat it, it is

necessary that it be over a closed fire. One finds this earth at

Fosseret &amp; in another place

called Ox.
