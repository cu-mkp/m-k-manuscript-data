#&amp; swellings. It

is necessary that it not be too wet for the aforesaid reasons. Reheat

little by little. And if, after molding it, you leave it to

dry slowly, in some dry place &amp; not over a big fire, it

would be better, for when one exposes it all at once to intense heat, it

warps. I believe that reheating it at the mouth of the oven,

after the bread has been taken out, would be very proper. One

ought not to complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it

withstands as many castings as you wish, because it renders itself as

hard as marble, &amp; you can polish it, &amp; the mold

cannot be spoiled. Once used, pestle &amp; sieve it again, yet

without being scrupulous to render it so fine,

I for having been passed only through a common

sieve, it has more force than and releases better, than

when it is so fine.

Sand from a mine in Thoulouse

The sand from Thoulouse, which is taken, from the

depths of the earth, from the small hill of Puy

David, is excellent in itself, but to make it withstand

several castings, I mix it with pulverized sandiver &amp;

moistened, which hardens it, &amp; takes body &amp; bond with it, &amp;

makes it withstand more than five as many castings as you

wish. Try to moisten the pestled glass and other

e sands with the waters of the aforesaid

salts. It wants to be, like all natural sand, well reheated

before putting it to use. One pulverizes it, because it is in lumps,

then one reheats it in a copper kettle or similar thing,

untill it no longer smokes

It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It is rendered better for

casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used a lot, one

ought to refresh it with new sand.
