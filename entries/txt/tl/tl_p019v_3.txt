Clysters



One used to give them with leather sleeves or bags,
which for the best result <-is-> must be of cat
skin which is more mitten-like than any other. And then one would
start to fold back the sleeve on one side & one would
continue to fold it back & twist it around itself & in that way
the clyster would run gently. But this manner takes longer & is less
convenient than the syringe which has been discovered since,
with which a man alone easily gives a clyster. It is true that
it always causes wind at the end.
