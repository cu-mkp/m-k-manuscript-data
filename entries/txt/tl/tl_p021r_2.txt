Others place two poles fixed well into
the earth such that one is <-equally-> as far from the edge
<-and->of the muzzle of the 
cannon as the other. And underneath they place the above-mentioned
ruler. Then when they want to fire at
night, they push their cannon straight toward the above-mentioned
ruler & make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on the
end of the aforesaid ruler. Next, they measure with a
ruler or similar thing cut to measure, from one pole to the
side of the cannon & if it is too close or too far from it, they
adjust it & do thus from the side of the other pole.
