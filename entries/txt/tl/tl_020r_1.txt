For making millas

It is necessary to have millet pilled to remove the

husks and then you will clean it well. Next one needs to

grind it again quite finely and pass it through a hair sieve

quite finely. This done, it is necessary to mix the flour with

melted fresh butter and milk, and that there be

as much of one as the other, in such a manner that it is very light in color,

like the dough to make fritters. And you will put in egg

yolks according to the quantity of flour, so that it amounts

to two egg yolks for each millas.

Then you will put in some saffron, if you like, to give

them a little color.

Next, you need to have molds, and it is

necessary that they be earthenware, in the fashion of the crown of

a catholic hat, but it is necessary that they be open at both ends. And

then, having made a good fire, you will clean the place in the

hearth where you want to put your

millas, and then you will take your molds and

grease them quite heavily in order that the dough does not stick when it is

cooked. Having done that, you will put your said molds on the

well-cleaned place in the hearth and will put a

little flour at the bottom and fill them with the aforementioned

dough. Next you will cover the said molds with

lids which will be made like the molds, but it is

necessary that they be larger and not be open at the top. Then having

done that, you will put a little hay on the said lids

and plenty of embers, and make a good charcoal fire all around.

That done, you will uncover one of them soon thereafter and see when it

is cooked. It should be hard.
