Enameling a cornaline

Soak some wheat flower in white wine, then
besmear & cover the whole cornaline with it. And bring the
violet kind to heat again, next put it to temper in white wine
for one or two hours, then scratch it & leave
the part you want to keep on it, then lay on some more on top
again.
