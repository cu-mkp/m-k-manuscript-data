Against burns, excellent

Heat linseed oil on a gentle fire without letting

it boil &amp; simmer, but once it is hot, put in a quarter as

much of the newest wax you can. Once melted, let it cool, &amp;

once they begin to curdle, stir continuously with a new

wooden spatula t for as long as it takes

you to say one 9 paternoster, and as you say them,

wash this composition with holy water, stirring all the while.

Having said the s first 9 paternoster, pour out the

first water &amp; put in new one, &amp; wash &amp; stir the

composition for the time it takes you to say 8 paternoster, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, &amp; thus

you will consecutively until add new water, doing the

same as above, until the last &amp; single paternoster of

nine. Then you shall have a soft &amp; white ointment, with which

you shall anoint the burn for the space of 9 days.

But do not apply it any longer than this, for it would cause

a your flesh to grow excessively. You

p shall bandage yourself twice a day,

&amp; each time you shall wash your face with water

&amp; wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing, but as if

pressing with a wet linen cloth, and you shall wipe it similarly

aff with a fine linen cloth, &amp; next put

the ointment, over which you can put ivy leaves.

This causes hair to regrow &amp; leaves no scar. A

gunpowder maker who had almost completely burnt himself

me &amp; showed no sign of the burn, taught me

this.
