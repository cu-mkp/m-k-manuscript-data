Clay earth

This one, moistened & well beaten & kneaded as you know, is
necessary for you to make the contour for containing your
molds. But take heed that it is not too soft, but rather as if
half dry, that <-il->it does
not attach to your hands, because otherwise
it would attach to your work. Always keep it in a humid place,
and make holes in it, and fill them with water to keep it
fresh.



The gray one is best, which does not crack at all.



It is more appropriate than a blade of lead.
