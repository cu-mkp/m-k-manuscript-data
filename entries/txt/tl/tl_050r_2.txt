Molding

If you want to promptly mold something in half relief that

comes to hand, fold some paper in five or six doubles,

&amp; place it on the medal &amp; make sure the

paper is folded on the back of the medal so

that it is well secured. Next, take a stick, broad at one end

&amp; pointed at the other, well softened, and rub well on the

paper, &amp; with the point of the stick retrace

the lines &amp; proceed until you recognize that your imprint is well

done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub oil with a

paintbrush lemp on the

paper imprint and cast in tallow or

wax or sulfur, &amp; the paper, without

burning, will render your portrait neat, which you will afterward be able to

mold in plaster or tripoli, and then in

lead &amp; other metal.

Polished carton of little thickness &amp; a little

moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with

paper glued on the back.
