  black
 


   Iron scale
  
  taken from bars that have been in the fire for a
  
   long time
  
  , & which is thick, is much better
than that
  
   common delicate kind that falls under the
   
    anvil
   

  in the
  
   forge
  
  , because it imitates
  
   niello
  
  . To the said
  
   black
  
  ,
described elsewhere, some add
  

    d
   

  a little
  
   minium
  
  to it.
