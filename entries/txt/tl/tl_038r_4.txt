Amber

The orangeish color that is in transparent amber and in the

other one that has body is not internal, for on the inside it is

whitish. But through age it or wearing it, it acquires this

reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the file or on

the wheel do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But

they only polish it, rubbing it with a willow

stick or other soft wood dipped into water &amp;

dusted with tripoli of Brittany, and it takes a

beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow &amp; you want to intensify

its color, hang it inside a chimney where there is much

soot &amp; smoke, and it will take on a reddish-orange

color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under

dung to turn it green, like bones. Or smoke it

in a closed space, with the smoke of safre or

manganese &amp; other drugs that you know. Or in

urine &amp; distilled vinegar mixed with colors, or in the

vapor of aquafortis boiling in copper, or

aquafortis boiling with silver &amp; sal

ammoniac. &amp; some cut amber in facets on a wheel

of soft wood with putty instead of

emery, &amp; jet also. The salt called by the English de armonic is a mineral salt that resembles marble stone and is a very hard mineral with large pieces, like that of Cardona &amp; Monserrat.

I have experimented by making it boil in lye or corrosive

water, it turns reddish on the surface. And if it is rubbed against

fir &amp; soft wood before it is cooled, it is

easily cut.
