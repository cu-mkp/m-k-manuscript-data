For giving venting to the mold

In addition to your vents, if your <-es-> plant is
very fine, you can pass a thread through the
clay circle, rather than casting with a
needle, & make sure it passes through the plant. And with the
thread burning like the plant, a hole will remain which will
give air & venting, to help clean.
