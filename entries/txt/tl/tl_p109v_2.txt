Killing snakes for molding

Some put a drop of aquafortis in the mouth,
which stuns them well, such that the head & the part behind
seem to be dead but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it
with a needle to fit it to the mold, it moves &
spoils & undoes everything. Therefore, to put them to death entirely, put it
in a bottle of good vinegar & some eau-de-vie. And do thus with lizards & other similar
beasts.



If you want to keep them, you can put them in a pipe full of
earth in a garden outdoors. But your pipe
must be covered with archal wire, for otherwise it would
climb & go up very high.
