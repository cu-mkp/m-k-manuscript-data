 Putting to death the animal for molding
 
  You need to be careful not to wound it in taking it. And, having put
it in a
  

    glass
   
   bottle
  


    d
   



  with
  
   bran
  
  , or in a
  
   barrel
  

   full
  
  half full of
  
   fresh & humid earth
  
  , if you want to store them or keep them a
  
   long time
  
  , give them live
  
   frogs
  
  & not dead ones
to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &
grow thin & have long wrinkled
  

    aulx
   



  skins. Thus the best would be to
mold it as soon as
  
   after
  
  possible
  

    apre
   

  after it has been taken. But before, put it to
death in this way. Place it in a
  
   clean bottle or vessel
  
  so
that it would collect no dust. And put inside such a quantity of
  
   good
vinegar
  
  &
  

    urine
   

  that it can be covered. And shake it
& torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in
  

    an hour or a half
   

  . But if you are in a
hurry
 

  To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the
  
   vinegar
  
  and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
& when piercing it, it would draw back & spoil the mold.
 



    Water
   
   snakes
  
  hardly bite.
 



  to cast, make him take through the mouth some good
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  or else mix a little with the
  
   vinegar
  
  . And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  , one uses
  
   vinegar
  
  and
  

    er
   



    urine
   

  . But for small
ones, only
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  , which is done sooner.
When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it carefully of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the
  
   filth
  
  , or of the
  
   lice
  
  , like
  
   lizards
  
  have, and then arrange it thus.
 

  Now, put enough in a
  
   glass
  
  , & soak & continually keep in it
the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
big.
 

  Take heed, before it dies, to keep the eyes open
  

    es
   



  by blocking the eyelids with a little bit of
  
   wax
  
  or something
else.
