to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau-de-vie or else mix a little with the vinegar. And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of eau-de-vie, one uses
vinegar and <-er-> urine. But for small
ones, only eau-de-vie, which is done sooner.
When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it carefully of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like
lizards have, and then arrange it thus.





Now, put enough in a glass, & soak & continually keep in it
the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
big.





Take heed, before it dies, to keep the eyes open <-es->
by blocking the eyelids with a little bit of wax or something
else.
