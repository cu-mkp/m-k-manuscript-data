One needs to be quite careful about this, & not make it, as some
will, with gold color which is made with the washings of
oil paintbrushes, because verdigris &

good to do it


  
  




with ceruse, & a bit of yellow ocher, &
a little massicot, & make it not very thick in order that it does
not crack.
