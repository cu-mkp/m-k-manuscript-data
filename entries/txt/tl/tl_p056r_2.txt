Varnish for distemper

You can make marble with distemper of lake or
rose of Ghent & chalk. Once dry, glaze with
lake tempered in wine, for the glue makes it die &
blacken. And all will appear red, but the varnish you will
put here, which will penetrate, will make appear dark & light
that which ought to be thus. The varnish is made thus, mix with clear
Venice turpentine some spike lavender oil
<-&-> until all is clear & liquid enough, & it is done
without fire. This one <-es-> is for things in
distemper, and the turpentine varnish that you know, for
panels. Pure spike lavender oil varnish is not good for
panels, for spike lavender oil is too penetrating &
makes colors sparkle, unless it was made long ago.
