Grey guards

Once they are white, one only needs to clean we them

well, then put them in the fire, &amp; make them pass to blue. And one

needs to take good care that they do not pass too far beyond blue, for

neither gold nor silver nor any color would take on it. To do this,

which is called making them pass, one takes

a cauldron full of ashes, which one covers with

thoroughly lit charcoal, &amp; thus one heats them quite strongly for an

hour or two, and when the ashes are very hot,

one pulls the charcoal to one side &amp; one puts the guard where the

charcoal was, &amp; one covers it completely with ashes. And when

the body of the guard, which is the main thing, is completely passed,

one rotates the guard onto the other side, and in this manner, the grey

cannot pass too much, unless some hot charcoal touches it. The

grey can be done well in the ordinary fire in the

fireplace, but there is a danger that it may pass too much &amp;

produce filth, which will prevent it from taking color. Blue is

obtained as soon as the ash has heated the guards a little, but

it is still grey in some places. After blue comes grey.
