Imprimatura

One needs to be quite careful about this, &amp; not make it, as some

will, with gold color which is made with the washings of

oil paintbrushes, because verdigris &amp;

other corrosive colors which are in it will in the end make

the colors die that are meu layered on next. It is

good to do it

with ceruse, &amp; a bit of yellow ocher, &amp;

a little massicot, &amp; make it not very thick in order that it does

not crack.
