White varnish on plaster

Give two or three coats of quite white glue for
painting. Next, varnish with varnish of sandarac, spike
lavender oil, and a little mastic. And in the
evening put it into a vessel, all pestled well together,
without fire, which would turn it yellow. Then with a
paintbrush, it is dry immediately. Pour the oil,
which will have taken the substance.
