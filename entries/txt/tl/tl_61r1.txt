Flesh colors

You need to make two kinds of it, one more red to make the main
layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as around the eyes. And
then on this last flesh color, you will lightly touch the principal lights
with a little lead white. But avoid putting too much of it for
this will make it look like a face of death. The beautiful
Florence lake makes a beautiful <-re-> vivid flesh color
approaching <-[illegible]-> the tint of rose
alexandrine & incarnadine.





Certain colors do not want to be ground, like minium and
massicot. The ashes do not want to be ground at all.
