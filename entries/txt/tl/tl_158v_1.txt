Colors for green leaves

One usually paints them in oil, because distemper

colors have no hold. For marigold flowers, lightly ground

minium for some, &amp; for others which are more yellowish, a bit of

massicot with it. For green, the verdigris has depth &amp;

is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the

verdigris a little yellow ocher &amp; stil de grain

yellow. If the green is dark, put with it charcoal of peach

tree pits, which makes a v greenish black, in the

same way that black of ox foot bone looks bluish. And

thus, by judgment &amp; discretion, put the color on the natural

flower or leaf to see whether it comes close. But layer it

transparently, so as not to cover the lines of the work.
