Powder for hourglasses

It is made very fine &amp; without being subject to rust &amp; by

its weight able to flow; taking i lb of lead, melt it

and skim and purify it from its filth, then pour into it four

â„¥ of finely pulverized common salt, and

take good care that there be neither stones nor earth. And

immediately after you have poured it, mix continuously very well with an

iron until the lead and salt are well

incorporated, and lift it immediately from the fire, stirring

continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on

marble and pass it through a fine sieve. Then

wash it so many times that the water sembl

becomes clear, throwing away that little powder which will swim

on it, renewing the water so many times that it stays entirely

uniform.
