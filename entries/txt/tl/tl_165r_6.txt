Repairing snakes and lizards

You could well make some puncheons according to the form of

their scales, &amp; making some bigger &amp; some smaller, according to

the shape of the neck, the body, &amp; the tail. If there is something

broken, you can graft it on with small pieces points of

iron or steel wire, &amp; glue with fish

glue, &amp; then cover it all with gray or black wax. But it

is necessary to let the glue dry for one day

without touching it.
