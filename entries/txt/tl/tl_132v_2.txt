Crocum ferri

Having d passed it through vinegar &amp;

reddened it in the fire, I had it finely ground on porphyry,

until no roughness was perceived on the fingernail. Then,

I wet it with very good vinegar &amp; 

left it there a two or three days, stirring

it several times each day. Finally, I boiled it

&amp; reddened in the pot &amp;

crocum all together in the four Ã 

vent. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that

can be pulverized very finely between the fingers. I

put some in the sand, a half as much as

feather alum. I tempered the sand quite thinly &amp; molded

out of it a very small female lizard, which molded very neatly &amp;

delicately &amp; very finely. The crocum ferri does not

render the mold harder, but it firms it. And when your

mold is soft &amp; fatty when scraping it with the

fingernail, it is a sign that the crocum is

good, very fine, &amp; well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the

mold, because it is a friend to gold. And I believe that

silver would come out well. And that the mold, through

this means, does not crack. Make it from filings of

needles.

        

I have tried to make it so the molds where it is mixed do not crack

during reheating &amp; thus do not make flashing.

    

        

It is better made with distilled vinegar.

One can put some amongst the molds, where you want to cast

silver, for it firms the molds, and you will find it so,

by scraping a little harder than the other where there is none. It molds

very neatly.

This one is appropriate for all molds &amp; keeps them from

breaking &amp; bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands

several casts. The one of steel fillings &amp; needles is redder

&amp; better.
