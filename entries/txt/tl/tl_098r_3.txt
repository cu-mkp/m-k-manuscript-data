To tin nails well, and other work, they file their
work very neatly. Then to clean it well &amp; rid it of grease, they
make it boil in vinegar, then they wipe it well with a
linen cloth. Next, they heat it &amp; pass some
rosin over the top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
varnish. This done, they melt some pure &amp; fine tin in
their estamiere, which is a little square iron
box. And when the tin is well melted &amp; moderately warm, they
throw in rosin to burn the filth, &amp; then they let the
head of a nail or something similar soak a little, &amp; having
remained there for seven or eight pauses, they take
it out and shake it, hitting the top with an iron to
make the tin that is superfluous fall off, &amp; clean it with a
small stick wrapped in tow. And if it is not well
tinned, you will rub it hot with a piece of rosin &amp; do
as before &amp; let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
which is a sign that the tin is the right temperature. But it
becomes blue if the tin is too hot. Things t
thus tinned are durable &amp; are not undone like tinning done
in leaf, thus at the end of a year, they can be clarified
&amp; renewed by heating &amp; rubbing them.

Leadsmiths say that making a lizard die in the
melted il des tin makes the tinning
become very golden. Or else putting in sal ammoniac.
