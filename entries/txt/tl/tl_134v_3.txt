Secret for soldering gold and silver in

small works

If some piece of small foot does not come out well in gold or

silver, by fault of not having made a gate of

wax underneath, beat some soldering gold very thinly, then cut it in

as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this phlegm

 or white thick which saliva that is found on

the teeth, &amp; with the point of a burin,

apply it to the place you want to solder, &amp; place there a

little spangle of gold; &amp; next, with a little fat

earth wetted with saliva, make a small layer on the

opposite side to hold the solder better. Next, pulverize on top a

little borax &amp; put in the fire. Boiled water of

quince seed &amp; others also.
