They have very thin wings, &amp; if they are large &amp; dry and
their wings extended, one would need a very large mold &amp; it
would not be certain that the metal would run sufficiently. Thus,
when you want to mold them, choose the medium-sized ones &amp; make the
pose qu so that they have their wings half folded. Because in
this way they will come out better, but support the side of the wings
with wax, as you know, to feed the cast well.
