Mulled and sugared wine

The English, when they feel a cold coming on, mull wine in this

manner. They heat it in a large tin pot until

it boils, and when it is boiling up, they remove it from

light it with burning paper to know if it is hot

enough. Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one

vessel into another, as one who wants to beat eau

panée, and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a

burning paper what is falling from one vessel into the

other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the

wine is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few

cloves &amp; a sufficient quantity of sugar. And

they dri drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.

The common English put sugar in wine to affect

    for themselves the sweet new wine which they cannot have because,

owing to the long sea crossing, the wine has lost its

sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.
