  Plaster
 
 for molding
 
  When it is long to set & dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty
& humid, which is what makes it contract in fire & crack,
causing flashing. That which is drawn from
  
   lean soil
  
  is the best.
  
   Molds
  
  of
  
   fatty plaster
  
  ought not to be kept for a
  
   long
time
  
  , for they act like
  
   fatty earth
  
  , which when drying by itself,
cracks.
  
   It is best to reheat them
   

   soon after they are made, &
to cast.
   
    Good plaster
   
   keeps
   

   a
   
    long time
   
   in
   


    molds
   
   .
  


  It needs to be well
  
   oiled
  
  , for it is more difficult to separate
the two halves of the
  
   molds
  
  than when it is mixed.
