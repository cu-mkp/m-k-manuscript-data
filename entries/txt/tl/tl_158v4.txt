Gate

<-Even though-> If the medal is very thick, for
this reason do not give it as thick a gate. It suffices for the gate
to have half of its thickness. But if it is thin,
give it a gate of its thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the gate
where typically the material becomes porous.





Never forget to oil the wax gate when you mold plants
or flowers, otherwise it breaks & cannot be taken out.
