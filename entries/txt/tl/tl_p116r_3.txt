 Casting for
 
  gold
 
 and
 
  silver
 

  It is necessary that the
  
   molds
  
  be fiery red & ablaze when
you cast in
  
   gold
  
  &
  
   silver
  
  , or you burn flowers and
bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the
molded thing because the substance flows better when at ease and
without shaking the
  
   mold
  
  , & does not become as porous.
