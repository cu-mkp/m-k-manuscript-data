For varnishing

Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because it
is fatty & viscous & it is not absorbed in the wood like that
of spike lavender & sandarac. Also, that of spike
lavender does not require any glue on iron &
similar things that do not absorb. But on wood & on colors
which <-have-> do not have gum or 
distemper glue, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
hide glue & to let it dry & to
varnish.
