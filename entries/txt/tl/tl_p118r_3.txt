 For
 
  grottos
 

  The
  
   old
   
    vine
   
   stocks
  



   Stones made from water
  
  called
  


     stuf
    


  ,
  


   charcoal
  
  , the
  
   compound of tin & fine latten
  
  ,
  
   paper
   
    pestled
   

  & mixed with
  

    pestled
   
   glass
  
  ,
  
   cork
  
  ,
  
   heated parchment
  
  ,
  
   white coral
  
  are appropriate for making
  
   grottos
  
  . But
  
   fantastical pieces of wood
  
  which are
found in the
  
   forests
  
  , &
  

    mushrooms
   

  , and
  


     potirons
    

   of trees
  
  , once dry, are better than
any other because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
  
   looking-glass tin
  
  , which has a shiny luster. One finely
  
   pestles
  
  diverse sorts of
  
   marcasites
  
  which one washes to cleanse them of
  
   earth
  
  , & one sprinkles the work with it, which is very
beautiful. If there is no fountain in the
  
   grotto
  
  , one
  
   glues
  
  all
  

    al
   

  of this with
  
   strong glue
  
  ,
  
   which
  
  and it is soon done.
  
   Take
specimens of all kinds of
   
    minerals
   
   . The
   
    sulfurous marcasites
   
   ,
which do not have a grain but are uniform like
   
    looking-glass tin
   
   ,
are very beautiful.
  



   Rosette
  
  is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
lumps which are pulverized under the
  
   hammer
  
  , which are very
beautiful pulverized on
  
   grottos
  
  .
