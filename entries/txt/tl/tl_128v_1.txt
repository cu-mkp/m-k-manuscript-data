Whitening of cast silver



Because one commonly casts in base silver, &amp; especially the
Germans, and that such an alloy readily makes a film
or crust, which is contrary to our some
goldsmiths from France are usually quick
to whiten their works, especially rough ones, because they only
use common bullitoyre, which is tartar &amp;
common salt, nearly as much of one as the other. But I
have seen an excellent German working thus. Having in my
presence cast a little lizard with an alloy of
teston, he made a greyish noi crust.
And to clean it from it, he boiled it in the above-mentioned
bullitoyre of tartar &amp; pulverized
common salt and mixed with common water, in the
fire of his forge. Once taken out, he brushed it. And
because it was not as clean of this crust as he fancied, he burned some
tartar in some paper until it was
black &amp; no longer smoked. Then, he wetted the aforesaid tartar
d with the water of bullitoyre,
composed of salt &amp; tartar, &amp; covered all his
lizard with it. Then, he put it between the live of
charcoals of his forge &amp; blew a little. When the
lizard was red, he took it out, let it cool, then reheated it
in the bullitoyre. Next, he brushed it in
clear water.

Note that the bullitoyre for silver is never good
in a crucible because the water, taking the form of the
f tartar, evaporates. But the vessel
for boiling, being of copper, is excellent for the whitening of
silver &amp; for the mixture which colors gold.




He took heed not to let his water of tartar boil so much that it
would have poured out on top, because then its strength goes away. Therefore, when this first fury of boiling comes, remove it from the fire &amp; put it
back. He held as a secret this burned tartar put on top for
base silver.
