Sand, slate, and burned earth

Thoroughly burnt sand loses its bond. Slate is reheated &amp; molds
neatly. Next, it is true that it often becomes porous, as burned
earth also does, as fatty sand also does.



I find that one ought not to knock on very finely ground sands, for it
shakes them loose &amp; make prevents them from releasing
neatly. But one ought to press hard and moisten them sufficiently.
