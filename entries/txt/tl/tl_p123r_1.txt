Note that you need
to lute well your crucible,
in order that the substances
do not take air, for
they are exhaled.



  
Lute well your crucible,
in order that it does not break.
For if it breaks, the
substances evaporate
& the fume of it is
dangerous. If within xii
hours it is not melted
and mixed, it will not be
well made.




Goldsmiths who have knowledge of this substance sell a
denier of it for five sous to other
goldsmiths, & especially to those who work in plate
and large wares, for at the end of their works, they can solder
over the first solder by means of this mixture. In general, all
those who want to mold & cast something delicate. This material
should not be divulged, lest it be abused.



The grain is like broken steel.

    

Take these substances, of the best kind you can find. Weigh them as
said above, and pestle them separately, keeping your
face covered, over the nose & the
mouth, from the eyes down, to avoid the exhalations of
arsenic, sublimate, and orpiment. Mix them well, all
together, then put them in a good crucible that is so large
that the substances can have the fourth or fifth part as empty space.
Cover the crucible with a good tile, adapted in a
circle precisely on its opening. And having bound it from top to bottom
and on the sides with iron wire quite strongly, lute it
with earth mixed with dung or founder's earth that artillery
founders use. And in this, be careful & diligent, & do
not forget to mix in pestled glass throughout the lute to
fortify your crucible in such a manner that it takes no air, for the
substance would be worth little, because the <-4->
five last ingredients would be exhaled.









Your lute being dry, put, in the early
morning, your crucible in a four à
vent, & at the beginning, give slow fire, as much for
reheating your crucible as for gently letting the fury of the
saltpeter pass. Then, invigorate little by little & with
judgment the fire. And <-there-> leave in the full vigor of the fire your
substances for xii hours or a natural
day. Make each time a good quantity of this substance, so as not to
do it often, because the fumes, which are dangerous, could
hurt you. And before working at it, take in the
morning good buttered toast, and hold the
said butter, or zedoary, or gold coins, in
your mouth, and <-ada-> cover your
face with a cloth from the eyes down. From
this mass, the crust will serve you <-make run-> to
clear <-the great works d-> the silver from
the metallic mass <-like snakes & similar
things-> when it starts to melt. <-But-> And
then the grain that will be at the bottom of the
crucible should be put aside for <-principally delicate
flowers and herbs-> putting a little in the melted
silver when you want to cast it <-However it is necessary
to always put a little of this grain in the silver when <-you
want to cast-> it is well melted and when you are ready to
cast->. Thus, do as you make fine tin on copper,
& for looking-glass tin on lead and on tin.
And just as looking-glass tin sours lead and tin
too much if you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain
composed of the aforesaid substances would sour your silver
if <-l-> you were to put in too much and obscure it.
This aforesaid composition will suffice you for a long time, when
it has been for a whole day on a <-gentle->
gentle fire at the beginning & invigorated degree by degree until
the end. Then, having given it one load of charcoal, let it consume it
by itself, & let your crucible cool. Next, break it. You
will find two hard slabs & cakes in the
crucible. The upper one is as if petrified <-Once->,
composed of salts, sublimated & mixed together. The lower one
is metallic, composed of filings, æs
ustum & antimony, having the grain very small.
Pulverize the upper cake, made from salts, &
put some to clear, & clean the silver, and the metallic
grain will serve you to put in the melted metal.



Charcoal fire




Or else after you have had your drugs pestled by some rustic. And
having put them in your crucible, & the latter luted &

dry as said & placed into the furnace, have the fire
managed by a shop boy familiar with charcoal.




One sells well to silversmiths this metallic mass to
soften their solder, because when melting, latten exhales.
And with a little of this substance, they solder over the other
solder.
