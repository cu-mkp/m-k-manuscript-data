Sand

Grindings are very good for casting in
copper, but one ought not to take those of
cutlers, because it is only sludge, but rather those
of those who grind mold large shears.

Pierres de filieres, with which those who sharpen, mold very neatly, once scraped, for lead. It is
commonly slate-colored. One frequently brings them to
Toulouse from around Carcassonne .
