Gold cast very thinly

When goldsmiths have something to solder promptly

and do not have leisure to forge it, they melt some

gold and then throw it on a cloth or other

things that withstand the fire, and they flatten it immediately

with a hammer or similar thing. And it ends up very thin &amp;

even receives the impression of the cloth.

Fine gold, not alloyed, can be cast in medals,

but not in plants &amp; lizards &amp; very fine things if it

is not alloyed.

A pansy anointed with wheat oil can be cast

in alloyed gold.

And other thin leaves, but only if the branch is not too big and

the leaves, separately cast, can be soldered.
