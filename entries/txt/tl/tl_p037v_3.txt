Yellow Amber



It is cut with a file, then one passes a certain pulverized
salt over it, which an Englishman called
desramonet. But I suppose that this was pulverized
pumice stone, for it had the harshness of ar√®ne. And with a
taut cord, he polished his amber, then passed
tripoli from Bretagne on it with the
finger, others with a piece of leather
or a cane. Amber loses its color if an unhealthy person
wears it, & becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be
soaked for one night in urine, then boiled a
little in it.
