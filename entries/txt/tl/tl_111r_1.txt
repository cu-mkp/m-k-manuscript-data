Reheating molds

The frames readily dry out &amp; do not reheat. For

reheating is actually for the second time to redden &amp;

inflame the molds in the fire, and drying out is to let the

molds dry themselves or to make their dampness evaporate by

placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one.

Noyau molds readily reheat &amp; frame molds

dry out.
