Plaster

When you v mold something to cast wax in it, you

mold in plaster alone, reheated after being pulverized.

For, once reheated in stone, the outside is cooked &amp; the

inside stays almost raw. Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but the one

that, being tempered, is white &amp; sets very

quickly, is good. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm &amp; hard

after having set, but its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the

nature of each. If you You will never mold very neatly if

not you do not temper, very thin &amp;

liquid, your plaster or your sand of noyau. Temper it

immediately quickly after it has been reheated.

If you mold with plaster crud alone, reheat it

nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first

mold. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready,

soak it for a long time in water. And if it does not want to

release, soak it in hot water, for cold water hardens it.

And hot water softens it further. Cold water does not

penetrate it like it does with the mixed one, because it is harder &amp;

the mixed one is more spongy. 

        

With this plaster,

thus reheated as powder,

one can cast medals of it

that do not fear the

rain, especially if they are

varnished. One can find these in

Germany,

on the houses. But take heed that the water be

very hot, &amp; if it is boiling, there is no danger. All

plaster molds, alone or mixed, release in it.
