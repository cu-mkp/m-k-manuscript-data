Glassworker



Some do not apply gris d’escaille to the glass
for painting on glass, but trace on the clean
glass with noir à huile. But it is very necessary that the
wood be rid of grease, for if it has
grease, however little, the color will not take on it at all. And likewise, if the
glassworker who is working has a stench from his
nose or his mouth, <-the-> & he
breathes on the glass, the color will not take on it.
Those who discovered the invention of working in small works of soft
enamels use only esmail d’azur, which is blue,
& esmail colombin, which is the color of purple,
which they soften with rocaille or leaded glass.
As for the yellow, they make it from silver, the red from
sanguine, as is said elsewhere, the black & gray &
shadows with noir d’escaille, either strong or weak,
the flesh color with clear sanguine. The green is made first
from yellow, then on top they coat esmail d’azur, either
strong or weak, according to whether they want to make it bright or
dark.
