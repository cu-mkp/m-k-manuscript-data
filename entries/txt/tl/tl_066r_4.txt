Colors in oil that are imbibed

        

It is best that colors in oil are imbibed, that is to say

they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if

in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the

oil has remained in that part, which would make the colors die.

The varnish mends all this &amp; unites &amp; renders it similar

in one place as in another. | It is necessary that gold color be laid down thick, for if it were clear, it

would be imbibed &amp; would run.
