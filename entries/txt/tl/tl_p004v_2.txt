Black varnish without fire, without disassembling the
harnesses or removing the bands from
trunks

Take varnish of spike lavender oil & mix in
soot black or lampblack, & without fire it will mix in
by itself. Varnish with a brush & it will soon be
dry. Turpentine varnish will be quite good, but it does not dry
as soon.
