 Animals dried in the
 
  oven
 
 for
 
  a long
time
 

  Plant them on a
  
   slab of
   
    earth
   

  , arranging them with
  
   points of
   
    iron
   
   wire
  
  , as if you wanted to mold them, and
  
   they
  
  dry them in an
  
   oven
  

   after the
   
    bread
   
   has been taken out
  
  . And they always remain thus, as much for
  
   snakes
  
  , as
  
   birds
  
  and other things. But it is
necessary that they be dried promptly.
 

  Note that one needs to give them their shape & put them in the
  
   sand
  
  ,
as with flowers, & promptly dry them in the
  
   oven
  
  , which is
  
   hot enough, like when one takes out the
   
    bread
   

  . And it
should stay there
  

    a day & a night
   

  in order that
it is
  

    chau
   

  dry, for otherwise it would be
  
   smelly
  
  . However, take heed that the
  
   oven
  
  not be too
harsh, but rather
  
   like the heat of the
   
    sun in
    
     June
    


  , otherwise the animals cook. Once dry, do not
wet them, but clean them with a
  
   paintbrush
  
  or clean them
with a
  
   brush
  
  .
