Softening

To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but

rather layer them twice, if it is not azur dâ€™esmail.

All colors that have no body in oil have none in

distemper, and but in distemper they sink to

the bottom. Distemper colors want to be fatty, which is

recognized when they take hold on the palette once tempered in

oil.
