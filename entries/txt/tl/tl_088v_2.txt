Mineral sand

It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it

must be in one piece &amp; as if taken from a quarry or

rock formation, &amp; the deeper one takes it from, the

better. The signs of its goodness are that it is thus amassed, and that

when removing itself in the form of rock, it comes out in lumps &amp;

qu bricks, which demonstrate its bond &amp; that it

is not too lean.

However, it should break apart between your

hands &amp; have very small

men &amp; delicate grains &amp; of the same nature.

If it is not delicate enough, you can pass &amp; grind it finely, either

through water or through a sieve &amp; when

it or on the porphyry, &amp; in this way, from

sil lean they become fatty &amp; well bound. You

can mold with it in sa frame or

en noyau without cloth waste, &amp; try it with

lead, for if with this it does not become porous &amp; casts

neatly, it will also behave well with copper. Some say that the

fatty sands do not want the metal to be cast too hot.

Artisans who work in large works &amp;, who for profit, do not

need to grind &amp; seek the curiosities of artificial sands,

benefit more from seeking some that is ready-made by nature, which has the

finest grain possible, &amp; for small works, they only pass it

through a sieve. But those who work in small works, finely

grind it &amp; grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of

it.

Orber√© grain makes a tawny powder, very

delicate &amp; very soft, which, once mixed, could mix mold

very neatly. Try wheat flour burned over a closed

fire.
