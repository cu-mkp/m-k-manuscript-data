  Making the cast, reheating the
  
   molds
  
  , &c
 


 Note about everything
 

 above
 








  if you want, which will be enough,
  

  or else on the two halves.
  

  But because one needs
 



  If your
  
   snake
  
  has been without eating for a
  
   long time
  
  , it
            happens that, when you want to put it to death in
  

    urine
   

  &
  
   vinegar
  
  , it fills with a lot of
  
   water
  
  & swells, and
            next it dries out as you fix & arrange it on the
  
   clay
  

   cake
  
  , and next it happens that when you have cast your
  

    mold
   




   tempered sand
  
  on it, & it has set, it
            ends up coming out such that between the
  
   snake
  
  and animal there
            is a
  
   line
  
  of distance
  

    D
   

  , in which enters
            the second batch of cast
  
   tempered sand
  


    M
   

  . Avoid this,
            therefore, if you can. But if this cannot be, do not let this prevent
            your second cast, for the
  
   sand
  
  which will enter in this void will be so
            weak that it will easily be removed with a
  
   small point
  
  &
            will not have set with the first hardened one.
 

  Note that one needs more
  
   feather alum
  
  for
  
   molds
  
  that should be reheated, like those for
  
   gold
  
  &
  
   silver
  
  & things that one needs to burn inside than for those which release well & that are only for casting
  
   lead
  
  &
  
   tin
  
  . However, do not put too much in either one.
