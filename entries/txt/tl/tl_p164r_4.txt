Blowing



When you melt silver & gold, do not blow strongly
& with violence, because with the charcoal
consolidating, the crucible would lower &
l'arg could fall over. But when your mold is
ready, at that moment, blow strongly to heat well the silver or
gold. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with
small bellows, especially gold, for this removes their
fumes & softens them.
