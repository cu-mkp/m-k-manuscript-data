Sand of crocum



One can use the mixture of crocum ferri in
molds for silver as well as for gold, for it
firms them & keeps them from cracking & making flashing. And I
believe that for flat things it would withstand well
de several casts, which, however, for gold &
silver is hardly practiced.





Try, for lead & tin, crocum.
