Rouge clair 

enamel

Fine gold is opposed to it, for  on it, it

remains yellowish. But alloyed gold is more appropriate for it,

such as that of Ã©cu &amp; pistolet. If

Gold f is not put back on the fire, with its

own pale color, renders the enamel a dead color.

Ma And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back

on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the enamels

beautiful. Otherwise, they are matte.

There is rouge clair which, once it is used with the

arene, loses its beauty.

Some can be found that have grains of gold inside, and it is

also the opinion of good goldsmiths that the good one is made

with gold.
