Flies

        

They mold better on a single leaf than n on a bouquet

or a flower or the branch of a plant, because the single leaf molds in

two halves, which, once reheated, can open and clean well, &amp; the cast is made

better. Take heed when taking the fly to not break the legs &amp; to not

let it dry too much, for then the legs

        

fall

off. And if this happens to you, glue with fish

glue the same legs and with wax,

or fashion some out of swine bristle or

spinet string. Fix the leaf

on the clay slab with two

    

points, and the

fly with one point in the middle of the body, &amp;

the legs with some wax.
