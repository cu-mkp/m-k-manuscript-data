 Shadows
 
  The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear &
thoroughly softened & then the last ones very dark to give relief
well.
  

  The
  
   Italians
  
  commonly make three shadows, the first one,
of light, very clear, the second one darker & the third ones quite
strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from
the darkest to the clearest.
 

  The
  
   varnish
  
  is more beautiful on the panel when the color has
imbibed well.
