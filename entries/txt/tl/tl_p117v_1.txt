For making the ashes of flowers and plants leave
molds

Some <-meslen-> put quicksilver inside it. But, if it is
a small work or fine & delicate foliage that only has
<-p-> a slender exit, they make two errors: the first, that
quicksilver by its heaviness can break <-f-> some delicate
feature inside when shaken, the other, that some grains will always
linger inside that will make metals sour & hinder the
perfection of the cast. It is true that if it is to empty the
mold of some animal which is thickish & which has big conduits
& passages by which the quicksilver can easily exit, like a
bird or a snake, one can indeed put in it some
quicksilver <-pou-> to break by shaking the
calcined bones of the animal, because the said â˜¿ will
come out & not remain.



The asparagus stalk is so hard that most often it remains as
charcoal. Because of this, dry it out beforehand, or wet it with
oil of sulfur & turpentine, or cast separately the little
branches & solder them onto a thick stalk drawn through the
wire drawing plate.



If the burnt thing has left some filth or ash, let it cool
a little, & with an iron wire wrapped in
cotton that can bend according to the cavities that you have
to search out, clean & blow out this defect, or with a soft
brush or a cut paintbrush.
