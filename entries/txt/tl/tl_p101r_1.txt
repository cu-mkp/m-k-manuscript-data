Topaz

The same dose is observed for all gemstones, namely
one weight of calcined pebbles on three of
minium, pestling all separately in a
copper mortar for emerald & in an
iron mortar for making topaz or amber
color, with pestles identical to the mortars. The
emerald & the topaz are of the same heat, & for an
hour & a half on the fire, for they could burn.
The ruby en wants more time & more fire
& colored with gold leaf. I believe that pumice stone
or firestone for the ruby would be better. See the
enamels. Try also mixing, in place of pebbles, pieces of
colored glass or enamels. If the mass is not colored
enough, pestle it more in the iron mortar.





Slightly burnt tartar mixed among this makes beautiful yellow,
but one hardly needs any. The arene also makes it
more yellow.
