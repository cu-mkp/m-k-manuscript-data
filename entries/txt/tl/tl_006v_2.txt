Etch with aquafortis on iron or copper

whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next clean it up with a

burin or chisel. Then pour soft tin

which has not been used onto polished marble &amp; with a 

wooden board, flatten it quite thin. Or else cast

it in tablet form like lead, or put it through a

roller press. Next lay your tin plate over the etched thing,

&amp; over the tin plate put a piece of felt and

strike on top with a hammer. Then gild it in this way.
