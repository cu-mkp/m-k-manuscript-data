For the workshop



It can be gathered from the words of Herodotus that the
navigation of the Portuguese was not newly invented by them, as
they brag. At the beginning of the first book entitled Clio, he
says that the Phoenicians would come from the Red Sea
by continuous navigation to the coast of Greece, mainly to
Argos, to which they would carry merchandise from
Egypt & from Assyria, which they usually sold out
of within 6 days.




Navigation,
trade




Herodotus, on the first page of Clio, says that the
Greeks were on a long ship on the coast of Colchis
& to the river Phasis, whence they carried off
Medea.


Galleys





Herodotus, on the third page, says that Gyges
presented to the temple of Delphi
pateras aureas sex pondo 30
talentorum.




Gold vases




Herodotus. Halyattes, the father of Croesus,
pateram ex ferro compactilem
apud Delphos dedicavit spectatu dignam inter omnia qu√¶ sunt Delphis donaria, opus Glauci Chii qui solus omnium
compactionem ferri excogitavit. Compactile
ferrum, which is made by assembly
& things joined.



Iron vase
joined and soldered

As small peddlers lay open small wares in order to buy
richer ones & to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to learn,
am exposing what little is in my workshop to <-have
in-> receive, through a common commerce of letters, much rarer
secrets from my benevolent readers.
