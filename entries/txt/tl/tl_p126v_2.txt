Plaster

You can mold with it as large a piece as you please. But if you take
your molds from large works & pieces of wood, it
will not release well unless you <-boil-> make your wood
imbibe very hot wax. For the wood absorbs & drinks
& in this way attracts the plaster. You can assume the same
thing for any other large piece of work. But the cure is to
<-l'ab-> saturate <-l'ouvra-> with very
hot wax the work on which you want to cast your plaster. For
by this means, it will not drink it up & will release very
neatly.



If the plaster shrinks, it will always make flashing. Seek the hard
kind and <-it-> put your molds well in the press before
casting.

It is not good when it
shrinks.
