Casting gold and silver

It is necessary that the sand be from something very dry & arid
& reheated well in the frame, because, if it were humid,
like founders' sand, the gold and silver
would spatter, & cause damage. It is also necessary for the
earth to drink the metal, for cast gold or
silver is becomes very spongy. That is why it must be
beaten again, otherwise it is frangible, as one sees in spoon
handles.
