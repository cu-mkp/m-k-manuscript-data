Those who sell velvet &amp; es other

stuffs by retail do not make double-entry books because selling by

retail &amp; in detail it would be too much effort for them. They have

only their sales book &amp; their account book. But those who sell in

bulk &amp; those who traffic in pastel woad have

double-entry books.
