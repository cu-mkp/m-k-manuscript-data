   Or mat
  


  It is made with
  
   massicot
  
  ,
  
   minium
  
  ,
  

    ocre de ru
   

  , 
&
  
   yellow ocher
  
  , in order that the composition
resembles
  
   gold
  
  . Gild
  
   the day after
  

   one
   
    jo
   

  it is laid down if you
  
   in the
  
  make the
seat for the color in the
  
   evening
  
  .
 



  After having gilded,
  

  let it dry
  

  & rest one
  



    day
   

  , next rub the gilding
  

  with a
  
   feather
  
  &
  

    cotton
   

  in order
  

  that no protrusions remain, then varnish with
  

    Flanders
   


   varnish
  
  , which you make mixed with a little
  
   eau-de-vie
  
  ,
  

  to render it desiccative.
 



  The
  
   varnish
  
  will be dry in an
  

    hour
   

  . It
will increase the color of gold. And this
  

    or mat
   

  holds
  
   in the rain
  
  , even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried
for eight or ten
  

    days
   

  .
 

  Gold color that is
  

  made of different
  

  colors cleaned
  

  from
  
   paintbrushes for
   


    oil
   

  is not so good, & with
  
   time
  
  ,
  

  tarnishes the gold because of the
  
   verdigris
  
  . One
  

  must not touch with a
  
   finger
  
  the layer made for
the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The
  

    or
moulu
   

  is spoiled
  

  if
  
   water
  
  touches it, but the
  

    or
mat
   

  holds well
  
   in the rain
  
  & in
  
   water
  
  .
One must not burnish it, because the
  
   tooth
  
  would remove it.
  

  Gather the protrusions & small
  

  flakes that the
  

    cotton
   

  makes lift off when the
  
   gold
  
  is
dry & you clean it, for an
  
   ounce
  
  is still
  
   gold
  
  . In
  
   Flanders
  
  ,
  

  women
  
   make
  

   gild
  
  .
  

  It is more beautiful when it is
  

  a little thick, but in
  
   France
  


  they beat it too delicately.
 



  Breathe on the gold color, and if it fogs up, it is dry enough,
but if it does not receive the vapor of the breath, it is not
enough.
 

  One ought not to gild with
  

    or mat
   

  after
  
   with
  
  having
  
   gilded
  
  . But wait
  
   one day or one night
  
  ,
  
   But
take heed not to
  
  and when it is as if dry, it grips the
  
   gold
  
  . Next, one varnishes.
 



  When gold color starts to grip, it is a sign that in ten or twelve
  

    hours
   

  it will be dry & appropriate for
  
   gilding
  
  .
