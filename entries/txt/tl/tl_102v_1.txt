Painting on crystal or glass

They paint in oil without lines, except for the faces where

they trace the nose &amp; the mouth with black in small work, then they

make strokes &amp; highlights in white, next they coat all with

flesh color. And as for the ground, they make it with azur d’Acre 

for more beauty, or with lake for a quickly-done red, 

or with dragon’s blood for the most beauty. But

one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even &amp; of

one color, &amp; thus for other colors. Next, they put underneath it a

foil backing for topaz, or one of gold or

silver.
