 Very light and hollow work of
 
  gold
 

  Cast a
  
   lizard
  
  or any medal you like in
  
   base silver
  
  ,
like
  
   billon
  
  . Next,
  
   gild
  
  it lightly. And once the first
  
   gilding
  
  is done & dried by fire, brighten, rub with a
  
   scratch-brush
  
  , & make another layer of light
  
   gilding
  
  like the first time, & do thus three or four times or more,
according to the thickness you want to give. And then, having made a
small hole in the least visible place, put your work into
  
   good
aquafortis
  
  , which penetrating to the
  
   silver
  
  through the hole
will eat it all away without damaging the
  
   gold
  
  , so that you will
have a
  
   lizard
  
  hollow to its nails, or any other work, so light
that by blowing you will agitate it. But take heed not to make the layer
of
  
   amalgamated gold
  
  all at once, or
  

  of hardly any thickness each
time, because that would block the small features, but proceeding
therein as said, lightly & several times,
  
   and cleaning
well
  
  , you will do well.
 

  In order for the
  
   aquafortis
  
  to eat away better, it is necessary
to
  
   cast
  
  cast in
  
   base silver
  
  .
