  Earth for casting, for
  
   founders
  


  It renders itself fatty once beaten and also mixed with
  

    horse
   
   dung
  
  .
  

    Potter
   
   â€™s earth
  
  would be
too fatty and would crack & would not hold in the fire, but one needs
to mix it with
  
   half as much
  

   sand
  
  and a
  
   quarter
  
  or a
  
   fifth
  
  of
  


     horse
    

   dung
  
  . And leave
it to dry, then turn it to powder, then
  
   sift
  
  it to render it fine &
purged of gravel, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The
  
   dung
  
  renders the
  
   earth
  
  more amiable & tractable, but it
is necessary that it be well free of
  
   straw
  
  & other things.
And when the
  
   earth
  
  is very fatty, one needs to give it more
  
   sand
  
  & more
  
   dung
  
  .
  

  But one does find
  
   fatty earths
  
  ,
in and of themselves mixed with
  
   sand
  
  . If they are not, do it by artifice.
One always needs to reheat the
  
   earths
  
  before casting.
