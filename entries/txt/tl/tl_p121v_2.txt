Silver for casting

It is not fine silver but alloyed, & which does not
become perfectly white on the fire because they put it to whiten after the
fusion to also clean it of the solder or of this. When
you need to attach some leg animal against another or to
repair, it is commonly teston silver. And all
alloyed silver, as long as it is sweet, is good.

Before starting to cast in silver, one needs to
have earth of which which withstands the fire, like
the sandy earth of qu mixed with cloth
waste which founders use to cast their cannons, or any
good lute which withstands the fire, in order to surround your
molds & fortify them, for they must be all red. One
needs to also bind them with iron wire.

That before casting l'ar reheating the molds, you
have the mixture one needs to make the silver run.

If the goldsmiths knew knew the substance to make
silver run in their works, they would buy much of it. Some buy it five
sous for a denier.



I have used silver from the Capital



Before binding luting & strengthening your molds
for gold & silver with the aforesaid earth, one
needs for the cast to be made & the vents, & the molds
to have been reheated of very red to burn the animals,
flowers, and plants that are inside, & to clean them well of the
ashes. Once quite clean & prepared, lute them & bind them
with iron wire, & reheat them again until they will
be quite red.
