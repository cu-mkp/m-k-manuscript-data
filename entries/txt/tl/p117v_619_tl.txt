For making the ashes of flowers and plants leave
molds

Some mix put quicksilver inside it. But, if it is
a little work, or fine & delicate foliage, that only has
p a slender exit, they make two errors: the first, that
quicksilver by its heaviness can break f some delicate
feature inside when shaken, the other, that some grains will always
linger inside that will make metals sour & hinder the
perfection of the cast. It is true that if it is to empty the
mold of some animal which is thickish & which has big conduits
& passages by which the quicksilver can easily exit, like a
bird or a serpent, one can indeed put in it some
quicksilverpou to break by shaking the
calcined bones of the animal, because the aforesaid ☿ will
come out & not remain at all.


The asparagus stalk is so hard that most often it remains as
charcoal. Because of this, dry it out beforehand, or wet it with
oil of sulfur & turpentine, or cast separately the little
branches & solder them onto a thick stalk drawn through the
wire drawing plate.


If the burnt thing has left some filth or ash, let it cool
a little, & with an iron wire wrapped in
cotton that can bend according to the cavities that you have
to search out, clean & blow out this defect, or with a soft
brush or a clipped paintbrush.
