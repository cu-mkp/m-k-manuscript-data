Birds

Which have been fed by the rod do not whistle among the

company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them to whistle well, one needs to take them from the nest before they can

see &amp; cover them with down or a hare skin. Thus,

having not seen their father and known his voice, they better learn the whistle

that one teaches them.
