For coloring stamped trunks

The stamping of sheets of copper or latten is made on engraved & carved
service tree wood, if one wants to spend less. And next, the stamped object is
colored with the aforesaid colors of lake, verdet,
azur d'esmail, & tempered in turpentine varnish.
But in the place you want to azure, lay down fer
blanc, which is more appropriate for an azure
background.
