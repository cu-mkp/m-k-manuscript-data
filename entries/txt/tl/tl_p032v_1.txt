  They make two kinds of them in
  
   Toulouse
  
  , one to hang on the
  
   partition walls of rooms
  
  , which they weave almost as fine as
the
  
   straw
  


    p
   

  hats worn by
  
   villagers
  
  . And
they make them in long bands, some the
  
   width of ten
   

     b
    


    straws
   

  , others of thirteen. And they
work on them mainly
  

    in summer
   

  . And
  

    in
winter
   

  , when they put it to use, they sew it. But beforehand,
they put it in
  
   dye
  
  and commonly make it in three colors, green,
red, and sometimes violet. The green one is made in a single
  

    pastel woad
   
   dye
  
  , because green being made from yellow and blue, the
  

    pastel woad
   

  discharging itself onto the
  
   straw
  
  ,
which shows its dark yellow, one obtains bright green. For the red, they
use
  
   alum
  
  and
  

    brazilwood
   

  . For the violet, they use
  

    pastel woad
   

  & a little
  
   copperas
  
  , which
browns the blue with its black
  
   tint
  
  .
