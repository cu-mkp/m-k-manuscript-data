Lute for luting your molds

I have not found one that is made more quickly than this one, nor

better. Take this lean earth of which the founders of artillery

&amp; bells make their trusseaulx and

molds, which is lean &amp; sandy. Temper it

e moderately like a very thick mortar. Mix in

it about half horse dung, &amp; then have it

beaten well. Next, mix in a third part of discarded cloth

waste or shearings of cloth, and beat it again quite strongly.

You can reheat your mold as soon as the lute is

placed.
