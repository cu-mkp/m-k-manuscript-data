Color of burnished copper

Take one ounce of sal ammoniac with one
ounce of brouillamini and half of copper
filings with one ounce of sulfur & a 
half-septier of vinegar. Push it all into a small
tile oven and make a small charcoal fire around it, and put
your pot into the said oven for the whole
day.
