Vine leaf and small frog



Take vine leaves to mold as they are in growth, likewise with
all plants & flowers, or a young vine growing again after
having been cut, or when they rebud in autumn, because the
new leaves are more lumpy & have more apparent lineation. On the
contrary, old leaves are smooth on the inside & pierced in several
places. Therefore place your leaf bottom down on the clay
slab, and secure it with small points, nevertheless
leaving it its natural curve. And make a notch in the
clay to hide the stem at the first cast, which, once made
& dry, you will take away the stem from the leaf & clean with it
well with small bristle brushes & fix it with a small mound
of clay. Next, make several gates around the leaf with wax,
as you know, & gec make the gate thin & with
several lines & lumpy.




The vine leaf is painted with green made of stil de grain
yellow & verd de terre.




You can cast on the leaf a spider or frog &
whatever you will like.
