Azure

Turpentine oil renders it very beautiful. Test palma

christi seed oil.

Walnut oil in Flanders costs at least a hundred

sous a pint. The azure requires a little

fatty oil because it has no body.

Azur dâ€™esmail hates more than any other to be ground,

especially with water, for it dies &amp; loses all its color.

However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with

water but with oil &amp; grind it thickly, and in this

way it will not die as much.

Always choose the most delicate one.
