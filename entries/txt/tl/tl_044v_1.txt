Horsehair sieves

They are made at Coustance in Normandy with

horse tail hair which they clean with lye because

they sort them with the mouth &amp; separate out short

&amp; broken ones. They do not make the reed longer than the

sieve, &amp; the reed is round. They attach to both edges of

the reed the hair, either black or white, according to

the work they want to make. And the weft is is

done over &amp; under as for making any other fabric. And passing a

small flat stick of ii or three fingers wide

between, next they pass two hairs at each step of the pedal

and weave with three pedals. There are xviic

hairs in the entire sieve. They sell them by the dozen &amp; each dozen

xxx sous. They bring them to Toulouse to

transport them afterward to Spain, and take silk tammy

in exchange for it .
