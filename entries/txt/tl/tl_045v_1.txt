Loading an arquebus

You ought to have different charges according to the range that you

want to give to your arquebus, all of which should have a screw

on the end that fits in the nut of the ramrod of the

said arquebus. Thus, when you have put the powder in the charge,

which is in the nut, hold the ramrod upright. And

raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the

charge is at the bottom of the arquebus, then right the arquebus, the

mouth of the barrel up, and remove the little ramrod. Thus your

powder will be entirely in the breech without any of its grain or

dust attaching to the sides of the arquebus, which always has some filth

in the chamber. Thus it will not push back, and you will shoot more

true.
