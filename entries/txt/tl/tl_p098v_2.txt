 Salted
 
  artichokes
 

  One puts them whole & not too ripe in a
  
   firkin
  
  that one
fills with
  
   brine
  
  . Then, one serves them
  

    all
year
   

  among salads, raw with
  
   oil
  
  &
  
   vinegar
  
  ,
for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test
your
  
   brine
  
  with an
  
   egg
  
  , for if it is good & strong
enough, the
  
   egg
  
  will float on top. If not, it is not strong
enough and would not preserve the
  
   fruits
  
  .
