Lights

Your paintbrush shows it to you by casting a shadow

which must always follow the back of your hand, not in a

straight line like this,

    

for the light would be too crude &amp; too harsh, but obliquely &amp; as

if at an incline, thus:

    

It is necessary that the panel not be facing the

light head-on, but half turned

against it. And above all look for soft light, for it makes soft both

the shadow &amp; the work, as a harsh light a harsh

work.
