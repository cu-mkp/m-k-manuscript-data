Advice about the above

Good tin is that which is hard as silver
& soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
tin & alloyed as is said.

Looking-glass tin must not be <-smoked-> mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.

 Nor must the forms be smoked until then.

 If the sand shrinks in the frame, this means that it must
be reheated & reddened on the fire.

Good sand, when moistened, does not stick at all to the
hand when pressed.

The perfect sand for the frame is
aspalt, which is found in
Germany, which is soft as flour <-& presq->
when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.



Nota that the cast must be thin & hardly thick
in order that it does not overtax the material, and must not
exceed the thickness of <-un-> the width of a grain of
wheat; likewise for tin, which wants to be cast
very thinly. For lead, a little thicker. There is no need to make
the vents very large & deep either.


For frames, the sand that you use for the noyau, of the
aforesaid composition, is excellent. But in washing, crushing &
reheating it several times, it must be corrupt from its nature & no longer fit to make a hold & to mold en noyau.
