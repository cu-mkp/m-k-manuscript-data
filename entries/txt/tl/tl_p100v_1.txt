  Gemstones
 

  Take
  
   white pebbles that are found by the
   
    rivers
   
   &
among the
   
    sand bank
   
   &
   
    paths
   
   , which are
somewhat transparent
  
  , & if they are perfectly transparent it
will be better. If not, use the best & whitest that you can. Calcine
them three or 4 times in your
  

    four à vent
   

  , & extinguish
them in
  
   water
  
  or
  
   vinegar
  
  . Next, take a
  
   ℥
  
  of them and
  
   pestle
  
  them in a
  
   totally pure
   
    copper
   
   mortar
  
  & with a
  
   pestle of
pure
   
    copper
   

  , and grind them until they become very fine
& soft powder, and this is a sign that they have taken the substance
of
  
   copper
  
  , enough for giving them greenness. At that time, on your
  
   ℥
  
  of
  
   pebbles
  
  , put in three
  
   ℥
  
  of
  
   good minium, not adulterated by
brick
  
  & anything else, and grind everything together again very
well in a
  

    bronze
   
   mortar
  
  . And on all of this, put in a
  

    gros
   



    for
    
     ℥
    


  of
  

    sel de verre
   

  ;
& some & the
  
   common people
  
  put in
  

    e
   




   sandiver
  
  that they find at the
  
   glassmakers
  
  ' or
  
   apothecaries
  
  '. But
  
   alkali
salt
  
  , as you know, is better.

In this way, the
  
   common people
  
  make
  
   emeralds
  
  & cast in
  
   sand
  
  . If you do not have a
  

    bronze
   
   mortar
  
  , grind
  

    with
   


   a
   
    mort
   

  in a
  
   kettle
of pure
   
    copper
   

  .
 

  One needs to reheat
  
   crucibles
  
  before putting in materials, and
put them in the
  

    fornaise
   

  or
  

    four à
vent
   

  before making & increasing the fire.
  





  They are made in an
  

    hour & a half
   

  .
 

  A
  

    gros
   

  of
  
   salt
  
  on the four
  
   ℥
  
  of
  
   pebbles
  
  &
  
   minium
  
  . When
one says, for
  
   ℥
  
  , this is to be understood: on
one
  
   ℥
  
  of the body, & not
  



    Emerald
   





  of the
  
   salts
  
  & the
  
   minium
  
  .
