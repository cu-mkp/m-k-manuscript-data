  Because they sprout & flower among the first, & thus are
caught by the
  

    ch
   



    frost
   

  , one
lays them bare at the roots
  

    during winter
   

  in order that
  


     the winter
    


  the
  
   cold
  
  slows
them and that,
  

    le
   

  blossoming later, the flowers come to profit.
