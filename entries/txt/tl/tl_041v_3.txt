Colors and gilding on glass

One ought not to give as strong gum water on glass for

the gold layer as for silver layer as for the

gold layer because a silver leaf is twice as strong as a

gold leaf. Also, silver is harder and therefore does not

scratch as easily. Q And if the gum was not a

little strong for the silver, the latter would not split so

neatly. When you work, the humid the exhalation of your

breath moistens the leaf laid on the glass, &amp;

therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times.

You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank

&amp; serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not

quite clean of the gumâ€™s greasiness &amp; viscosity,

the &amp; of other things, the colors would not be so neat

on it. To advance your works, you can pounce, or, better still,

layer the gum &amp; leaf on a cut paper. In this way, you

will only need to repair very little. If you want to make gold color

there without gold, mix soaked dried saffron with a little

massicot.
