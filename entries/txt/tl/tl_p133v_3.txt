avoid putting points, which should not be put except at the
raising of the head, at the thickest places of the body & the simple
& delicate parts in the middle of the lizard’s feet, the
nails of which you will enter into the clay slab, in
order that they remain secure. When you have made the first cast &
uncovered the belly of the animal, do not forget to put small thin
<-s-> slabs of wax at the end of the
lizard’s legs. But, if it is a small wall lizard,
lightly cover with wax the entire bottom of the foot,
<-and-> and <-this-> the wax, being removed after
the second cast, leaves a cavity which fills these small fingers with
metal, & then one repairs them. Take heed therefore to attach
well with wax the parts of the animal which pass one over the
other, in order that the wetted sand entering between two does not take it
away. <-And if-> For if this were to happen, the <-mold
would spoil-> shape <-in the first place-> would
<-spoil-> corrupt & your mold also because it would
not have the thickness that <-il-> you think & would be
pierced & spoiled. And, even though to avoid this you can make the
mold thicker, however, should <-l-> this mishap
happen, you will be able to repair it in this way.
