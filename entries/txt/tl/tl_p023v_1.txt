On petards
Petards that one wants to place on doors or iron grates are
sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 lb. Moreover, as for its
charge, ball, & fashion of proceeding, one needs to do all as is
already said above, concerning the one of 3 quintals. One man
can carry it.

The ball needs to be be round on one side & flat on the other
like a half ball a half of a cut ball. It is also
necessary that the cross is held to the ball and that it, when the ball
is founded if you make it from metal, is bound up with the middle
of the cross.
