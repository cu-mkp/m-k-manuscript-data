  Counterfeit coral
 




   +
  


  One needs to first make the branches of
  
   wood
  
  or take a
bizarre
  
   thorn branch
  
  , then melt a
  
   lb
  
  of the most
beautiful
  
   clear pitch resin
  
  and put in one
  
   ounce
  
  of
  
   subtly ground vermilion
  
  with
  

    walnut
   
   oil
  
  , and if
you add in a little
  

    Venice
   

    laque platte
   

  , the
color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the
  
   resin
  
  melted
over a
  
   charcoal
  
  fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. 
Next dip in your branches while turning, & if any filaments
should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of the
  
   charcoal
  
  .
 



    Colophony
   

  is nothing other than recooked
  
   resin
  
  . To do
it well, take a
  

    leaded
   
   pot
  
  & melt the
  
   resin
  
  ,
& boil it over the
  
   brazier
  
  a good
  

    hour
   

  ,
& until it appears not to be thick, but clear & liquid like
  
   water
  
  , & easily runs & flows from the tip of a
  
   stick
  
  with which you grind it, & test it. Then pour it
through a
  

    coarse canvas
   

  or a
  

    very light tammy
cloth
   

  , such that when pouring it falls into the
strongest
  
   vinegar
  
  that you can find, for the
  
   vinegar
  
  gives
it strength & prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
or three times & it will be beautiful & well purified. For
counterfeiting your
  
   coral
  
  , you can mix a
  
   quarter part
  
  of
  
   mastic
  
  into your
  
   purified resin
  
  to render it more firm
and more beautiful, & if you were to take a single tear of
  
   mastic
  
  , it would be all the better, but it would be too long.
 


   Sulfur
  
  &
  
   vermilion
  
  makes the same effect.
 

  The
  
   coral
  
  made of
  
   gules red enamel
  
  endures the
  
   file
  
  and polishing.
 

  It is made like
  
   cement
  
  that is stronger mixed with
  

    pestled
   

    than of
   
   glass
  
  rather than with
  
   brick
  
  . Thus, here one
mixes well
  
   pestled
  

   gules red enamel
  
  , which
is red in body, with the
  
   vermilion
  
  . Thus with all colors of
  
   enamels
  
  .
