Soldering a vise

It is good that the jaws of the vise should be high to make
a long piece in it, and that the jaws join well to clamp a delicate
object. To solder the nut, after you have forged the
bolt, you <-will make-> will forge a long iron
strip <-quar-> of such thickness that it can fit
into the notch of the bolt when red hot, & you will bend it
<-po-> all around, striking it with a hammer.
Once it is well <-jo-> wrapped around, you will insert
<-it-> the bolt <-o-> around which
<-is-> it is wrapped.
