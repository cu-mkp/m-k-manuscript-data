For molding sulfur

Sulfur is made beautiful mixed with soot black or with

pulverized sanguine, which renders it harder and stronger. Having

let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like oil, mix it with

verdigris, and you m will very neatly cast in

plaster a lizard or something else.

One ought not to cast unless it is well cooled &amp; unless it

has lost all its pustules &amp; bubbles, and has settled down

well &amp; become smooth like  water. The

soot black gives it a fine sheen &amp; makes it neater. The most

beautiful yellow sulfur must be used, for the greyish &amp;

lively one is not good. Do not cast in wind &amp;

in cold, for it would become porous.
