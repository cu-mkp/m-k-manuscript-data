Sapphire

Stone cutters sometimes choose old pieces of antique
glass in church windows, which are much thicker than
those of today &amp; are of more lively colors. If it is for
souf sapphire, they choose beautiful blue
&amp; from such a place that there are no pieces
grains, if it is possible. And having cut it in squares with
emery, they cut it in bevel &amp; polish it. And in this manner,
they counterfeit very beautiful sapphires. The old 
esmail dâ€™azur for silver verging on aquamarine was very
appropriate for counterfeiting sapphires, but it is scarcely
found. One counterfeits aquamarines with white glass, but
they take it from the bottom of the glass.
