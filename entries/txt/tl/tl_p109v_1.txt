Toad



When it is big, one needs to mold it hollow, & if you want to make
it have an open mouth, put some cotton inside, & then on the
cotton some melted wax.
    

If by chance you want to mold this vile animal, & if it were to
piss in your hand, it would burn your hand
& itch, as if you had handled nettles. But the most
powerful remedy for this is to put your hand into
fresh earth & to cover it as if you wanted to bury it.
A frog is not so beautiful molded because it has lively skin,
& the other has a lumpy one.



You can mold it hollow, and leaving under its belly an open notch, you
will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw. Or else, if
it is small, put it on a magnet of its size, cut thinly, then
put it in good vinegar.
