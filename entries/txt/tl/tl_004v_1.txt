Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks,

&amp;c

Take linseed oil or more cheaply, walnut

oil, and rid it of grease with garlic &amp;

onions +hogâ€™s

fennel, some also add bread crusts, which you will

boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Next, put

in one lb of the oil thus boiled the size of a walnut of black

pitch &amp; a double handful of grains of wheat, without

removing the garlic &amp; onions, and let

it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And

when the pitch is well melted &amp; when the oil has body,

you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your

iron over a low charcoal fire &amp; apply your

varnish with a feather or a brush.

And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your

varnish is dry.

For excellent black varnish, add two or three paternoster

beads of jet among the rest.

Some consider walnut oil better.

If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least

half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It

is dangerous if it catches fire, if it goes over the top, and is

hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or an

open space.

 

In five or six lb of oil, one must put one lb

of galipot, which costs 4 sous, &amp; some

peeled garlic cloves. This varnish in and of

itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.

after sands, in the chapter on furbishers.
