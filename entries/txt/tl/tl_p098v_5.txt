Founding

The putty is made of burnt earth which has
served in the founding; this is earth bourre bolvene,
in <-[illegible]-> which one has founded. One grinds it on a big
stone, & with this one makes the
<-cope of-> first coat of the cope of
bells, where there are letters & works, & <-le->
only needs to be reheated in the flame of straw, and molds very
neatly.

The earth which molds en noyau is subject to making
it porous, if you do not rub well with a brush or your
finger the piece to be molded, which should be well
oiled. And do it coat by coat, & not all at once.










Earth or sand moistened or ground with water wants
to be reheated more than sand.

Latten from a candlestick is not pure, for one mixes in it
iron filings & potin.

Latten wants to be cast hotter than copper, quod
non credo.

To cast carefully, one ought not to take metals already
alloyed, but take them pure & mix them.

Iron hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of
copper or latten.

It is better to mold all with one sand, be it in a frame or
noyau, rather than in various mixed ones.




One ought to reheat for one or two hours <-and 
p->, in a fire <-that-> of charcoal which
lights by itself, a crucible with the substance inside, and
then blow & cover the crucible with large charcoals
& the mouth of the furnace with bricks, and
let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal, which
<-se-> fill the furnace above the
crucible. At the end, stoke it to a violent fire, & when the
flame is very white & the substance is in a liquid
bath like water & casting off pale blue flames,
cast. The secret is to cast very hot & in one go.
 

Lean white sand without bond renders quite 
proper for casting, &, having body, if
you grind it very finely on porphyry or calcine it,
reddening it several times in the fire, & spread it in
vinegar or finely grind it with water, as you know. It
also molds very neatly en noyau, as I have experimented. But do
not moisten it with salt water if you want to promptly reheat it,
for salt boils on the fire & makes pustules, being pressed by
the fire. I believe that the noyaulx, gently reheated, would not
do this. I molded very neatly en noyau the substance of
skillets. White sand smells like sulfur when
reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been
cast in it, it acquires in the mold
<-as-> a luster as if it were
leaded or vitrified. I believe that glassmakers could
use it.




One needs very little sal ammoniac dissolved in
water.
