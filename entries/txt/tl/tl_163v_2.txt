Crocum

That which is rusty by itself, being showered with salt water
or vinegar or urine and then th
dried out and reddened in fire, is very red ground on
porphyry and is of the color of Levant
bole, &amp; approaching minium. But that which is showered
with urine &amp; dried out acquires a deeper tincture
&amp; approaches crushed aes ustum or vermillion.
But the first one, finely ground, acquires a bright red color, in
the like cinnabar, in eau-de-vie. And the ones and
the others, prepared as said, and finely ground &amp; rendered very hot,
give off red fumes like a volatile spirit if, being thus hot
and fine, one throws on top vinegar, urine, or
eau-de-vie. Urine gives much tincture, and
eau-de-vie also.
