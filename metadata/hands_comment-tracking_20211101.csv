p002v_2,c_002v_07,"The remaining two entries on this folio are in a super-cursive hand, likely the author-practitioner's own in speed-writing mode (hand A'. See also fol. 157v)."
p009v_2,c_009v_03,"While the heading of this entry is in the Italic script of the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A), the remainder of this page is in a different hand (hand B, a formal Italic script)."
p020r_1,c_020r_01,"This entry is written in a different hand (hand C, a calligraphic French script) from the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A)."
p049r_2,c_049r_04,The rest of the entry shows a shift in the handwriting and may have been added at a later time.
p056v_1,c_057r_01,"From this point on, the writing is once more the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A)."
p056v_1,c_057r_02,"The following four paragraphs are in a different hand (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script)."
p057v_1,c_057v_01,"The entire page is written in a different hand (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script, see also fols. 57r and 58r) from the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A), with the exception of the title of the second entry, <i>Painctre</i>, and the final sentence on the page."
p057v_1,c_057v_02,This final sentence is in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A).
p057v_1,c_057v_04,This heading is written in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A) and was likely added at a later time.
p057v_2,c_058r_01,"This paragraph is in a different hand (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script, see fols. 57r–v) from the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A)."
p057v_2,c_058r_04,"From this point, the text is in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A)."
p073r_1,c_073r_01,"From this entry through fol. 76v, the hand is different (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script, likely the hand of a scribe) from the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A). See also fols. 57r–58r and 77r–79v."
p073r_1,c_073r_02,"This addition is in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A), glossing the word <i>fleurs</i> (flowers) written by the scribe (hand D); however, the author-practitioner seems unsure whether it should read <i>fleuree</i> (florey) or <i>Flandres</i> (Flanders)."
p073r_4,c_073r_03,"<i>Moullée</i> is added in a different hand, likely the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A), to fill in a blank left by the scribe (hand D) who wrote the rest of the page."
p073r_4,c_073v_02,"This page is part of a longer stretch (fols. 73r–76v) written in a different hand (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script, likely the hand of a scribe) from the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A). See also fols. 57r–58r and 77r–79v."
p077r_4,c_077r_01,"From this entry through fol. 79v, the hand is different (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script, likely the hand of a scribe) from the author-practitioner's main one (hand A). See also fols. 57r–58r and 73r–76v."
p077r_1,c_077r_02,This is the first of three consecutive entries on this page written in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A).
p077v_3,c_077v_03,"In context, this is clearly sandarac. Variants of this issue occur on fols, 77v, 78r, and 79v. The scribe (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script) had difficulty understanding the word ""sandarac,"" writing homophones and perhaps interpreting the term as <i>sang</i> (blood) <i>de Drac</i> (of the dragon) or <i>da Rac</i> (the devil's shout). This may indicate that dictation was used in the composition of this manuscript."
p077v_1,c_077v_04,"This page is part of a longer stretch (fols 77r–79v) in a different hand (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script, likely the hand of a scribe) from the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A); see also fols 57r–58r and  73r–76v. "
p078r_1,c_078r_02,"This heading repeats the same phrase <i>pour faire bois verd</i> (for making green wood) that concludes the previous entry. This might indicate that the scribe (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script), perhaps taking dictation, did not realize these words were meant to begin a new entry. Moreover, in each instance, the scribe writes <i>trois</i> (three) for <i>bois</i> (wood). Might this indicate a noisy workshop environment as the scribe took dictation?"
p079r_1,c_079r_01,"Three horizontal strokes may indicate the scribe (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script) experienced difficulty while taking dictation.They likely occupy a space for materials initially misunderstood or omitted. It is unclear whether those materials are still missing or if the strokes now fill the gap to continue the sentence."
p079v_2,c_079v_02,"This entry, written in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A), marks the conclusion of the longer stretch on fols. 77r–79v written in hand D (a semi-calligraphic French script, likely the hand of a scribe); see also fols. 57r–58r and 73r–76v."
p079v_1,c_079v_03,"This entry and the next are part of a longer stretch (fols. 77r–79v) in a different hand (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script, likely the hand of a scribe) from the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A); see also fols. 57r–58r and 73r–76v. "
p157v_3,c_157v_02,"This entry is added across the entire bottom of the page in a different, super-cursive hand (hand A', see also fol. 2v). "
p161r_1,c_161r_03,This entry was written in various inks and hands. This may indicate later additions and provide clues to authorial intent and composition of text.
p161r_1,c_161r_04,"Latin: ""Note."" See corresponding marginal note that begins with the same mark and word, which are both written in a super-cursive hand, likely the author-practitioner's own in speed-writing mode (A', less cursive here than on fols. 2v and 157v). He seems to have initially placed this intervention in the previous sentence, then changed his mind."
p170v_1,c_170v_12,"This whole page is upside down. The first half of this page (now found at the bottom) is in a different hand (hand E, semi-calligraphic) and records payments of rent to the heirs of Sieur Ouvrier. It is struck through with diagonal lines and is separated from the subsequent text by a horizontal line. The second half of the page (now at the top), is in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A). This suggests that he took a bound, mostly-blank book—perhaps a book recording accounts such as the ones found here—struck through the account records, and began to record medical recipes and a list of titles under them. Then, when he ran out of room, he flipped the entire book over, turned it upside down, and began writing on what now is the first folio of the manuscript (fol. 1r)."
