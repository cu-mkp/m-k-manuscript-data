See <i>A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues</i> (London: Adam Islip, 1611), http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cotgrave. In the context of the manuscript, this material is used to make crucibles and molds for tin casting, and so it is more likely a stone (perhaps similar to schist or sandstone) which was used by pewterers for casting dishes.

        <comment><i>Adoulcir</i> can mean to soften, sweeten, and smooth, meanings that converge within a worldview in which all things have a natural balance. Sour and brittle (<i>aigre</i>) materials can be rendered sweet and soft (<i>doulx</i>) with the right tempering substance, thus while we have translated adoulcir as "to soften" here, the author-practitioner's understanding was simultaneously of "sweetening," which involved a process of "tempering" and "mollifying" (as Cotgrave's 1611 Dictionarie also gives) or of bringing a material or process toward a new, more desirable or useful balance among its qualities, or in its outcome.

        <comment>In <i>Codex Atlanticus</i>, fol. 207r, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) attributes this joke to Maestro Giovanni da Lodi. Leonardo's version was "How to teach what you do not know: If you want to teach something to someone that you do not know, have him measure the length of something that you do not know and he will know the measure, which previously, you did not know." Luca Pacioli (ca. 1447–1517), Franciscan friar, mathematician, and Leonardo's collaborator, also quotes this joke, which he includes in the section of "vernacular <i>problemata</i> meant to stimulate intelligence and mirth" of his <i>De viribus quantitatis</i>, a manuscript available at the Biblioteca Universitaria di Bologna (codice 250).

        <comment>In context, this is clearly sandarac. Variants of this issue occur on fols, 77v, 78r, and 79v. The scribe (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script) had difficulty understanding the word "sandarac," writing homophones and perhaps interpreting the term as <i>sang</i> (blood) <i>de Drac</i> (of the dragon) or <i>da Rac</i> (the devil's shout). This may indicate that dictation was used in the composition of this manuscript.</comment>

        <comment>This heading repeats the same phrase <i>pour faire bois verd</i> (for making green wood) that concludes the previous entry. This might indicate that the scribe (hand D, a semi-calligraphic French script), perhaps taking dictation, did not realize these words were meant to begin a new entry. Moreover, in each instance, the scribe writes <i>trois</i> (three) for <i>bois</i> (wood). Might this indicate a noisy workshop environment as the scribe took dictation?</comment>

        <comment>This whole page is upside down. The first half of this page (now found at the bottom) is in a different hand (hand E, semi-calligraphic) and records payments of rent to the heirs of Sieur Ouvrier. It is struck through with diagonal lines and is separated from the subsequent text by a horizontal line. The second half of the page (now at the top), is in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A). This suggests that he took a bound, mostly-blank book—perhaps a book recording accounts such as the ones found here—struck through the account records, and began to record medical recipes and a list of titles under them. Then, when he ran out of room, he flipped the entire book over, turned it upside down, and began writing on what now is the first folio of the manuscript (fol. 1r).</comment>

        <comment>The Ouvrier family (sometimes d’Ouvrier) was a prominent family in Toulouse (late 15th–18th c.), with some of its members serving in the city Parliament. Benoît Ouvrier (d. 1573), a merchant who owned a house located on the “rue des Fleurs,” near the Mint, is probably the <i>feu sr Ouvryer</i> mentioned here. The Ouvrier family had ties to the Du Cros family (see fol. 9v) through two marriages, one between Jean Ouvrier and Anne Du Cros in 1586, and the other between Gabriel Ouvrier (his brother) and Françoise Du Cros in 1592.
