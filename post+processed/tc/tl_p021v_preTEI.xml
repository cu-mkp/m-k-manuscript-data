night, they push their <wp>cannon</wp> straight toward the above-mentioned
<tl>ruler</tl> &amp; make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on the
end of the aforesaid <tl>ruler</tl>. Next, they measure with a

side of the <wp>cannon</wp> &amp; if it is too close or too far from it, they
adjust it &amp; do thus from the side of the other pole.</ab></div>

<head>For unspiking a <wp>cannon</wp></head>

<ab>Some say that one should remove the ball if the <wp>cannon</wp> is loaded
&amp; give fire through the mouth of the <wp>cannon</wp>. But it is to be
believed that the fire would sooner exit that way than going to seek its
exit through its usual touch-hole<comment rid="c_021v_02"/> which is
spiked &amp; constrained. The most reliable way is that the
<pro>gunner</pro>, who is often a <pro>founder</pro>, wedges &amp;
thoroughly rivets the <tl>nail</tl> that the enemies placed, and with a
<tl>trepan</tl> makes <del>at the side</del> another touch-hole next to
the one which has been spiked, which will be done in an hour. And if
with time the violence of the <m>powder</m> loosens the <m>nail</m> with
which the <wp>piece</wp> is spiked, you will make a thread in the second
touch-hole &amp; place a <tl>screw</tl> in it quite perfectly which will
never come undone.<del><fr>M</fr></del></ab></div>

<head>Defense of a town</head>

<ab>There is nothing that has a greater effect for the defense of a
    breach than <wp>petards</wp><comment rid="c_008r_04"/> placed at the entryway at the time of the assault.
They carry a lot of ammunition. <del><fr>be</fr></del> One fills them
with <m>cart nails</m>, <m>large steel dice</m>, <m>bits of chain</m>
&amp; similar things. And when one senses that the enemies are close,
one sets fire to all. <wp>Grenades</wp>, too, well-made and aptly thrown, cause
great damage. And to make them worse, one puts <m>coarsely
<del><tl>pestling</tl></del> <tl>pestled</tl> glass</m> either in the <tl>molds</tl> or in the
<oc>crucible</oc>, when one wants to cast them; this worsens the <md>wounds</md>.
The <wp>grenades</wp> ought not to be too brittle. But it is good that they be
somewhat alloyed with the <m>substance of the pieces</m> in order that,
holding the blast a little rather than breaking, they have more
violence.</ab></div>
