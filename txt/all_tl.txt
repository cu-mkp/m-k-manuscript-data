Against plague
Against pestilential fever or poison or plague, take an ecu's weight
of your opiate  soaked in scabious  or bugloss
extract , or heavily diluted wine , if you are already ill.
After taking it, you must make yourself sweat.

To preserve oneself
Acetum  paratum ex ruta baccis juniperi  simul
tusis Eo aceto  extinguantur lateres  igniti. Et vapor
excipiatur ore & naribus. Rue vinegar  together with
crushed juniper berries . Pour the vinegar  over red hot
bricks  and inhale the vapor through the mouth and nostrils. This
is to preserve oneself when going into noxious air: a garment can be
perfumed with this vapor in order to remove infection from a room,
house, etc. And if you find yourself in a place where you do not have
this preparation, carry rue  and berries  crushed together,
then, if need be, boil them in vinegar  and use as described.
