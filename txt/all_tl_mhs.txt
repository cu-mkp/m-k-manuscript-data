<div>Counterfeit coral 
+ One needs to first make the branches of wood  or take a
bizarre thorn branch , then melt a lb  of the most
beautifulclear pitch resin  and put in one ounce  of
subtly ground vermilion  with walnut  oil , and if
you add in a little Venice  lake platte  , the
color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the resin  melted
over a charcoal  fire and not of flame, for fear that the fire
catches within. Next dip in your branches while turning, & if there
should remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the
charcoal .
Colophony  is nothing other than resin  cooked again. To do
it well, take a leaded  pot  & melt the resin ,
& boil it over the brazier  a good hour  ,
& until it appears not to be thick, but clear & liquid like
water  & it easily runs & flows from the tip of a
stick  with which you grind it, & try it. Then pour it
through a coarse canvas   or a very light tammy
cloth  , in the manner that when pouring it falls into the
strongest vinegar  that you can find, for the vinegar  gives
it strength & prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
or three times & it will be beautiful & well purified. For
imitating your coral , you can mix a quarter part  of
mastic  within your purified resin  to render it more firm
and more beautiful, & if you should take only a tear of
mastic , it would be all the better, but it would be too long.


Sulfur  & vermilion  makes the same effect.

The coral  made of gules red enamel  endures the
file  and polishing.

It is made like cement  that is stronger mixed with crushed
than of  glass  rather than with brick . Thus one
mixes here with the vermilion  the gules red enamel , which
is red in body, well ground. Thus with all colors of
enamels .
</div><div>Varnish  for panels
Take a lb  of Venice  turpentine  & heat
it in a pot  until it simmers, and put in half a lb  of
the turpentine oil  of the whitest you can find, and stir it all
together well on a charcoal  fire and take it off immediately. And
elle   it is done. But if it seems too thick to you,
add in a little more oil . Similarly if it is too clear, you can
thicken it by putting a little turpentine . Thus you will give it
whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when
heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings
and other painted things without distorting the colors or yellowing. And
it dries both in the shade  and in the sun , and
overnight , and during the winter  as well as
in the summer . It is usually sold 15 sols  a
lb .

A little more turpentine  than turpentine oil  is needed in
order to give body to the varnish , which needs to be applied with
finger   in order to spread it thinner and less thick,
for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not
varnish  to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out
of them.

But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them
from dust. Mastic varnish  does not resist rain ,
whereas that of oil  and rosin  does.
</div><div>Thick varnish  for floorboards
There is a varnish  that takes a long time to dry & still
drips up to two months  after it has been applied to the
floorboards. But this one does not drip like the one used in the
past , which was made of linseed oil  boiled with
garlic , to extinguish it & take out the fattiness, & with
wheat . And this one yellowed & made the blue color of
paintings greenish. This one is made like the other one except that one
puts common thick turpentine 
 </div> 003v
<div> instead of fine turpentine . And you can put into two
lbs  of tou common turpentine  one lb 
of fine turpentine oil  & proceed as with the other one. This
one will cost you no more than five or six sols   per
lb  & is sold for 40 sols   per
lb .
 This vessel  is used to make large quantities of
turpentine oil , that is to say a bucket  an
hour  . And no matter which turpentine  it may be,
whether fine or coarse. One needs to give, as you know, a little fire at
the beginning. And always keep cold water  in the cooler on the
top. The lb  is sold at xii sols  , & at the
bottom of the vessel  remains the colophony , known as
pix graeca  . Eau de vie  are also made well in this
vessel  and there is no need to distill it again. You do not
need a small oven  for this copper vessel , but
only charcoal  around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is
round, you will place it on a trivet .

@ It is better to heat the varnish  a little bit, rather than to
put it out in the sun , because this makes the panel
warp.

@ Some say it is not good to distil in this copper 
vessel  because it is made green. However, when tinned , it is
good.
</div><div>For varnishing
Turpentine varnish  does not need any glue  because it
is fat and viscous and it is not absorbed in the wood  like that
of spike lavender  and sandarac . Also, that ofspike
lavender  does not require any glue  on iron  &
similar materials that do not absorb, but on wood  and on colors
which have <add>do not have</add>gum  or colle
de destrempe  , it is necessary to lay one coat of the said colle de retailles   & to let it dry & to
varnish.
</div> 004r
<div>Varnish of spike lavender oil 
One needs to heat lavender spike oil  and as it begins to
simmer, put in powdered sandarac gum  so that it soon melts. And
over a charcoal  fire stir continuously until the sandarac 
is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
varnish  on a plate . And if it is fatty when you handle
it with a finger  , it is ready. And for one lb 
of lavender spike oil , you will put five ounces  of
pulverized sandarac , although some only put in four
ounces , but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is
promptly dry. Framemakers , to avoid the trouble of polishing
their ebony , varnish it with this, as do guitarmakers .
This is not as appropriate for panels as that of fine turpentine ,
though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to
varnish the landscape of a panel when linseed varnish  was in use,
because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of
turpentine , one varnishes everything. You can put in
pulverized mastic  extracted in tears or otherwise, and it will be
more dessicative in place of sandarac .
If you want to varnish on plaster  or a wall, first put on
your very hot colle de retaille  , because if cold it
would not penetrate the wall, & when you would put your
varnish  on, it would come off.
Varnish of spike lavender oil  is not as appropriate for colors as
that of turpentine , for spike lavender oil makes them
die <add>eats away at</add> the colors since it is too
penetrating.
</div><div>To remove varnish  from an old panel that has yellowed &
varnish it anew
Take white soap  & sieved  ashes , &
soak both in water . And with a sponge , take the said
ashes  & soap  & rub the panel with them. And as you
see that the old varnish  is removed, throw a
bucket   of water  against the panel to clean it.
Next put it for a quarter of an hour  in the
sun  to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel
dries, you can apply your turpentine varnish .


Make sure the colors do not come off.
</div> 004v
<div>Black varnish  for sword guard, bands for trunks,
&c.
Take linseed  oil  or more cheaply, walnut 
oil , and rid it of grease with garlic   &
onions   <add>+ hog's
fennel   some also add bread crusts </add>, which you will
boil in it for a good quarter of an hour  . Next, put
in one lb  of the oil  thus boiled a piece of black
pitch the size of a walnut   & a double
handful  of grains of wheat   , without removing the
garlic   & onions   and let it boil
together for a good quarter of an hour  . And when the
pitch  is well melted & when the oil  has body, you can
remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your iron  over a
low charcoal  fire & apply your varnish  with a
feather  or a brosse  . And when you see that it
no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish  is dry.

For excellent black varnish , add two or three paternoster
beads  of jet  among the rest.

Some consider walnut  oil  better.

If there is a lot of varnish , it needs to boil for at least
half a day  , for it is better the more it boils. It
is dangerous if the fire catches within, if it goes over the top, and is
hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard  or an
open space .

In five or six lb  of oil , one must put one lb 
of galipot , which costs 4 sols  , & some
peeled garlic  cloves . This varnish  in and of
itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.

See below, around the 3rd part of this book, after sands, in the chapter
on furbishers .
</div><div>Black varnish  without fire, without disassembling the
harnesses or removing the bands from trunks
Take varnish of spike lavender  oil  & mix it with
soot black  or lampblack , & without fire it will mix in
by itself. Varnish with a brosse   & it will soon be
dry. Turpentine varnish  will be quite good, but it does not dry
as soon.
</div><div>Varnish ofiron engravers  
Take linseed  oil  or walnut  oil 
&, in place of black pitch , you will put in a little
resin , & it needs to be cooked in the manner of black
varnish  on fire. And for applying it, heat your iron  &
give it only one layer of varnish , & when it no longer
smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a steel  point 
whatever you want. Next <add>take</add>salt  &
verdigris  & soak as much of one as of the other in quite
strong vinegar  & leave it for XX4 hours  
before using it, & all will be soaked. Next spread some of this
liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a sponge 
 </div> 005r
<div> or linen   & leave it thus for xx4
hours   & it will be engraved. But if you should
want to engrave quickly, varnish all your work & boil it in the
aforesaid liquor, and it will engrave quickly.
</div><div>Steel  mirrors
+ They are called of steel  because in the
past they were commonly made of steel  polished with
potée  of emery . But more easily, various kinds are made
of cuivre franc  , which is rosette , and
tin , because this can be cast in a mold  & made
round, concave, convex & however you like, to produce various
forms.
So take half  of rosette copper  & half 
of soft tin , that is to say fine, which has not yet been used.
Put them in a crucible , & first melt the copper 
well. And once it is well melted, put in the tin  and mix
together. Then cast in the mold, of white stone  with no
eyelets , & grease the mold  with oil , & let
the mold   be moderately warm. Then, having
molded  your mirror, you can polish it in this manner.
Set one of these in plaster  in order that it holds firmly,
& then put the other one over it with thin sand  in between,
& rub one against the other, whether hollow or flat, & thus you
will polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides,
you only need to switch them, which means putting the one that was
polishing into the plaster  & using the one that was in the
plaster  to polish. After having polished them with the
arene    you can soften them with tripoli
of Venice   , which should not be sandy, & after with
potée   . You polish with
arene    using water , but polishing with
tripoli   & potée    is done
dry. Once polished, you can set it.
</div><div>Concave mirrors
The concave mirror composed in the aforesaid form produces an
endless number of illusions which seem magic. If someone wants to see
oneself from behind, it is necessary to place the concave
mirror  on the ground on its foot, & let it be at a slant;
after, <add>look</add>  at it one step  away. But if you
look  at it closer up, it will show you the right way up but
with your face  quite large & the hairs of your
beard  as thick as
 </div> 005v
<div> string & will reflect a nipple  as large as a plate, and
women  can see the secret places  that they do not
want to show to surgeons . It casts the representation out of
itself, and if you touch le lieu   the eye of
the representation with your finger , another finger 
will come against yours.
You will make a light at night  for someone quite far
away, if you place the concave mirror  behind a candle 
placed on the window  . You can read and write quite
far from the candle  if you place it behind the candle 
& place <add>& turn</add> the concavity towards you. If you put
the mirror at the end of a table   & a
candle  on it, it will represent two lights on the
table  for you. To see what is happening on a street ,
shutter the window , and the more you can shut there the
better. Make a hole at the lower pane, the size of your little
finger  , perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
place a sheet of paper   on the window  
& let the middle of the sheet   be over the hole.
Pierce the sheet  in the same place as the hole & the same
size. After, aim the concave face of the mirror  towards the
hole, & it will represent for you anyone passing by in the
street  on the sheet of paper  . Similarly with
the pierced door of a closed room . You can make wavy ones
& triangular ones, of the sort described by Ptolemy  &
Archimedes . The concave one also sets fire to straw ,
lights a candle  from afar, using the sun . By
reverberating fire too, it heats.
</div><div>For bronzing in yellow and white
Take looking-glass tin  and melt it. On half a lb  of
this, put half an ounce  of quicksilver , and remove it
all at once from the fire & grind it, and it will be like
ash . Grind  Wash it quite well in clean water .
After, grind it on marble   & soak it with water of
ret  colle de retailles  . After, apply to
your wooden  candlesticks  & any other work you like,
& burnish with the tooth . You can grind pin filings 
and apply them with the said glue . 
</div> 006r
<div>For laying down and setting burnished gold  and giving red
or green or blue
Ceruse  & lead white  is not appropriate for polished
white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for
or mat  that is made with oil  by mixing it with yellow
ochre  & mine p o  & by tempering
all of it with oil . And this or mat  thus applied keeps
in the rain  like gilded leadwork  & similar things.
Therefore for burnished gold  take good chalk, quite white,
well ground , & soaked with distemper glue , & make
four layers of it, one after the other, on the wood . And once the
last is dry, rub it with prele   , which is a
plant otherwise called horsetail  , to render it well
polished. Next take fine Armenian  bole  &
sanguine , as much of one as of the other, lamb
 tallow  as large as a bean   or a
pea   depending on the quantity of bole , and a
little of willow  charcoal  or as much as the
tallow , & half a walnut  shell  full of
half-burned saffron  . Some put in a little candi
sugar . Grind all together with water , & apply it without
gum  or glue , & let it dry, & rub the place that
you want to gild with a piece of white cloth  to better make
even, & when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that
the gold  will carry itself well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean
pinceau   soaked in clear water  the place that
you want to gild & immediately apply the gold , which you will
burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in rouge clair  
& glaze with it de  , grind Venice
 lake platte   on marble   with
walnut  oil  or linseed  . Once ground, mix
turpentine varnish or spike lavender   & apply on the
gold  with the pinceau  .
Brazilwood   & lake ronde   die. For
green, temper verdigris  with walnut oil   or
linseed   & grind, next mix in turpentine varnish
and not of spike lavender  , which is not suitable for
verdigris . If you want to glaze with azure , it needs to be
set on burnished silver  and take azur d’esmail  ,
&, without grinding, temper it with turpentine varnish  &
apply it.


</div> 
>006v
<div>For ga  cach  cages
You can embellish them with thin enamel canes   of
various colors by covering the latten or iron wire  with the said
thin canes . These you will break neatly to the length that you
want if you slightly notch with a cutting file  at the place to
be broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend
<add>them</add> with a wood  model  over a
chafing-dish  or else by the heat of the lamp . It can
also be drawn as long as you want in a small furnace  made like
a reverberatory furnace  but which is pierced on both sides. And
when the big thin cane  is red, they seize the hot end using
small pincers with a long beak , such that one prong of the beak
of the small pincers  enters inside the end of the thin
cane , & thus it is lengthened without becoming stopped, &
the other end of the thin cane  is held with the hand ,
because it is not hot. When the thin cane  is stretched enough,
the one who works seated, having his small  furnace ,
the size of a carnation  pot , before him,
<corr>breaks</corr> it off & continues. This is for making thin
canes  for capes, which are cut as already mentioned, and with a
file . Glass-button makers  also avail themselves of
the said furnace .
 
Under the door is a grill  that supports the lit charcoal, &
the ash  is emptied by turning the furnace  upside
down.
</div><div>For stamped ornaments used for embellishing and inserting into or

Etch with aqua fortis  on iron  or copper 
whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next make it neat with a
burin  or chisel . Then pour doulx  tin ,
yet unused, onto polished marble   & flatten it,
making it quite thin, with a wooden  board . Or else pour
it on a table  as is done with lead , or put it through a
roll-press . Next lay your tin  plate over the engraving,
& over the tin  plate put a piece of felt   and
strike it with a hammer . Then gild  it in the following
manner.
</div> 007r
<div>For gilding with gold color  and tinsel 
Once you have gilded <add>colored</add>, make your
stamped ornament in tin  as said, or in iron dest   or copper , one ought not to put a layer
ofglue  here as on wood , but take only fatty oil ,
which is made in seven or eight days in the sun  with
walnut oil  and lead white & with , stirring
it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in haste. Then, with the
oil  thus made fatty, grind a little lead white ,
massicot  & mine de plomb    ,
at discretion, as much of one as of the other. Minium  gives color
to the gold . Next, with this, you make a layer of it evenly on
your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows. And once it is almost
dry, lay the gold  leaf on it with cotton . Such gold 
will hold up in the rain  on houses & elsewhere. And if
you have gilded with tinsel , color it with fumée de
perdrix   or from yellow or red cloth , & it will be
beautiful like pure gold . You can cover trunks, mirrors, canopies
& posts of beds of colored velvet  or satin  and then
apply the gilded stamped ornament on them with strong glue .
</div><div>For coloring stamped trunks
The stamp of sheets of copper or latten  is made on
service tree wood  engraved & cut should you want to
spend less. And next, the stamped object is colored with the aforesaid
colours of lake , verdet , azur d’esmail  ,
& soak in turpentine varnish . But in the place you want to
azure , lay down fer blanc  , which is more
appropriate for an azure  background.

Because millet   is naturally very dry,
harvesters  beat it most often at night in the cool
& by moonlight  . Which could not be done with another
grain  that is wetter, for one le  must let the
sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the sun is
approaching midday . Quickly after the millet   is
cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats & thins it as
much as if the millet   was still standing. The ground
where the millet   will have been sown is quite
diminished of its fertility & c , which one knows
well at the next sowing  that one makes. But above
all the grain  called pomole   in Gascony 
or baillard   in northern  France ,
makes, according to the common saying, the earth shake seven
years  later. Beans  improve & enrich the soil, as
long as one lets the roots & stems rot in it.

formulary for apprentices , by which they can know how much
every item of merchandise costs & co  for how much
it should be sold. The second is the waste book, where they put down in
rough what they sell daily. The third is the sales book, where they
reduce to clean copy and put the retail account of what is contained in
the waste book. The fourth is the account book, which mentions the sale,
the balanced account, the bill & the term of payment, & this

They completely melt orpiment  in a glass 
bottle  on very hot ashes, but it would be more appropriate to
sublimate orpiment  in a long-necked matrass  as for
making garnets . The orpiment  thus turns red like red
enamel  & one needs to grind it damp because once completely
melted it is very lively & difficult to grind. Next, you can
br   thin it, once dry, with oil  & it will
make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent orpiment 
from dying with the other colors & to render it compatible with
these & to make it dry promptly, it is held a very rare secret to
calcine common salt  & to grind it within. Green
verditer  is not used with oil .

<div>Counterfeit jasper 
Take horn  from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, &
underneath make the figure of your jasper , cornalines ,
& other stones , which will be a work more appropriate than on
glass , which is too shiny. And the horn  presents a lustre
& a fatty polish like jasper .
You know, as with scrapings of the said horn , the
roses   can be imitated. The horn  colors for
this jasper  wants to have a base with clear turpentine  or
spike lavender  varnish . <add>And colors matte in body
are not so appropriate here, however beautiful they are.</add><add>One

Thin glass , for this effect, is very beautiful.


You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the
filings of talc or of pins  on the fresh cement  of the said
joints. One needs to join them with gum ammoniac  mixed in
vinegar . To better counterfeit marbled jasper , apply
wool of thick hairs  dyed in diverse colors & intermingled.
After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them,
then lay down gold &silver leaf . If you lay down on the
horn  colors of turpentine , give it a base of silver 
or of tin leaf . You can also file horn  & mix
it with strong glue , & lay it down onto the joints of the
piece of horn , then even it with a plane .

Painters  make it beautifully by making the first layer of
common azur , or better yet azur d'esmail  , &
next they glaze it with lake , which will be more appropriate for
this if you mix in alum , which gives it a violet tint depending
on the quantity that you mix in.
</div><div>Powder  for sand glasses
It is made very fine & without being subject to rust & by
its weight able to flow; taking i lb  of lead , melt it
and skim and purify it from its filth, then pour into it four
℥   of finely pulverized common salt , and
take good care that it contains no stones  nor earth . And
immediately after you have poured it, mix continuously very well with an
iron   until the lead  and salt  are well
incorporated, and lift it immediately from the fire, stirring
continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on
marble   and pass it through a fine sieve . Then
wash it so many times that the water sembl  
becomes clear, throwing away that little powder  which will swim
on it, renewing the water  so many times that it stays entirely
uniform.

<div>For painting in oil  on taffeta <add>without the

One needs to make a layer of batture  , which is made
of well cooked honey & turpentine   of colle
forte   soaked for 24 hours  in water  then gently
brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little
honey  to soften it, & make it boil all together. And on top
of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in
oil , which will soften the layer even more, and which can also
serve to make a ground layer for gold . Water of alum  also
keeps oil  from running.
</div><div>Ground layer for gold leaf  on parchment  or

Hard-boil eggs, divide them in half & take the yolk out,
& between the two halves of the white  put a piece of
ceruse , & tie them together with thread . Then boil

the ceruse  will be purified. Some reheat it over fire & it
becomes very white.
</div> 011r
<div>Painting esmail d’azur  in oil 
This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters .
Some take the most delicate they can & grind it with ceruse ,
which binds it, and next prick with an awl  in several places
the area they want to paint with azur d’esmail , such that the
oil  enters & leaks in, & <add>ne </add> does not
cause the azure , which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the
panel flat & put down the azure  on it, which is also done
à destrempe . The main thing is to grind it well on
marble  , and before that, to have washed it thoroughly.
Some grind it with  thoroughly with an egg yolk  &
then wash it in five or six waters    and lay it
on not with a painceau  , which would be too soft, but
with a broisse   thoroughly softened & crimped,
& laying it on thickly as if one were putting it down with a
trowel ; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have
experienced that grinding azur d’esmail   with egg
yolk  & next washing it in several waters   is
good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it.
I have also washed it in several waters   &, when it
had settled a little, I removed the water  , still
q  blue, with a sponge  and squeezed it into another
vessel thus <add>where it settled, & from the
residue</add> I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the
azure  without grinding it, which is the best, for in the grinding
of it, it loses some of its tint. Those who make it in Germany 
compound it like enamel , in large pieces which they pestle, &
pass through several sieves  & wash.
To make azures  beautiful, they wash or soak them in a
rock water   , as they call it; it is a
water  distilled from mines where azure  or vert
d'azur   is found, which distills naturally through the
veins of the mountain  or is distilled through an
alembic par   from mineral stones of
azure  or copper .
<add>Azure</add> ash  are only good for landscapes because
they die in oil . Only true azure  holds on. Azur
d’esmail  cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on
the fingernail   or the oil  palette . If
it    happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with
the egg yolk  or, better yet, wash it in clear
water   & with a sponge  remove the colored
water   after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner
you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work
with.

</div><div>For diamond  points  for engraving
These are for tracing what you want to draw on stones  &
engrave, & when these points  are fatty & cannot bite,
one needs to rub them diamond  against diamond . One rubs
them with diamond pumice stone powder  . One
needs also to unpolish on a lead  wheel  either the
stone  or the glass  on which you want to engrave, for the
polish, which is like varnish  on glass , prevents the
diamond  or sapphire  from biting well. But  This
is why it does not bite easily on the hoof , which is polished
& fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites
easily.
</div><div>Polishing wheel of copper  
Before polishing your stone on it, it is necessary to degrease
ter   it well, rubbing it with a piece of

spinning the wheel , if you have not worked on it in a long
time.

<div>Molding sulfur 
Sulfur  is made beautiful mixed with soot black  or with
pulverized sanguine , which renders it harder and stronger. Having
let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like oil , mix it with
verdigris , and you m   will cast in
plaster  very neat a lizard , or something else.


You must not cast that which has not become well cooled & that which
has not lost all its pustules & bubbles, and has not settled down
well & become smooth like   water . The
soot black  gives it a fine luster & makes it neater. The most
beautiful yellow sulfur  must be used, for the greyish &
lively sulfur  is not good. Do not cast in wind  &
cold , for it would become porous.
</div><div>Chimolee  
The terre chimolee   , otherwise known as
fuller ’s earth , with which they dress the
cloth , is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you
want to reheat it, it must first be warmed, & reheat it gently on a
low, indirect fire, & little by little, otherwise it would crack.
Put the figure to reheat in a pot  in an oven , or in a
covered oven . It is very malleable, clean & fine. <add>You
can make a cavity for animals of chimolee   & cast
lead  in it.</add>


The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 days  before you reheat
it. When you mold & make a cavity from chimolee  , do
not press too hard, but softly, for it would break.
</div><div>Paper 
The whitest & finest is the best. And when the cavity is quite
clean, as of sulfur  or baked chimolee  , it is made
very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of white  with a
border of gold  to imitate alabaster . And after you have
applied the white , you can burnish it with the tooth .
But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to mix the lead
white  with glair of egg  & peelings from the fig
tree  . Or better, varnish your work with white varnish .
In addition when you are molding with paper , as it starts to dry,
burnish from the back with the tooth .
</div><div>Plaster 
That from the mountains  is greyer, and the  the
one from the region of Albi  is whiter. It must be heated over a
closed fire, such as a reverberatory furnace  or fours
de barbiers  . And the most freshly cooked is the best. It must
be finely ground on marble  . After having prepared your
cavity from sulfur  or something else, & oiling  it,
& having enclosed it in a <corr>circle</corr>, temper not too
thickly your plaster  with water , & separate it well
with your finger  , and if it makes pustules, throw in
more powder of the said plaster  &    grind it
with the finger   until + 
+  it makes no more pustules. Then cast & sprinkle
again with plaster powder  & leave to set well, then scrape
off the powder.

<div>Moulding stucco  quickly
Grind & pulverize finely brick  or Armenian 
bole  or sanguine  & incorporate it with melted wax ,

plaster , crushed paper  or terre chimolee .


Finely sieved brick  is better, because the bole  is too
fat

</div><div>For whitening enilanroc 
Some think that the crust of ceruse  color which is natural on
top, others say that it is a secret of ancient lapidaries 
that is lost, others say that it is reheated enamel . And by means
of the said crust, multiple ciphers, letters, circles
st   & other bizarre things can be formed. As for
the method, I have practiced thus. Once I wished to give it a layer of
arsenic  ground on marble  . However, I experimented
without this, and I put the above said thing, enilanroc , in a
small iron  casket  on the fire of my
goldsmith 's forge  with three or four small
half-burnt coals , and blew only with my mouth . And,
however, the thing came to redden &  ignite & became
all white, not only on its surface but also inside, & at that time I
let it cool on its own near the fire , for otherwise, exposing
it suddenly to cold air, it would have burst. Once all white, I passed
it through my <add>lead </add> wheel of
tin  , where I found it as hard as before, & uncovering a
little white, I found it a fair carnation. Finally, I polished it &
saw that it took a very beautiful polish & could be compared to a
very beautiful agate  for cutting some beautiful face on it &
bringing it on the  a table of


 </div> 013r
<div> agate  of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in
a brick  of the exact size of the thing & put it inside. Then
I reddened two glassmaker 's solders , & as they
were red, I presented them one after the other onto the surface of the
thing until I got the white crust that I required, on which I made such
drawing as I wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a
diamond  point , and I polished it with
hog  bristles   and tripoli  . I do
not know if it would be better to reheat it under hot ashes ,
& if it would be good to encase it in alabaster , which is
very cold, as I encased it in the brick .
</div><div>Carnation from arsenic 
Sublimated arsenic , that is to say, the white one that is
sold as stone , when ground on marble  , mixed with
vermilion  or lake  or minium , makes a beautiful
flesh color that is always shiny. Yellow arsenic  has a very
beautiful color, the white one is good in oil  and agrees well
with the lake .

</div><div>Fine sieves of raw silk  
One makes tammy of raw silk  on a loom , to make

vapor that would hold the flour  & in the end would prevent it
from

passing through so well. But choose for that effect, yellow &
natural raw silk  because it is stronger & casts out flour 
like horse hair .
</div><div>To know the good azurite ash  for oil 
The one that piles up in small <corr>clods</corr> and is lumpy is
the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is also very
pale in color, because oil  darkens it. Certain
sophisticators  mix them, but you will know this if you pour
some onto a piece of paper  & lay it flat & smudge it with
the finger   since, if it is mixed, it will be found
variegated & as if with pale & darker stripes, but if it is
unmixed it will be even & of one color.

<div>For walls  of earth  and rustic
construction
Swallows  have taught us this craft, making their nests out
of mud  mixed with wisps  & stalks of hay or
straw  to make it bond. Therefore, in places where stone  &
brick  are lacking, one can use earth  to make partitions
& walls . And for this, light earth , which does not
form clumps when plowed, but which is somewhat intermixed with
arene  , holds first rank, because it can be beaten &
tamped down better. It is true that it needs to be moistened &
la   cut into clods with a ditch-spade , and
thus place & arrange it. This one lasts longer and does not require
as much effort, and ne   dryness does not make it
split & crack. But, because such kinds of earth  are not found
everywhere, those who are on good & fertile land , after
marking out with a measuring line  the width & length of
their foundations, drive into the ground  in along the
foundation edges, on this side & that, long poles &  or chevron beams  to support boards 
between which <corr>they</corr> throw the earth , making each
layer one foot   thick or thereabouts, intermixing it
with S.S.S -like branches of heather   or
similar things, then with beaters  of <corr>three</corr>
different forms they tamp it & beat it. One is called the
mallet , which has a triangular form like A, and with this, one
first tamps the earth . Next one uses the one made of blocks of
wood pointed at the tip & helved to a thick stick, & this one
is for pressing the earth  well at the extremities and edges of
the wall , which adhere to the boards , & is
called. The other one is called the bat , which is for
flattening & beating the earth  for the last time, as shown in
.C. Then one makes another layer of earth <add>&
heather  </add> and beats it as was said, & continues
thus until the wall  is complete, which one covers with
heather   & then with earth . Some
m   intermix the said wall  with rows of
bricks . They also make the wall  tapering, giving
a   width to the foundations according to how high one
wants to raise the wall . Which, when old, whitens, &
thereby shows that it has saltpeter  in it. That is why, when they
fall down, gunpowder makers  profit from them.

<div>Damasked cloth 
You can damask a cloth  with two different colors and imitate
embroidery without adding anything else to it, in this way. Once it is
dyed  yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you.
Then you will baste some string  or a thicker cord  onto the
pouncing and throw it into a dye  of guesde woad  
or pastel woad   & it will become green, except that
which is beneath the string , which will remain yellow because the
green dye  will not have penetrated there. And you can do thus
with other colors, and instead of cord  or string , add some
pieces of paltry cloth , cut into moresque shapes, on top of the
first color. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.
</div><div>Casting molten metals 
One casts candlesticks and small works in a frame  with
sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles the frame with
flour  in order to make the e metal  copper  or latten  run better. When the sand has been used
for a month , it is necessary to take some new sand, because the
one that was used, having been reheated in fire + , dries out & loses its ability to bond. However,
it is used to mix among the new sand, for it makes the work not so
porous. One casts large works such as artillery, bells & similar
things in earth , & copper  cast in earth  makes
less of a chappe , and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The
earth  is sandy clay  mixed with horse  dung 
& cloth  waste. The earth  that is  has been
used for casting, which is black, baked & as if burnt, is used to
cast, gecte   mixed with artificial sand , &
is very good. <add>To soften & make the copper  run, throw in,
once it is melted, a little lead , which does not form an alloy

</div><div>Casting gold  and silver 
The sand must be from something very dry & arid & reheated
well in the frame , because, if it were humid, like
founder 's sand , the gold  and silver 
would spatter, & cause damage. It is also necessary for the
earth  to absorb the metal , for cast gold  or
silver is  become very spongy. That is why it must be
beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon
handles.

<div>Fonte  of soft iron 
Most people  consider that iron , once melted,
cannot be melted again because they only heat it in small
forges , in which it only becomes red-hot. Alchemists 
undertake to melt it with realgar  or lead  or mixed
orpiment . But without all that, some have found a way to
the  melt not only brittle iron , such as the kind used
for iron  pots , but also soft iron  such as
d   that of pigs & ingots, which is the most
difficult kind. And to this effect they make a furnace  in this
manner which has a width of one pan  & a half  &
one pan  & a half  of  a depth of two
pans  . And the tuelle , which is the barrel
through  marked A through which the bellows' pipes enter, has
to be placed in the middle of the depth of the furnace  such
that there is one pan   of the mouth of the
furnace  above the tuelle  & one
pan   underneath.

Each pan   of the mouth of the square furnace 
contains one & a half quintal , & the
pan   of the round furnace  holds two
quintals .
 
The miners , to make the iron  run, put at the mouth of
the forge , two or three handfuls   of
wallwort   when they want to make the
fonte   run, and this renders the iron  wonderfully
ductile and flowy.
It is also necessary that the tuelle  enters through to the
middle of the mouth of thefurnace , which is a principal part of
the secret because the wind will hit the edge & the wall which makes
up the belly of the furnace  & by such means, it spreads
equally everywhere & above, like the flame in a reverberatory
furnace , & by such means heats much more; for if the wind were
to hit directly from above, the substance which is melted or ready to be
melted, it would cool it down & prevent it from running &
melting. It is also necessary for the bellows to be driven by the
falling & running of water  as in forges , because in
this manner, the bellows run with measure & compass & with great
speed, which the strength of workers  could d  not
do. Therefore one raises the wall as you see & the furnace 
on the surface of the ground at the edge of which you make a channel as
with other fontes  , to put the molds  of that
which you want to cast & to do this, you unstop the opening that you
had made at the bottom of the furnace  to make the melted
substance run. You will be able to melt two quintals  of

Some make a mould of the calibre  of the piece, & temper it,
then beat a soft iron  piece cut to size, & when this piece is
very red, they beat it into the mold  & round it off with a
large file , considering these balls to be stronger than the
melted ones which, being britlle, are more subject to breaking.

it is necessary that you have reheated your furnace with  with a little of the big charcoal , such that

charcoal  in the middle of which you will put your iron ,

will be swallowed &  at the bottom of thefurnace ,
always put in as much again. And add three or four shovels  of
new charcoal  which should be of the biggest kind and moistened,
in order that it may have more heat & and not be consumed too soon.
And when you see that your furnace  is full of substance, around
two quintals , or less if you don't have that much, you will
leave the charcoal  to be consumed by itself. And when the
charcoal  is more or less reduced down to the level of the
furnace , you will be able to pour into molds  &
iron  or metal  shells , which is even better
because one iron  attaches to the other. And it is necessary that
the inside of the mold  be well covered with wetted
ashes , in order that it does not adhere to it.

thread , which gives it more light & makes the wick hold up
straighter. Otherwise, if it is all of cotton , as those of

<div>On gunners 


The cannon fires at point blank from five to six hundred paces .
But not for breaching, for which good execution cannot be made except
from two hundred paces, or three hundred paces  at the most,
and should not be any farther. Its shot usually weighs 40 lb  of
the King's caliber. There is a fowler, which weighs xxv
quintals , which are small, short cannons. It is for fighting
the ditch casemates & for battering at close range. It bears large
shot of the King's caliber like the others, namely of 40 lb . It
bears in the breech only the width of two balls & a quarter of a
ball. The front only bears the width of one ball & a third of a
ball. Its charge is similar to those of bigger one, namely xx
lb . And for this reason, when one wants to try them, one ought
not to over-charge it, for this damages the piece. And for the first
time & until it has fired five or six pieces  shots, it is
better not to give its complete charge, for the piece is unproven. And
the test that one can do is to give it a charge of xx lb.  of
fine arquebus powder  instead of ordinary cannon powder .
And four good horses  are sufficient to carry it. They are easy,
& close up they have as much force as the big ones, especially for
private houses & small towns & fortresses of little importance.
They are no more subject to bursting than the others because they are
short. For that which gives great strength to the powder m &
to the piece the danger of bursting, is the length of the piece, because
the powder  is burned entirely before exiting, &
the  its impetuosity is held constrained for longer in a
small  long piece than a gr   short one. The
fowler is usually seven to eight pan  s long. It is true
that this is a pan  of Montpellier   & not a
King’s pan , which is not used in the founding of guns for
making them good. For the pan  of Montpellier  
being of  shorter, the cannons plus  
proportioned there are shorter also, &compensate in thickness
ce   the length that they would have by the King’s
pan  , by which measure they will be found longer. But
also they would be thinner. The great cannons  The strength of
the fowler for making a breach is 80 paces  .


The great cannon, because of the weight of its shot, carries a range of
only a thousand or xii hundred paces  without landing,
&bouncing, usually it bounces iii times.


The fowler does not have a large effect if not close.


One recognizes the good alloy of a piece by seeing it. For if, with the
greenness which they expel on the surface, they redden, that is to say
that they are composed of a sufficient quantity of rosette . If
not, they are only of metal , which shows up whitish. If they
themselves do not make this demonstration, scratch & you will see.



The good alloy for pieces is of three parts   of
rosette  & one of the fine metal  from a big bell, where
there is more rosette  than in the metal  of small bells.
The metal  usually costs xv lb  & fine rosette 
xv or xvi.


The pan   of Montpellier  is equivalent to six
of the King’s inches  , which contains in it two common.



It is necessary, for a  mounting a piece well, that it be as
high at the side of the mouth as at the breech. Otherwise, one does not
mount well.

<div> The large canon, which is for great batteries, usually weighs
fifty-five or lx quintal s. At the breech it carries the
thickness of b  two balls &l   a third
of one ball. At the front, it carries ba  the thickness of one
ball & two thirds. It is thirteen or fourteen
pan s long. But they are very troublesome to drive. The
head-on battery, to accomplish its task quickly is  &
batter with great force, is at d   one hundred fifty
paces & at two hundred. And  It is true that one batters
well from three or 4 hundred pace s, but it is necessary to give
it more powder . Its common load is of xx lb  of
powder , its ball of 40 lb . One needs xxv horses 
to drag it. When one fires it farther than its usual range, one puts in
a half ladle   of canon powder  more. A cannon can
be fired 4^(xx) or a hundred shots per day, but one needs to refresh it
every time after one has fired te  nine or ten shots, if the
battery is steadily used. For if there is a break, it is not necessary
to refresh it as often. For two quintal s of copper , or
two quintal s & a half if it is for large cannons, one puts
one quintal  of metal . The metal   is
composed at the beginning of eight lb  of tin  for one
quintal  of rosette  , while for big bells one
only puts six lb  of fine tin  for one quintal  of
rosette  , to give it a bigger voice. For the more
tin  there is, the clearer the sound is. Its  For gun
founding, if one provides the material & charcoal , as one
usually does, for master s do not have the means, one gives x
to xii lb  per quintal . And for the mat  when
the master  provides everything, one gives him 40 lb 
per quintal  for large pieces such as cannons, according to the
King's ordinance, and l lb  for small pieces.
T   For the more material there is, the more profit
the master  has of it. One founds another kind of fowlers of
xxx quintal s which are longer than the others, and easily eight
pan s  long, & they are for battering defenses &
casemates s  , placing them via trenches, at night, on
the edge of the ditch.
◯ 

On each side of the breech's opening they give the thickness of half a
ball. And then they also add on each side the third part of a ball.
Ain   one gives it two ladles   of
cannon powder  for its charge, & one & a half of arquebus
powder , & the same for the others.

The composition of French  cannons is of one quintal  of
metal for two of rosette  . But those of Toulouse 
& Poncet  puts iii of rosette   & one of
metal.
The rosette   for re-melting is more profitable than
cauldrons, which turn entirely into filth.


Old pieces are composed of almost de dem   as much one
as of the other, namely one part of rosette   & one of
metal. One recognises this composition with a burin . For its
substance is found to be sour & the particle taken from the
burin  is found to be mixed with yellow & white.

Big culverines are  for battery <add>& the false one</add>
are forty quintal s and eighteen pan  s long.
Their ball of the King's caliber  and battery weighs 30
pound s and is therefore lighter than the canon's one.
Therefore, It does not carry so many munitions because fifteen
pound s are enough for its load. The canon has a bigger mouth
due to the size of its cannonball, but the colverine is more precise and
goes faster, having greater range due to its length. Its breech is two
bullets and a third thick, the front is a bullet thick. Culverines are
used for fighting fortifications from far away when it is not possible
to easily approach them. And then canons come closer. They are used also
to support the battery. Fifteen or sixteen horses  are necessary
to carry it. They are made of the same metal alloy than the canon, like
all others smaller pieces of artillery . For these, we add a
little bit more metal in order to make the melting run better. And for
two quintal s of rosette , you add six unit of metal per
pound for smaller pieces. They range from 8 or 9 hundred pace s
to a thousand pace s if the powder  is strong and in the
air half a league .


Some invented loading cannons with cartouches.


Some don't fill the canon with powder  at once but twice and each
time ramming the powder  in, saying that each time you ram it, you
raise it and give an inch  more. But this is not sure for big
pieces for they are loaded with a lot of powder .


The bastarde  is a middle-sized piece of artillery 
which weighs thirty quintal s and its cannonballs weight 15
pound s and is loaded with 10 or 12 pound s of
powder . Its proportions are two cannonballs and a third part of a
third one thick at the breech and one cannonballs and three parts of two
at the front. They are used for fighting against less important defences
such as gabions or sentries, topped with a tower, or similar thing. It
is thirteen to fourteen pan  s long like the great
cannon. Ten horse s are necessary to carry it. It goes with the
culverine for shooting because it carries small munitions. 


Some make the breech three cannonballs thick and the front two
cannonballs.


The bastarde culverine  weights 35 quintal s and is 25
pan  s long. The breech is three cannonballs thick and
the front two cannonballs. Its cannonball is like the bastard one,
weighing 15 pound s. These are fixed pieces which cannot be
carried on a carriage. They are for city defences. Some make cannons
like these which are 27 or 28 pan  s long, like La
Rochelle 's vache , but such pieces are strengthened at the
breech with a width of three cannonballs. Their range is one
league  and a half. Its load is like the bastarde 's
one, and if one wants to hit horsemen  very far way, more
powder  is added. After the cannonball there is a trace of smoke
which drives your <corr>trajectory</corr> to where the cannonball is
going. This is understood for cannons and the culverine , but
not for small pieces.
 </div> 018v
<div> 

The average weights 18 quintal s  and is xii
pan s  long. Its cannonball weighs eight or 9 pounds and
its load is six pounds of powder . The breech is three cannonballs
thick and the front is two. It is more appropriate against cities'
defence rather than in battery. It is however sometimes used either to
break a barricade or to support the battery after cannons have shot, in
order to prevent the assailled from rebuilding after the cannons have
played and shot. Four horses  can carry it. It has a range of
eight or nine hundreds paces  and almost as many as the
bastarde.


To cannons and big pieces we give as much powder  as a cannonball
and a half's diameter in proportion to the escusson . For medium
pieces, such as campaign pieces, and the ones smaller, we provide them
with powder the equivalent of two cannonballs have a quantity of
powder  equivalent to two cannonballs thick in proportion to the
passevolant  and smaller ones are given three cannonballs thick
of powder . Usually, all pieces are loaded up to the escusson. We
load all pieces under 4 quintal s  with the
linstock , two linstock s  of cannon powder or
one and a half lantern of arquebus powder. For smaller ones, we only use
one linstock  . The pieces of one
quintal   as loaded with a little charge.


A battlefield piece weighs ten or twelve quintal s  and
is ten or 12 pan s  long. Its cannonball weights 6 or 7
pounds and its loaded is 4 pounds of powder . The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front is two, like all the pieces under the
mid-sized. The breech is thicker for they are in proportion longer and
also because they are more frequently used than big pieces against
houses or elsewhere. Their caliber is also small, so we give their
breech a thickness of three cannonballs. They are used to follow
immediately a camp and for the defence of cities and houses, settling
them on walls or in a tower. Three good horses  are required to
carry it.


The passevolant weighs 6 quintal s  and is eight or nine
pan s  long. Its cannonball weighs two pounds, and its
load is a pound and a half of powder . The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front two. Two horses  can carry it
because one single horse can't carry a piece. It is used for houses'
defence or to be brought amongst the infantry to break a horsemen
rank.


A faulconneau  weighs 4 quintal s  and is 10
pan s  long. Its cannonball weighs a pound and a
quarter, its load is half a pound of powder . The breech is three
cannonballs thick and the front two. To carry it, two horses ,
altough these pieces are seldom moved since they are manly used to
defend houses. The ones which are carried over for battery or a fight,
or a siege, are culverines, medium-sized bastardes and pieces

<div> 

of campaign. Faulconneau  is to commonly loaded with a
linstock . There are also some other faulconneaux 
weighing three quintal s , and which are nine
pan s  long. Their cannonball weighs half a pound. Their
load is a quarter pound of powder . They can be loaded with a
linstock , but more commonly they are loaded with a charge. The
breech is three cannonballs thick and the front two. The small pieces
which are under three quintal s  are at least three
cannonballs and a twelfth of a cannonball thick at the breech, and the
front thickness is sometimes reduced to get the proportion according to
the length.


The strength of the piece is at the level of the tourillon ,
where the lighted powder  starts.


The strength of the berche  is at the maslée , behind
the breech.




A double musket weighs 2 quintal s  and is seven
pan s  long. Its cannonball is a quarter of a pound or
less. The breech is three cannonballs thick, and the front two. It is
loaded with as much powder  as cannonballs, to the top of the
touch line, which is equivalent for such small pieces to 3 or 4 arquebus
powder  cannonballs, because if canon powder  is used, it
can be loaded five cannonballs high.


This has to be understood as iron  cannonballs. When a metal
cannonball is fired, we overload it with a quarter of
linstock   because if a cannonball weighs 40 pounds, a
metal one weights 60 pounds. This is why the sight is higher when a
metal cannonball is fired. Because if an iron  cannonball is fired
directly, a metal cannonball is shot from six lines higher. A metal
cannonball, mixed with copper  to make it more brittle, is more
effective at close range than the iron  one. But an iron 
one is more effective at long range. 


A simple musket weighs one quintal   and is six
pan s  long. We disregard the ones that are less than
two quintal s , and which usually throw lead cannonballs
by its weight, and concentrate on those  which are loaded by
caliber. However, those muskets  that can be loaded with metal or
iron  cannonballs will work better, for they will do more damage
than the lead ones . It is loaded up to the touch line, which is 4
cannonballs thick. 


Arquebus à croc weighs 60 pounds, the bigger one is five
panel s  long, it is loaded up to the touch line, which
is 4 cannonballs thick; it is loaded with lead  cannonballs, and
is for house's defence. These great and small arquebuses are used for to
make orgues , appropriate for an assault outside and inside.They
are casted separately in order to be used in various ways. See the 4th

It is necessary to have millet   pilled to remove the
husks  and then you will clean it well. Next it is necessary to
grind it again quite finely and pass it through a hair sieve 
quite finely. This done, it is necessary to mix the flour  with
melted fresh butter  and some milk , and that there be
as much of one as the other , so that it is very light in color,
like the dough to make fritters . And you will put in egg
yolks  according to the quantity of flour , so that it amounts
to two egg <corr>yolks</corr>  for each millas  .
Then you will put in some saffron  , if you like, to give
them a little color.
It is necessary, next, to have some molds , and it is
necessary that they be earthenware , in the shape of the crown of
a catholic hat, but it is necessary that they be open at both ends. And
then, having made a good fire, you will clean the place in the
hearth   where you want to put your
millas  , and then you will take your molds  and
grease them quite heavily so that the dough  does not stick when
cooked. Having done that, you will put your said molds  on the
well-cleaned place in the hearth   and will put a
little flour  at the bottom and fill them with the aforementioned
dough . Next you will cover the said molds  with
lids  which will be made like the molds , but it is
necessary that they be larger and not be open at the top. Then having

Glass from Lorraine   is smoother & more even than
plate glass  and it is sturdier & more durable. But commonly
it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens
because the glassmakers , having made it, put it when totally
hot on straw  , which stains it in this way. However, this
is removed with varnish  & salt  & other
drugs  that the glaziers  put in. Glass from
Lorraine   is sold by lien   & each
lien    is composed of three tablets .
The lien   costs usually x sous  .
Plate glass sold in  is made in France , it is
whiter & clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from
Lorraine . It is also commonly blown & in that case, it is
better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the
shape of the frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very
evenly.
Plate glass  is sold by paniers  . Every

<div>Cannoneer 
As for small cannons that are not loaded with a linstock, one loads
them with powder  all the way up to the touch hole, which is
placed at a point on the cannon that indicates the appropriate
measure.
To point a cannon, that is to say to fix the target, one needs to
set the sights, in other words, take aim, from the sides rather than the
top, that is to say the top of the cannon. By taking aim from the top,
you can find the line of fire that leads to your target, but you will
not find out if the cannon leans more to one side or the other. Then
take your sights first from one side and then from the other and adjust
your cannon to point at your intended target. Then set your sights from
the top of the breech, which will be quickly done. Next, use your
discretion to lower the cannon a little if you are within firing range,
because the force of the powder  blast usually raises the barrel.
If you are outside of the range in which the cannon can fire in a direct
line, you should consider that the weight of the cannonball will lower
the barrel.
</div><div>Shooting a cannon at night
Some keep their cannons loaded and in the daylight hours.
Then, so that the cannoneer  can shoot into the breach where
the <corr>besieged</corr> are perhaps reparing the breach , the
assailants raise a false alarm so that the besieged throw torches or
artificial fire  into the moats or around the breach, light by
which the cannoneer  can take aim. Sometimes by using the
reflection off mirrors  or jars  full of water ,
the assailants can redirect the light onto the breach. The method that
you know, using a sundial and lead  line, is also very good.
Others use strong iron  pegs to fix two or three planks onto a
platform of wood  made to carry a battery of cannon, and leave
some notches empty where the cannon wheels can pass perfectly. And with
this method you will always put the cannon in such a position so that it
doesn't tilt to the right or the left. And so that it isn't too high or
low when you fire the following day, you place a marker that is well
fixed in the ground, that just touches the bottom edge of the canon
after it has been aimed and adjusted for firing.
If the platform, the wheels or wedge
parts break or come loose, this invention holds no advantage.
 </div> 021v
<div> Others place two well-staked poles into the earth in such a way that
the one is as far from the edge of the cannon's mouth as the other. And
underneath they place the above-mentioned ruler. Then when want to fire
the cannon at night, they push their cannon straight towards the
above-mentioned ruler and make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on
the end of the aforesaid ruler. Next, they measure with a ruler, or a
similar tool with measured intervals, from one pole to the side of the
cannon and if it is too close or too far, they adjust the canon and make
it the same distance as from the other pole.
</div><div>Unspiking your cannon
Some people say that one should remove the cannonball if the cannon
is loaded and introduce fire into the mouth of the cannon. But it is
probable that the fire will leave again through the mouth rather than
seek its exit through the touch hole which is spiked and restricted. The
most reliable way is that the cannoneer , who is often a
founder , drive in a nail  and turn back the point of
the nail  that the enemies placed therein, and with a
trephine , make another touch hole at the side of the spiked
one, which can be done in an hour. And if with time the violence of the
powder  loosens the nail  that the cannon was spiked with,
you will make a nut in the second touchhole and place a screw  in
it, so perfectly that it will never come undone.
</div><div>Defense of a town
There is nothing more efficient for defending a breach than mortars
placed at the front line, as soon as the initial assault. They carry a
lot of ammunition and are filled with cart nails , big
steel  dice, bits of chains  and similar items. And when one
senses that the enemy is close, one lights everything on fire. Grenades,
well-constructed and thrown at the right moment, also cause much damage.
And to make them worse, one can add some roughly crushed glass ,
either in the mold or in the crucible, when one casts them. This worsens
the wounds. The grenades must not be too brittle, but it is good that
they be somewhat alloyed with the material of the grenade so that
instead of breaking up, they resist shock better and inflict more
violence.

 <div>Orgues
Then they are affustés on a rather thick board close to each other
and notches are made onto the board this way
 .

And through these notches is fit the harquebus’s hook which has a hole
through which we pass, from under, iron  pegs. When you want to
aim, you affuste the middle and side ones. If you want to make double,
triple or four ranks or more, you have to put similar board rank one on
the other, like the first one. This manner of making an orgue fait faute
@ and makes it very stable. Because the other ones made of one massive
and solid piece have cannons of only one and a half pan long. They
therefore are used only for a salvo at an entrance or to protect a
gate.


A small hooked harquebus a-crocke weighs 40 pounds  and is 4
pans   long, and is to be loaded to the touch hole, its
breech is three cannonballs thick, its front two.


The double cannon is nothing different from the big ordinary cannon,
apart from the fact that its cannonball has one line  of
thickness - or of diametre - more. A line  is a twelfth
part  of a cannonball. At the breech, it has a thickess of one
line  more than the cannon, and the mouth is half a
line  thicker. Its load is six or seven lbs  of
powder , more than a cannon, that is to say of two big linstocks.
Its cannonball weighs 56 lb . Thirty horses  are
necessary to carry it. It weakens the walls more than a cannon. But it
is very uneasy to drive. This is why it is unused today and is more
appropriate to be brought to a nearby place for close combat or for a
ceremonial  entry, rather than for an ordinary execution. They are
called basilics, and they are unmovable pieces.

<div>A mortar is made so that it weighs three quintals  and
carries a cannonball flat on the side from which it must exit and round
on the side of the cannon, as if it was a cannonball cut in half. It is
two pans long. It has to be loaded with xxv lb  of powder
because it has to be full to the opening and has to fire. Its bottom is
not thicker than the opening and is made of one single piece. Its
material has to be better than other artillery pieces, and for 4
quintals  of fine copper  there must only be one quintal
of metal  so that it absorbs the shock, and so that, when fired
with more force, it is more efficient. It has to be used against a door
with a large iron  cross before the bullet, and once loaded, needs
to be covered with a firmly sewed rough canvas  which should be
completely smeared with turpentine . Four handles need to be added
to it while it is cast, it <corr>is</corr> thus easier to place. The
iron  cross is fixed to the opening with the canvas 
covering it. The handles have to be held at its opening's edge, as you
can see. To place it, you need three or four iron pegs 
of one pan   long and as thick as a
finger  , which have their point like a gimlet ,
and their body like a screw as they are strongly pulled, and a ring on
the other side to turn them with a short stick  that fits into
the ring . And the pegs  are fixed on the door, not
straight, because they would not have any strength, but crooked as if
you wanted to fix them towards the middle of the mortar , and to
do the holes of the handles need to be quite large. In that way, the
shooting mortar  pushes the pegs  back and forth into the
door, and makes more damage. Once in place, you need to have
saucisse de buckram   @ made in this manner: take eight or
nine canes   of buckram   selvage or more
if the gap is larger, which have to be as large as four or five
fingers  , have it sewn in such a way so that it is like
an intestine where a stick  as thick as a
finger   can fit. Fill it completely with good


This one is to be put below an undermined tower with its opening towards
the top. One casts two large iron rings  and, with a
stick  or two, four men carry it. They are also used for placing
within wall breaches but just half a charge is necessary, that is x
lb , and fill the rest with some pebbles  and cart
stones 
.

 

It needs to be covered entirely with a waxed canvas  and
rubbed with turpentine  and other combustible things . This
cover is made to ensure that the bullet does not fall and so that, when
the cover is given fire, the powder  does not fail. Upon the fuse,
you will need to put a good quantity of powder . Some put on the
ball a cross of iron  which is longer than the mouth of the
mortar  by two pans  . Others only put the
ball.
 </div> 023v
<div>  powder . When the sausage is filled, dip it gently in two
parts vinegar  and one of spirits , to moisten the
canvas  but not the powder . Next, leave the aforesaid
canvas  to dry completely, and then you need to attach to the
sausage a long string  or cord twice as long as the
sausage , but you must not tie it to the sausage but make it touch
the two ends and sew it to the sausage in a few places in the middle.
Next you need to smear all of the sausage with very good
turpentine , and at one end, where you will want to join to the
mortar 's fuse for firing, you can sew or tightly attach with a
selvage of canvas  as large as one empan   which
should also be well soaked in turpentine , and this selvage should
be cut in the middle so that it can be fastened and wrapped around the
mortar , and you must attach it so that the tip of the sausage
that is open will be joined to the fuse of the mortar . Then you
need to place a lot of tightly-packed powder  onto the fuse of the
mortar . And next, the person outside of the ditch should draw the
small string  and cord  that is joined to the sausage so
that it is extended mid-way, but not so much that it is detached. And if
there is water  in the ditch, it will be necessary to support the
sausage with a fork. Then, having placed himself and others in safety,
the person who holds the tip of the sausage will be able to fire.
</div><div>Mortars  that one wants to fix on doors or iron  gates
are sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 lb . For the rest, for its
charge, cannonball, and process, you need to do all just as was already
said before concerning the one of 3 quintals  . One man
can carry it.
The cannonball needs to be be round on one side and flat on the
other like a half  of a cut cannonball. The cross also needs to
stick to the ball - the latter melting if it is made with metal  -
and is enveloped in the middle of the cross.
</div> 024r
<div>Grenades
Grenades should be made from the finest metal you can find, for
there is fine metal and rough metal. Fine metal is that of a big bell,
because one puts in more copper  to give it a bigger voice, &
for small bells one puts more tin  to give it a bigger 
clearer sound. The metal of a big bell is made with 3 quintals of
one rosette  & twenty or xxv lb. of tin .
Tan   Each grenade must weigh four to six lb. In order
to throw them, it is necessary that they be full of powder mixed with
coarsely pestled glass. And for a quarter lb. of powder, half an ounce
of glass is necessary which is put with it, in order that on the face or
places where the powder will have its effect, the wounds will be all the
worse for it. The best arquebus powder is required here. The hole needs
to be as large as the thickness of a swan's quill, & there is no
need to make it threaded, it is enough to make it even. Next, you make a
pipe of well-soldered fer blanc , which can enter into the hole
& enter into the middle of the grenade & which comes out of it
by the width of one finger. You will fill it with good powder, pestled
in a mortar & lightly mixed with good eau-de-vie  or strong
vinegar which seems. And when . This is done to compact
the powder. And to know if it will be slow enough to allow leisure to
throw the grenade without danger, try this powder thus bathed in another
pipe. You can keep d   your loaded grenades in a very
dry place, & on the contrary you shall keep your pipes filled with
that bathed powder compressed in a humid place. And nonetheless, you
shall have some already inserted into the  grenades, so that
you are always equipped. And every 3 days you shall change them if you
recognise that they have become too dry. To throw your grenade, take it
bravely &  in one hand & with the other give fire to
your pipe with the  a match, & throw it quickly amidst the
powder  troops. The thickness of the grenade should be twice
the back edge of a knife.<lb/>

<div>To bring a canon over land 


It requires a hundred roadworkers  or more to even gap tracks
and others obstacles such as trees , stone  piles and
similar things to make gabions on the road. Once one is close to the
battlefield, the gunner  goes at night to locate the most
convenient place to display the battery and if he does find one, a false
alarm should be raised so the ones inside throw torches. Very often,

you shoot as strong as possible so the assailed despising the battery do
not fix it. Usually, there are not many gun-turrets or other defenses.
And when a breach is made at the strongest and the cannon replaced, it
will surprise the assailed. One should approach fortified towns at
night, but  . The workers bring gabions and once these are
displayed, some boards or plank are put behind gabions to keep the
workers safe while behind, they fill the gabions with some earth 
by means of their shovels. And while this is being performed, another
false alarm is raised from another side. And once you have shot a cannon
ball at the defense, the gabions the workers  display the
boards to make a plain ground or a platform of four fingers or half a
foot thick. And they are set into the earth . The platform is five
or six feet larger than the cannon's wheels on each side if there is
just one cannon. But if there are more, platformes are side by side. The
space between the pieces is equivalent to the width of two gabions. As
long as the battery lasts, gunner s sleep and eat close to a
cannon. In small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach
the pieces but display many high gabions and run towards them. In large
places one digs trenches. There are always in trenches or behind
barricades units on guard duty to defend the pieces. A small
powder  container is kept containing three or four separate
cags.


You have to know the French containers for the artillery.


It is good if the platform is slightly oriented upwards because the
piece is more quickly put in action & tient plus coup  and
hits harder.
 </div><div>Lined cannons are those with a lining in the powder
container space. The bullet rolls only up to the opening of this
chamber. These ones are not so efficient and are not easy to load but
they do not light up so quickly.
</div><div>Steel  touch-hole is to be put as an anchor in the
canons so it will not be damaged during the shooting unlike the others
very quickly did. But these anchors are prone to jump off and injure the
canonner. The only thing is to use an appropriate touch-hole.
</div><div>A touch-hole at the bottom level is the best. That way the
cannon does not come backwards.
</div> 025r
<div> a hundred feet away from the battery and should be surrounded with
barricades or trenches. And this is where they go and get powder 
in bags or baskets. And each piece has its own basket to it three or
four times. Then, when the cannon is placed on the platform, one puts an
arquebus bulletproof board between two gabions. Then, with a lantern, a
gunner  reloads it, and with the ramer which is at the other
end of the lantern, two men press as hard as they can, nine of ten
pushes, until the powder  is dense Then another one adds some
hay  or straw  and the others ram for a while. Another one
loads the cannon ball. And the one with the hay  adds the same
amount and presses again. Another one adds a wood  hung but this
might damage the piece. And if one has to shoot a lot, one would need
many hungs which are heavy to bring. When the cannon is loaded, xx or
xxv workers  push it forward with the sticks by the side,
behind the gabions without taking off the board until the cannon reaches
it. Once the cannon is forward, the gunner  adjusts it with
the hooks at the back, pointing at the target on each side and then in
the middle.Then another one nearby sets fire. Each gunner 
needs 3 cannoners : one to load, one to point at the target
and one to set fire. Sometimes, against a camp where breaches are made,
one shoots a cartridges, as you find elsewhere, or one may use a basket
full of stones , cars' nails  or similar things. A cannon
must not be carried unless it is with two wood  or iron 
carriages. And you need seven quintals and a half of iron  to fill
the cannon's wheels, flasques and other equipage. The best battery is,
according to some people, made as a curtain which sideways, because by
doing so you unsettle more stones.
---------------------------------------- 

Some add small wheels to a piece and a thick board to the end of the
piece so it can be moved quicker and without noise. Others add some
leather around the wheels and also add soles or leather shoes to the
horses' hooves so they cannot be heard.
</div> 025v
<div>Gunner
There are three rings on a cannon, one at the breech, one in the
middle, one at the mouth. When founders want to work on their piece or
have a cannon or another lighter piece and easier to carry, they make it
from the breech ring to the middle one in the same size and proportions
as the bullets described below. But they taper it more or less one line
on each side from the middle ring to the mouth ring, always using a
compass for their measures from the straight line which they draw in the
modelle en papier    whatever pattern. And this
reduction is consequently equivalent to seven or eight quintals 
less. And this does not make the piece less secure. This is done for big
pieces, but for pieces smaller than the mid-one, one has to keep the
aforesaid proportion and make the piece in one straight line from one
end to the other. Usually the trunnions are situated one foot away from
the middle ring in the direction of the breech.

But since some gunners prefer a piece heavier at the front for it is
easier to adjust and for that purpose, it is sufficient to place the
trunnions closer to the breech and further away from the middle. On the
contrary if you want to make it heavier at the bottom, you will place
the trunnions

closer to the middle of the piece or forward in direction of the mouth.
When you drill your piece make a fluted cast iron  bar like a bed
poster and and there must be sixteen flutes or notches in which you will
fix sixteen well-even blades, so altogether they will cut and scrape
similarly. Because should some not cut or scrape, there would be some
waves and spaces in the cannon which would be bent and the piece might
break in its middle. In order to avoid this the drill has to go evenly
from the breech to the mouth and the piece's mouth must be evenly hard
so the powder  will be released at once with more strength. On the
contrary, if it is blocked it goes sideways and makes the piece
break.
</div> 026r
<div>This is the right measure of the caliber, but the drill always rubs
a bit more off. 
Cannon ball   </div><div>Mortar
They are better when shaped as the crucible with a narrow bottom and
a larger mouth. You have to strongly crush the powder and add either
some sand or some cork  or even better a pure pierced wax
plate  because it seals well up and is more efficient. A bullet just
makes a hole, the powder  only is more efficient. One knows that
they are stronger when kept in a dry place for fifteen days.

<div>Pewterers 
They deem the best tin  is the one that comes in
saulmons , which has not been remelted since it came from the
mine , because the masters remelt it a  in
grilles  , weighing two or three lb , to easily
cut it up and sell it by the piece. And in this they often mix in
leftovers from plates , soldering  & common tin .
And to recognise the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks
burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their
saulmons  they find pieces of iron , stones, & similar
things mixed in, to cheat on the weight. The tin from
England   is so hard that the miners  put in
lead  to soften it. The one that comes by way of Germany 
is softer. Usually, the sworn master pewterers , from
bonnes villes  , add six lb  of fine
lead on  or eight on a quintal  of fine
tin . The others, who work in the countryside  ,
put fifteen or 20 or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness
of the lead they  and its softness, they put in
looking-glass tin , 4 lb  per quintal ,
+ , po   which whitens & hardens,
and a little  six or eight lb  of rosette  on a
quintal to render the plate sonorous . 


To mold platters & dishes, they make them out of pierre
porte   morte  , that is from
grais  , & they shape &polish around 
them on the wheel . They melt their tin  in an
dest  iron  posnet  on a
charcoal  fire, and with an iron  spoon  that holds
almost  a sufficient quantity for a platter, they cast
leu   in their cold molds , which they keep
joined & tight between their knees . And soon after, they
open the molds  so that they do not heat up, & having taken
out the cast which is on the female side, & which breaks easily.
Then, with a cloth  which soaks in water , which they
always have beside them, they rub the middle of the back of the dish
& around the edge, so that it comes out better, and they rub the
female mold.
+ 

When the tin is fine , one adds less glass-looking tin ,
namely 4 lb  per quintal , but if the tin is low
quality , that is to say allied with a lot of lead , one puts
at least five or six lb  of looking-glass tin  to it.


If there is not a lot of looking-glass tin , one puts about two or
three lb  per quintal . One puts eight lb  of
rosette . But if there is a lot of looking-glass tin one , like 4 or 5 lb , one only puts six of
rosette . And commonly, per quintal  of tin , one
adds x lb  of both.

<div>Stucco  for molding
Take tragacanth gum  and put it to soak until, having drunk
its water , it is swollen & rendered like jelly . Then
crush it quite hard on the marble   & next take
rye  flour , which is better than wheat  
because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and
sprinkle your tragacanth gum  with it, & continue to grind
<add>and mix in</add> thus, little by little, le et mesler
legi   the very finely sieved flour . And knead it as if
you wanted to make bread , until you  you perceive that
it has enough body & is as firm as bread dough  that one is
ready to put in the oven . This is perceivable when it can
stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it
would not sti   release well. Thus once prepared, rub
the cavity au u   with oil , with a
brush , so that the oil  penetrates everywhere to make it
release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does
not release well, mix in more flour  until it has enough body.
With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which
will be dry within one day . Next, you will apply them with
strong glue  or paste glue , as you like, and you will be
able to paint and decorate them with gold  & all colors. One
makes ceiling ornaments with it in Rome . One can make bed
ornaments with it. If you want that the work stays white , it
is better to mold with plaster  instead of flour . It is
true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare
it like this: temper it, when it is powdered strong , in a
good amount of water  so that it is <add>clear</add>, & grind
it several times a day for fifteen days . Then pour off the
water  by tilting, and gather the plaster  & grind it
finely on the marble  , & place it in some kind of
clean lead  vessel , so that no dust & dirt falls into
it, & leave it in the open air  & au
serain   for fifteen days  with its water , and
it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making
a groundlayer for burnished gold . And this, in powder form, you
can mix, instead of flour , with tragacanth gum , and your
work will be very beautiful. Lacking plaster , you can mix in well
ground chalk  or ceruse , & try bole  &
similar things. This stucco  with the tragacanth gum  has
the quality, being malleable before being dry, of fitting on either
round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little
expense.


Flour  is not good in this, but chalk  or ceruse  is.

more beautiful & better it will be & it will dissolve if it is
good, otherwise it will become like lees . When you want to use
it, make a small hole in the stopper of the bottle  & pour a
little & stop it again each time, then apply it on gold .
The good kind of dragon 's blood  can be found in
large pieces like torteau <add>this one has no value and is
adulterated</add> & once broken it shows on its edges scales,
transparent as ro  rouge clair enamel , it is
also lumpy in some parts like small rubies . The eau de

The darker dragon 's blood  is the best & has more of
a tint; the tear is found in gr   pieces like
peas   and large hazelnuts   which look like

 


I put it in common eau de vie  , mixing in some
aqua fortis   to give it strength. At the beginning the
water  took on a slight tint, but at the end there was only an
appearance of tragacanth gum  with which I think they adulterate
the dragon 's blood .


When it is applied on burnished gold , it is prone to break. For

esgrusouer   by hand  s   towards the edge of the round cavity, & gently
guide it to the center of the circle. And this
desgrusouer   is for removing the first rough &
lumpy skins of the work. And next they even it out with a cutting
iron   called a plane  , on which they rub the
sharp edge with a little putty , on leather nailed 
onto a piece of wood having , and this, in such a way
that the flesh or grain is on the outside, for if the sharp edge of this
plane   was not thus rubbed & burnished, it would
not polish & not burnish the tin ,
au   which would stay white, & not black &
polished like a mirror. Moreover, they repair the work for the second
time with this plane   as they did with the
esgrusouer  . Then, with a knife  or another
sharp iron  , they scrape the edges of the plates or
dishes to smooth them so that they are not found sharp when handled

they put it in dye  and commonly make it in three colors, green,
red, and sometimes violet. The green one is made in pastel 
woad dye  only, because green being made from yellow and blue, the
pastel  woad  discharging itself onto the straw ,
which shows its dark yellow, one obtains bright green. For the red, they
use alum  and brazilwood  . For the violet, they use
pastel  woad  & a little copperas , which
darkens the blue with its black dye .

They have no invention for making a perfect red in a work, so that
one needs to reheat it. However try the German 
red  , which is rouge d'escaille . They make their common
red with some sanguine , looking-glass tin , rock
pieces , litharge  & a bit of scales of iron . The
said red saturates one side & the other of the glass  in order
that it has more color, if it saturated only one side it would be very
pale orange.

They pay xx lb  for a quintal  of rosette ,
which is harder to melt than latten  because it is softer. For,
the softer the <add>great</add> metals <add># </add> are, the soft  harder they are
to melt. The tin used to make bells , which is fine tin is more  and which is brittle, is easier to melt than lead,
which is soft . Latten, made brittle by the calamine   is
melted more quickly than red copper . The metal, which is the
substance of bells , mixed with tin , and very brittle, is soon
melted. The more silver  is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is
why solder  is made with it. In Germany  they make very
light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of
water , but they are breakable. A quintal  of

& the side    A, is hidden inside its handle 
marked C as readily as the side B. The two tenons you see at the tip of
the knife  are for locking it on one side or the other against a
nail  which is at the butt of the aforesaid handle , so
that when one wants to press hard <add>on</add> something in order to
cut it, it does not come out from the handle . You may allow the
side marked B to cut for demonstration purposes, <add>but not
much</add>, but the side that is notched A  and marked A must
not cut. It  It is sufficient that it be furbished well. And
also the notch needs to be as thick as the back of a

the wine  or cast it aside or let it flow through the tip, but
before, you must have pressed your thumb  well over the hole on
the top edge, because in this way, by the compression of air , the

One says that in Lorraine  & in Flanders 
well-made glass  is made of fern  ashes  &
pebbles , and first they blow up a long still, which another
worker, with long shears, cleaves & cuts lengthwise. Then, having
set this long, cleaved still on a stone   or large
platine  that is in the furnace , a little less warm
than the fonte , it is left to expand. And again in addition to
this, they flatten it with a large & long round iron 
stick , then they put it back in the furnace  to reheat. It
is made in the same way in England  more beautifully. Near
Rouen  in France , plate glass  is made with some
saltworth   & pebbles , that is whiter &
more delicate than that of Lorraine . For plate glass  can
be melted with a candle  & not that from Lorraine .
That of plate  is blown in a long still, which someone else cuts
at the tip, then the blower, while turning it & while touching it to
a plane  that is on the ground, flattens it, then puts it to
reheat. Thus the middle where it begins still remains.
The glass  can be remelted with
the light of a candle  when wet, but not as evenly as with the
hot iron  .

The metal  whitens the more it is melted, because the
tin  does not go away but rather mixes in more. And, by holding it
a long time in the fire, the filth  is eaten away, which makes it

copper , after it is well hot, throw in saltpeter  often.
This only & not the fire separates it, & purifies it, & eats

Some do not saturate the glass  with gris d'escaille  for
working as primer, but trace on the clean glass  with noir à
huile . But it is very necessary that the wood  be rid of
grease, because if it has even a bit of grease , the color will
not take on it at all. And further, if the glassmaker  who is
working has a stench  from his nose  or his
mouth , & he breathes  on the glass , the
color will not take on it. Those who discovered the invention of working
in small works of supple enamels  use only esmail
d'azur  , which is blue, & esmail colombin , which is
the color of purple, which they make supple with rock pieces  or
leaded glass . As for the yellow, they make it from silver ,
the red from sanguine , as is said elsewhere, the black & gray
& shadows with the noir d'escaille  , either strong or
weak, the carnation with the light sanguine . The green is made
first from yellow, then on top they coat esmail d'azur  ,

It is cut with a file , then one passes a certain pulverized

without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one side &
the other, &to show their naivete. I have a white one that seems to
be rough & pierced, and is spotted all over with blue blemishes. I

emery , they cut it in bevel & polish it. And in this manner,
they counterfeit very beautiful sapphires . The old esmail

</div><div>Amber 
The orangeish color that is in transparent amber  and in the
other one that has body is not internal, for on the inside it is
whitish. But through age it  or wearing it, it acquires this
reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the file  or on
the wheel  do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But
they only polish it, rubbing it with a willow  
stick  or other soft wood  dipped into water  &
dusted with tripoli of Brittany   , and it takes a
beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow & you want to intensify
its color, hang it inside a chimney  where there is much
soot  & smoke , and it will take on a reddish-orange
color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under
dung  to turn it green, like bones . Or smoke  it
in a closed space , in the smoke of safre   or
manganese  & other drugs  that you know. Or in
urine  & distilled vinegar  mixed with colors, or in the
vapor of aqua fortis   boiling in copper , or
aqua fortis   boiling with silver  & sal
ammoniac   & Some cut amber  in facets on a wheel
of soft wood   with potée   instead of
emery , & jet  also. The salt called de Langlois

lead , which refines the gold  & softens it, for the
saltpeter  would make it brittle, which silver  does not do.
This is why, to save money, goldsmiths  use it to assemble, in
order to spare borax , which costs viii sols   per
ounce , & saltpeter  x sols   per
lb .
When goldsmiths  have thus assembled their silver

It is grown in Lauragais where the deep soil is so
fertile  that if wheat  was grown there every
year  , it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why
one alternately does pastel  woad  and wheat 
there. For the cultivation of pastel  woad , one works
the soil with iron  shovels , as gardeners  do.
Next, one harrows it with rakes , & breaks it up finely as
for sowing cooking herbs . One commonly sows it on
Saint Anthony 's day in January . One makes eight harvests
of it. The first ones are better. The best pastel  woad 
of Lauragais  is the one from Carmail  & the one
from Auragne . And sometimes the pastel  woad 
is good in one field & in the one close by it  will hardly
have worth. The goodness of the pastel  woad  is known
when, put in the mouth , it gives a taste as of
vinegar  , or when crumbling & breaking it, it has some
mold-like veins which are as if golden or silver. One assays it in the
dyers ' vat , and to fill a vat  with it, one
needs six balls  of it. One dyes several locks  of
wool , and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be fifteen
florins , if it gives xx dyings, xx florins . The good

the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, & having cleaned
the glass  well with lye  & ash  so that it is not
greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with noir à
huile   or noir d’escaille   with the
pinceau  , if you want to paint with colors in the
manner of glaziers , who wash their glass pane  with
noir d’escaille   & then scrape & clear the parts
which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for
shading. But if you want to make gilt  histories on glass 
with a background of colors, which imitates the basse-taille  of
goldsmiths , gild  your entire glass pane  with
gum water  or garlic  juice  or fig-tree 
milk . Then moisten your printed history between two wet
linen  cloths  , and lay it down on the gilt
glass . Then with a pin  mounted on the end of a small
stick , follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to
pounce it, & thus you shall exactly trace it on the gilding of
the glass . & next you shall clear the background & that
which needs to be blank with a quite pointy steel  awl ,
& and neatly follow once more the lines & accomplish your work
& fashion your faces & flesh tones in pounded silver ;
then you shall fill the background with azur d’esmail   or
verdigris  or fine laque platte  platte   tempered with clear turpentine , mixed
with a little of tear of mastic  if you want that the colors hold
together more & not to spread. Next, layer on the back of the
glass  & over the colors a white tin  sheet. And once
this is dry, you can cover the tin  sheet of  with color
to hide your secret. The tin  sheet gives light to the colors.
Thus you will be able to paint without being
 </div> 040r
<div> being at all expert in painting. If your glass  pane is
bulging as if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When
you apply your turpentine  colors to your glass  panes,
first place them on a hot tile &, once they are hot, spread your
colors & leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your tin 
sheet.
</div><div>Dye 
Some take the root of lapathium acutum
maius   , which seems to be monk ’s
rhubarb   or sorrel  , & with the root, which
is yellow in the summer , they dye thread  &
similar things.
</div><div>Aquafortis 
Some put on <add>for</add> four pounds  of
substance ofaquafortis four  which are in the
retort  four ounces  of common water  in the
receptacle , which is better than putting it into the
retort . One de-phlegms & calcines alum  in order that
the water  does not have as much dregs. Several make it without
de-phlegming the alum .
</div><div>Vinegar 
One takes for granted that the mineral salt  that looks like
marble  & is called Cardona  salt  in
Catalonia  & at the border of Spain , thr 
when one heats it red-hot & throws it in the  all red or
quite hot into wine , it turns it into very good vinegar .
Some make it with water  poured on pomace soured  after
being pressed by vintagers , but it does not keep, &
spoils in heat & thunder storms .
</div><div>Buttons of vermeilles  
Because vermeilles   do not fear fire, one cuts them
into lozenges flat   on one side, then one joins them
together in a star shape in a paste of ground enamel , next one
melts it & one gilds  the enamel  with gold leaf 
which one reheats.
</div><div>Grottos 
To fill some empty place that cannot be laden with some sort of
hanging rocks, one puts a piece of thick parchment  close to the

<div>Cross of the commanders of Malta  
This beautiful rouge clair   which makes the field of

dragon 's blood  tempered with eau de vie  
or else Indian  laque plate , which in my opinion is made
in Flanders , tempered with clear turpentine  & tear
of mastic  & laid down on a silver  leaf, not the kind
which the painters  use, but a thicker kind, which is
burnished by those who make foil backings for gemstones Av   or by goldsmiths , & that gives it
this beautiful brilliance.
</div><div>Latten  and calamine 
Founders  do not melt latten  in a

</div><div>Aquafortis 
If your retort  is well luted one ought not to surround it
with ashes  , which would only get in the way of chasing
the spirits  properly. But when, at the end, you give it violent
fire, surround it with coals which should be lit elsewhere beforehand,
as those in the furnace  should be, in order that they do not
crackle & do not make smoke. Put the said lit coals around the body
of the retort , & not close to the neck, which does not need
to be heated as vigorously. The top grate , where you place your
retort , is sufficiently far, one dour   or
half a foot  , from the bottom grate  where the
charcoal is placed, for by doing this not as much of it is
wasted.

<div>Earth for casting, for founders  
It renders itself fat once beaten and also mixed with
horse  dung . Potter 's earth  would be
too fat and would crack & would not hold in the fire, but one needs
to mix it with half the quantity  of sand and a quarter 
or a fifth  of <add>horse </add> dung . And leave
it to dry, then powder it, then sift  it to render it fine &
cleansed, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The dung 
renders the earth  more amenable & easier to deal with, but it
is necessary that it be well free of straw  & other things.
And when the earth  is very fat, one needs to give it more sand
& more dung . But one does find fat varieties of earth ,
themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, make them so artificially.
One always needs to reheat the earths  before casting.
</div><div>Garden lilly 
If one breaks it at its first blossom & it will grow & bloom
only in the following year  , & know the
bulbous plants  do thus.
</div><div>Sand
The sand chosen cast  for casting should be neither so
lean that it has no stickiness, nor too fat. And even if it is found
in nature  , however, it is not everywhere. And if you
are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with
fat earth , for the sand does not want any of that, for it makes
it very porous. But you can make it bindable with brick well
ground  on marble  , or plaster  or calcinated
alabaster  or something similar, or the burned marrow of
ox  horn  or burned asphalt . If you grind it quite
finely on porphyry  , it s   acquires
stickiness better & then you can burn it with asphalt  or mix
it with a quarter part  of tripoli . Guard against
bread  falling into your sand because it makes it very
porous.


Try mixing in soot black .
</div><div>Ducks 
Young domestic ones do not grow for a month  
after they are hatched, but remain in this state. But after they quickly
grow, similarly if they go into the water. One feeds them with boiled
millet   grains , crumbling them among bread 
and spreading in well chopped lettuces  .

Iron scale  taken from bars that have been in the fire for a

described elsewhere, some add d   a little
minium  to it.


</div><div>Sheared ewes 
If the shearer  sometimes wounds them, he puts
   the dung of the ewe   on top. When they
are fat, they are easier to shear & do not get wounded so easily.




If the shearer  wants to viscorter  them, that is to
say castrate, when they are one or two years   old, he
must not have been with his wife for this would make the sheep 
die.
</div><div>Colors and gilding  on glass 
One ought not to give as strong gum water  on glass  for
the gold  layer as for silver  layer as for the
gold  layer because a silver  leaf is twice as strong as a
gold  leaf. Also, silver  is harder and therefore does not
scratch as easily. Q   And if the gum  was not a
little strong for the silver , the latter would not crack so
neatly. When you work, the humid  the exhalation of your
breath  moistens the leaf layered on the glass , &
therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times.
You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank
& serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not
quite clean of the gum 's greasiness & viscosity,
the  & of other things, the colors would not be so brisk
on it. To advance your works, you can ponce , or, better still,
layer the gum  & leaf on a cut paper . In this way, you
will need to repair very little. If you want to make gold  color
there without gold , mix soaked dried saffron  with a little
massicot .

The mould of earth   is reheated until sometimes it
becomes red hot, for otherwise the metal  would spatter &

</div><div>Wax  for seal and imprint
For the large wax  seals, one needs to have tepid water 
always ready & apre   to keep your wax  in
it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your hands 
to render it very even, for otherwise the water  that would get in
between would prevent it from coming together. Next you will imprint
whatever you want and put three or four pieces of paper  on, &
with a stick you  even & round like a
pestle , you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
will attach itself to the paper , which will help you lift it off
the mold . Thus you will imprint better than if you dripped it
molten. You can carve the figures & gild them, silver them, &
paint them with colors in varnish , & transfer them onto a
base of glass  painted with colors in turpentine &
mastic . And if you want to apply these plates by inlaying, do it
with gum ammoniac   mixed with vinegar , and you will have
good glue .
</div><div>For casting in plaster 
Melt some wax , & with a large brush , coat the
relief of which you want to have the cavity, as if you wanted to paint
it. And a light crust upon which qu   will be formed,
upon which you will cast you plaster , to give it body
and strength. Next, in the wax  cavity, you will also cast your
plaster  in order to have your relief, & it will come out very
easily, thanks to the wax . This is done more often for large
pieces in high relief than for others.

Next, to use it, apply soot black  with the glue  that
painters  use to paint, &  two or three times,

</div><div>Arquebusier 
For shooting your arquebus precisely, it is necessary that the end
of the breech be & come precisely on the edge of the touch-hole,
because in this manner the powder  catches & burns all at once
without blowing & has more force & does not push back. On the
contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the
powder  catches sooner in this place, makes it push back, and
blows, which a chambered arquebus clearly shows, because it pushes back
more than another. And since the barrel is bigger at the breech than at
the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for that at the breech is higher
than that at the muzzle. And then, the thickness of the barrel is
greater than the caliber by about one line, and the sight by another. It
would therefore be necessary to either make the cannon all of one size
or to raise the barrel from the end & towards the muzzle, & push
it in and lower towards the breech. The weight of the powder  must
be one third of the weight of the  bullet.


</div><div>Hail shot for the arquebus
If you want that it stays together put a piece of felt  or
leather  or paper  on it, depending on the distance, and let
the piece be made with a form precisely cut depending on the caliber of

thumbs and a few lines, which is the Paris aulne. The medium arquebus,
which is the usual one and the easiest, has xv pennyweight of
bullet , v pennyweight of powder  & a range of lx
paces.

<div>Loading a pellet  arquebus
 It is necessary to make a wooden  pipe 4 or 5 fingers wide
that is perfectly hollow, according to the open end of your barrel, of
the form represented in A. Then, having cut some paper , which has
to be as strong as that of large printed books, in the form indicated in
D and as wide as you want your cartridge to be long, wrap the
paper  around the baton B and at the top, where the pointed tip F
will be around the aforementioned paper , and the cartridge will
be formed. But, in order to make the bottom more uniform, put it into
pipe A, then introduce baton B and, in the other end of the pipe, which
is marked G, insert baton C and pack so as to compact and press the
folded tip of your cartridge, then take it out, and the charge in this,
put three or four drageons or larmes. Then, with a punch, marked E, of
the same caliber of your arquebus or pistol, punch round pieces on
cardboard  or felt  or waxed cloth , and put this
round piece into your cartridge, and push it until the drageons with the
baton B, the more drageons, 3 or 4, then a round piece. And continue
like that until the cartridge is full, the put it into the arquebus. If
you want your pellet to scatter earlier, make round pieces out of
paper . If you want it to reach further without scattering, make
the piece out of cardboard . If you want it to reach even further,
make the round piece out of waxed cloth , or either of
leather  or felt , and a piece of waxed cloth  on the
top. And if you make the cartridge in part with waxed cloth  or
waxed paper , it will reach one hundred paces and will make a big
hole, and the pellet , barely scattering, will produce a big
opening. But if you make your cartridge with waxed cloth  or a
material stronger than paper , it cannot be so long, with the
cardboard  tip being like in D, because it is enough if it wrapped
around twice. In such a way, the pellet  barely scatters and makes
a big hole in porte-corps armor or others.

You must have different charges depending to the range that you want

the nut of the the said arquebus' ramrod. So when you put the powder in
the charge, which is in the nut, hold the ramrod upright. And raising
your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the charge is in the
bottom of the arquebus, then straighten the arquebus, the mouth of the
barrel up, and remove the ramrod. That way, your powder will now be
entirely in the breech without any grain or dust that lines the sides of
the arquebus, which always has some grime in the chamber. That way it
will not recoil, and you will shoot more true.

basins, the latten  of larger ones is more brittle than that of
skillets, because in order to make the round shape so small it is
necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, that have a more
ample round shape, the substance can be more brittle. In any event, the
most brittle latten  runs better, & casts more neatly, but it
must be cast very neat  hot. One  When one wants to

<div>Extraction of regulus 
Take one lb  of antimony , half a lb black
soap , and half a lb  of tartar from
Montpellier  . Once the whole is pulverized, one needs to
boil in a varnished earthenware pot  on a big fire while
stirring the whole often with a pick of wood  or
iron  , & the said soap  will be consumed and burn
off and the rest will stay more or less red, and it will be necessary
that it is reduced by a third . Then one needs to throw it on a
tile  and it will turn blackish. One will need to melt this four
or five times and pour it on the flat tile  and then you will
have the regulus  drawn from antimony .
Others pulverize the antimony  & mix it with
saltpeter  &pulverized tartar , as much of one as of
the other , &, having heated a pot  or crucible 
red hot, they put a little of it at a time, & se  
turn their back  for fear of the smoke, and continue thus until
everything is put in, and strengthen the fire until everything is
thoroughly melted & melt it again several times.
</div><div>Lead , tin 
They become brittle having been put back to melt, often or for a
long time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one
melts a saulmon , the tin  thickens at the bottom if,
while casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to
melt a little lead & the  or tin  &
remuer   to renew at each melting. The antimony 
renders them breakable. The looking glass tin  whitens them.
One Pewterers  put in on the fine
tin   one lb  of looking glass tin  per one
quintal  of fine tin  & two lb  & a half
or three lb  of red & soft copper of cauldrons , which
is better than latten.  There is fine & soft tin  &
brittle tin . The brittle one is cast in grille  
by the pewterers  to sell it better. O  
They come out better & more neatly in stone  moulds 
than in a copper  mold , because copper  is fat
& sticks unless one heats the mold  well or one casts large
works. Three quarters  of lead  per one lb  of
soft tin , makes a very liquid line & proper for casting,
which has a shine like a mirror. Sandever  lightens them. All
things that lighten well metals  & remove their thickness
& dense nature & render them like  liquid like
water , render them proper for casting, for it is the thickness
that prevents them from running. Soft tin  is more even
com   than the brittle one , which is whiter and
seems to be burnished like a mirror.

To alloy well tin  & lead , one needs to melt one by
itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it
often on the marble   or the square tile  .
And when you will see it become well even like  & shiny as
if it were burnished, it is good. Because sometimes it becomes spotted
due to too much lead  & sometimes due to too much tin .
There is some tin  that has more lead  than others.
Common tin  is the one that is mixed with lead .

p half tin  and half lead , but
the first mixture is the best, & does not become porous. One needs
to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke
their molds  with a resin candle  to cast neatly. The
antimony  makes the substance brittle & breakable. The
looking-glass tin  makes the work whiter, but not more runny, as
for tin , it is good to the  with pure lead .
Those who make very neat lead  casts, use bodkins .

<div>Birds 
Calandra larks  & all birds  taken from the nest
& which have not had freedom are better, for these which are taken
by net never sing so well. However, the savage ones give
   much pleasure with their chanting, but they ought be
taken before Michaelmas  , otherwise they scarcely
live. A small impostume occurs on all on the fork of their tail,
occasionally, which some call gaillardise , which makes them
sick & sometimes makes them die, especially calandra larks .
One knows when they are sad & do not sing. One must pierce it
av  , not with a pin , but very gently by
turning with the tip of quite pointy feather . The calandra
lark  does not want to be without grey  river sand, &
the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself & cleanses
itself with it.


</div><div>Grain of lead 
Take a pierced playing card , pierced with a
pin  or needle , folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small split stick  and, holding the said
stick  by theun bout  <add>other</add> end,
put your card  three or 4 fingers   away from
the water  that you will have put in a dish  or similar
vessel . Then pour your lead , which should not be too
hot, into the card  & continually tap on the stick 
that holds it. And thus your lead  will turn into round grains.
And pass it through a large sieve  to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The larger one will reach 25 to 30 paces .

Those that can  are taken at Michaelmas  are
good for keeping, but those that are taken in March  die,
because they are starting to enter into love. Bénaris  
are fed oats all summer  in order that they are fed without
fattening, to be more appropriate for hunting & taking the others.
Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them
millet  . They sing at night . One needs to
c   take them after mid-July until
Michaelmas  , for after that time that they have their young in
this country, they go like the turtledoves . Siskins 
should also be taken from All Saints' Day until

receiving cherries  and plums  or whatever fruit that
you want. Put in some hot water for the space of two
hours . And when your water  will be cooled, throw it &
turn the opening upside down on a quite even & 
table , & in a room where there is not a bit of air &
of wind . Then en   prepare a stopper of new
wax , wrapped in waxed canvas , and adjust it to the
ampul  quite precisely in order that it will be all ready to
stop it when you will have put in the fruit. And when you will have
delicately picked with your hand  only the fruit  that is
not rotten & on a warm & dry day , return to the
well-closed room, where neither wind nor draft may enter ,
& put it gently & with dexterity in the bottle . Then
stop the bottle  well with the stopper  & lute it

oil , & such that no water  may enter in. Then put your
bottles  in a vat full of water  , during the
summer Et lhiver pourceque la cave s  , in
a cellar , and in the winter  put your bottles 
into a basket  furnished with some weights  & lower
it to the bottom of a deep well . For in the winter 
the water of the vat  would be too cold if the cellar 
is not quite warm, for one needs the water  to be like river

</div><div>Molding
If you want to promptly mold something in demy relief  that
comes to hand, fold some paper   in five or six doubles,
& place it on the medal  & make sure the
paper   is folded on the back of the medal  so
that it is well secured. Next take a stick , broad at one end
& pointed at the other, well softened and rub well on the
paper  , &with the point of the stick  retrace
the lines & proceed until you recognize that your impression is well
done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub oil  with a
pinceau  lemp   on the
>paper   impression and cast in tallow  or
wax  or sulphur , & the paper  , without
it burning, will render your design neat, so that you will be able to
mold it later in plaster  or tripoli , and then in
lead  & other metal .
Polished cardboard   of
little thickness & a little moistened is proper. Then if you want,
strengthen it with papier collé    on the
back.

<div>Small birds 
Benarris   sing at night  if they are left
in serain  , but they are better for fattening for
fine tables than for singing. Chaffinches  are prone to becoming
blind, & their eyes become swollen at the beginning of
August . Goldfinches  like lettuce  seeds very
much, & often one catches them in gardens  on seeded
lettuces  with two lime-twigs . But because such regular
fare would be too expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with
hemp  seed. The passe solitaire   is cleansed
with a spider  , which one needs to give to it
once a week   in order that it does not become
gaillardisse . The calendra  is cleansed with dry
mortar , composed of lime  & sand for keeping it from
becoming gaillardise  & fattening too much. Young small
birds  are cleansed with the same dry mortar , by putting some
pieces in their cages . The cuckoo  lays in the nest of
benarris   otherwise called verdaule  .
This bird  is very simple. I have heretofore given leave to two,
which after several days  returned to their cage. For feeding
young goldfinches , one needs to pestle almonds   with pith   a very little amount
of <add>bread pith</add>  and lettuce  seed  or
hemp  seed . If it is for linnet , some
rapeseed  .
</div><div>Curried steel  and files 
The steel  that blacksmiths  & iron 
workers  commonly use is not refined like that from
Germany  or Biscay , which is reduced in hardness
p   in a bath of a molten iron , but
only  among the iron bars  which are transported in flat
ingots from the forges of Foix   & elsewhere,
there is a harder & whiter & finer kind than the other, as it
comes from the mine . And the workers  choose it
& use it like the other steel . And because it comes from
common iron , they call it strong iron . But it is not as
excellent as purified steel  like that from Germany  &
Biscaye , which is sold in small beads . Some curry

iron  allows itself to be stretched. Thus they separate the
finest steel & , which with another heating they
reduce to a mass. The Germans  make their files  from
strong iron .
One applies steel  to tools
dess   not on both sides, but underneath the part
where one sharpens & whets them. & in this part, they must be of

they reheat it in a pot  with bitumen , &c.

<div>Making counterproofs
Make some soap water  & with this, rub & moisten the
engraved piece that you want to counterproof from, then lay white
paper  on it & rub very vigorously across the top with a
tooth  or the bottom of a glass   & you will
transfer your stamped piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but
if you oil  your paper  with spike lavender & <add>or</add> turpentine oil , it will show
reverse  the right way around on the other side. Then follow
these lines with a pinceau  or a quill , then heat the
paper  & the oil  will go away & leave your
paper  white. And if you want this not to be known, if, by chance,
you borrowed the piece, moisten the paper  and the polishing that
the burnisher  has made on the back, which shows what has been
done, will not be known. The soap water  will turn the piece
yellow, but well-gummed water , which has the same effect, does
not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make gummed
water , then mix some soap  in it & do as is said.
</div><div>Cutters of printing plates  
To clean the copper  plates , or to have worn ones
print better, boil them for four or five good hours  
in a <add>good</add> lye <add>with lye  which is quite
spent</add>. Then make your ink  with some linseed 
oil  & not with walnut  oil  & press with the
rollers . The copper  plates  are sooner made than
wood  blocks , but they are not so appropriate for
printing promptly. The wood  ones are laborious but also will
sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other will have done two. To
carve in wood , the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to
lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the wood  block 
& to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the
wood . Once dry, you then gently rub with a moist
handkerchief  the back of the paper  which, by rubbing, will
become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next,
one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated
glass  & coat with noir d’escaille , to then scrape
& layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make ink  for
copper  plates 

These rollers  are good for printing promptly with cut
cartons  different kinds of pastes .

One can place the plates  among the linens  when the
lye  is quite fine, or also in a pot .

<div> which is different from that of the printers , one needs
to boil walnut  oil  or, even better linseed 
oil , for a long time . & having boiled for a long
time , you will put in garlic   & bread
crusts  to rid it of grease & leave again to boil thoroughly,
then finally you put in one part  of lampblack  that you
have previously ground on the marble   with oil  .
And finally you will mix everything <add>as long as</add> & until
you see that the plate  prints well. Which  And when
you have spread the ink  on it, wipe the plates  well with
the surface of a piece of white paper  . & do this
until the paper   looks clean and then print. If you were
to wipe the plates  with a linen cloth , it would
remove the ink . Linseed  oil  thickens while
boiling & becomes like a varnish  & is in danger of
catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make sure it is in an
open space  or in a place where the flame cannot cause
damage . Some burn tartar  until it is black & grind it
with non-boiled linseed  oil , or walnut 
oil  which others find to be better. This black  is beautiful,
but the lamp smoke  kind is blacker. When you want to print
fr  , take with your fingertip   of
the said black moderately thick , the whole plate  having
first been cleaned in lye  as said, then, rub it with the surface
of a piece of white paper   until the
paper   remains white & do not touch it with the
bare hand because  but with a piece
ofpaper   applied across it. & having cleaned the
plate  perfectly, mi   rub again with a
piece of paper  , fold the edges & sides. Next, take a
small smooth table  & on this a piece of
felt  , then a few sheets of paper   &
finally the one you want to print on, which should be moistened between
two wet napkins . And on this sheet  put your
plate  then another piece of paper  , &
finally anotherfelt  . Then pass between the
rollers . And you can print a dozen pieces consecutively by
always charging the plate  with ink  & cleaning it as
have done. But if you stop printing, the rest of the ink  will dry
in the grooves of the plate . Thus you will have to let it boil
in lye  or urine , as already said, to clean it. The
rollers  must not be too loose.

<div>The Work done in Algiers
Have a colt  of three of four years & feed it on
rye  <add>barley </add> & straw pig  cut in the manner with which they feed horses in
Spain . Let it drink water  from a good fountain or river.
I do not know if it would be good sometimes to let it drink the
water  of sulfur  springs, & to sometimes give it
fenugreek  or other hot foods, for the intention of the
worker  is to use the heat of its manure , & the
climate here is cooler than that of Algiers. Keep it in a warm place
& use it & it should lose none of its manure  &
urine , of which you will make a mass or two in order that while
one cools the other will be of a heat suitable for continuing. Also have
a large long-necked glass bottle as thick as possible, & one finger
if it can be so made, & of the capacity of one pitcher or
earthen  jug. Put into it around St John a dozen & a half
chicken eggs , that is to say, the yolk  without the
glair  & the germ . See ) Others say lx yolks .
And it will be  with this dozen & a half of egg
yolks  put one half ounce (others say lx eggs  & a half
pound) of female silkworm eggs . And after luting well the flask
(I do not know if air will be needed for the generation there). Put
& bury it in the heat of the manure  up to the neck, and leave
it there until several worms  will be engendered. And then
remove the long-necked bottle & do not bury it in the manure 
anymore. But put it on the hot layer of the manure  until all the
worms  will be eaten & consume one another by shriveling and
stirring, and only one remains. Once this has happened, you must entice
it at regular intervals, day & night, with the assistance of two
men, who will care for it in shifts, and you will lure it with an egg
yolk  covered in gold leaf  or with a liquid egg yolk 
into which the gold  leaf has been incorporated. & be careful
that it does not miss such fodder (some say one egg yolk  per
hour, others say three, but the thing itself will demonstrate the
practice). Nourished in this way it will grow in two months or seven
weeks & will become like a serpent , one span & four
fingers long, & one pound in weight. And as the wings will begin to
develop, one will need to kill it, doing so with a charcoal  fire
in a ring around the bottle one span away from it, & at that time
lute the bottle well so that it does not exhale.
 </div> 052v
<div> or to be safer, go away until the fire will have completely died
down and all will have cooled. For the exalation will be dangerous. And
for that occasion, when you take it with some tongs, wash your mouth
with some good vinegar  & take some preservative & cover
yourself well. Once it dies, put it in a cloth or a canvas of
silk  & fold it & hang it from the ceiling, where the air
<add>or</add>  & sun will dry it. Once it is quite dry,
pulverize it in a mortar. And keep this powder carefully, because one ℥
of this thrown on iii lb of melted ♁  reduces it into finer
☉  than the other one. But it is of not so much weight. One needs
also for this work to choose the oldest ♁  that you can, which has
often been melted before & finely hammered into blades or other
works, & at first purify it by melting & throwing it into some
honey  & vinegar . The term for the work is nine months
from Saint John until the 25th April. 
</div><div>Linseed 
Who wants to have it beautiful & p   very
delicate, one needs to pick it before the f d  
seed may be perfectly ripe. For if one waits for the seed to be
perfectly ripe, the foot is so dried by the sun that it is brittle &
breakable. It is true that in this way the seed is reduced by a
third.
</div><div>Colors
If you want to keep them beautiful in gum  and such that they
do not lose any of their natural color, put white wine , the
whitest and clearest you can, in a bottle  with a little
tragacanth gum . And having stoppered  the
bottle , scramble & shake it very strongly together, &
let it rest until the tragacanth  is dissolved. Also put in a
little fine-grained sel blanc   to brighten the whole.
Some mix clear water  with white wine , and with this
mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
beautifully on illumination  works.

Lead  & tin  come out well in white chalk  but
the softer it is the better. The one from Champaigne  reaches

horse  bones  mold very neatly.

I believe that the marrow from the horns of oxen   or
sheep  , that is to say, the spongy bone  from the
inside, molds very neatly and is better than bone .

lean sand  receives it better & absorbs it rather than the

They are produced from seed, that is to say eggs, that which is sold
by the ounce , which is commonly sold in Languedoc  iii
lb  v s . The one from Spain  that
merchants  bring there is considered the best because the
worms  which come from there are not so subject to illnesses
& make more silk . In Spain , one ounce  of
silk   seed, they produce there worms  which
commonly yield ord   xv lb  of silk .
But l’once    from one ounce  of seed
produced in France , they only return x or xii. Three
ounces  of seed are for producing such a quantity of
worms , that with them you will be able to furnish a room
accomodated with three or 4 shelves of large shelves . Willingly
they begin to unskin themselves around holy week . And to do
this, one puts them in a fir  box , like those where one
puts dragée , warmly among feather cushions . And at the
beginning, they unskin themselves like f   little
black ants , & as soon as there are two or three unskinned,
one needs to give them white mulberry  leaves , and then
arrange them on the shelves . And three times per
day  , one needs to exchange fresh leaves . And if
during the day  there is some thunder <add>or rainy
weather, cloud-covered & cool</add> , one needs to keep in the
room  three or 4 chafing dishes &  with
glowing charcoal , & put in incense  until all the
room  would be filled with smoke . And when the
weather is warm &serain  , the silk  abounds
more & and then it is better. Some worms  make it whiter,
others more yellowish. And even if it may be white, it yellows when one
draws it through hot water  despuys  .
The worms , from their birth until the their 
time when they make their cocoons & their prisons , sleep &
rest 4 times, & each time remain 4 or five days  
resting without eating, as if they were dying for rebirth another time,
for each time they change skin & begin by unskinning the head then
consequently, on different days , the s  
rest of the body, & from white turn grayish, & from grayish to
white en fin  . And if one of them has some illness
who does not have the strength to unskin, one needs to help it &
prevent puncturing it, for at that time rendering a yellow liquor, it is
no longer worth anything. And further they scarcely profit after one has
handled it with the hand  . Around Pentecost ,
they begin to want to climb on the dry branches of heath  or
heather  that one prepares for them en   &

How one moves them


 </div> 054r
<div> on some of the high shelves , & at that time, one knows
when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they
hau   lengthen & raise the head & a part of
the body. At that time one carries them to the heather  branches
where they stop & begin to spin their prison, which one calls
cocoon, commonly the size of a pigeon  egg , although
one finds many much bigger because it sometimes happens that two or
three & up to xi worms  are put in a cocoon, which is hairy
& downy all around & , the hair of which is
ferret-silk  or floret  ; & from the cocoon,
which is a white, solid, continuous & firm skin, silk  is
made. The cocoon is so hard that one only cuts it with difficulty with a
fingernail  . And, however, for leaving its prison,
elle   the worm  gnaws it at one end, &
after <add>having</add> stayed inside living on its own sap
il   for three weeks  , it comes
out, diminished by half . For when it begins to spin, it is
as long as a ring finger   & has eight feet, &
coming out it shorter by half  & only has 4 feet. On the
other hand, it has become a butterfly  & has wings, without
flying however. And there are male & female. As soon as they come
out of the cocoon, the male charges the female & one puts them on a
white linen , where they make their eggs. Which female would not
be good & profitable if the male was not given to her. And when the
male has detached himself from a female, one needs to throw it, for it
would not be good to give it to another. They have completed spinning
& making their eggs in three weeks   &
around Saint John 's Day . And at that time one keeps
their eggs & seed until Holy Week  , as
on   is said. Some spin among the leaves & make
their cocoon there without climbing high.

</div><div>Varnish  for distemper 
You can make marble  by distemper  from lake  or
rose of Ghent   & chalk . Once dry, glaze with
lake  mixed in wine , for the glue  makes it die &
blacken. And all will then appear red, but the varnish  you will
put here, which will penetrate, will make dark & light parts appear
as they ought to be. The varnish  is made thus, mix with clear
Venice  turpentine  some spike lavender  oil &  until all is clear & liquid enough, &it is done
without fire. This one es   is for things in
distemper , and the turpentine varnish  that you know, for
panels. Pure spike lavender  oil varnish  is not good for
panels, for spike lavender  oil  is too penetrating &
makes colours sparkle, unless it was made long ago.

<div>Painter
The lake  & floree  rosette of
Ghent   & others lose their color & die in the
air.
All marble   on which a knife  can prick is
worth nothing for grinding fine colors.
Chalk  has no body in oil . Ceruse  is
appropriate. But lead white  more excellent. Ceruse  is the
whitest, when ground first in water , the lead white 
grayish. But the white  it takes on its perfect whiteness in
oil .
When you grind your colors, first clean your workshop 
well, for when walking, if you stir up dust, this will damage your
colors, which will never be beautiful if they are not very
be   clean.
Florey  must not be mixed with azur d'esmail  
or another, for it makes it green.
For palettes  to paint, ivory  is excellent, knots
of the fir tree  , the pear tree   &, if it
is a walnut tree  , make sure the grain of the wood 
runs lengthwise.
L   One always needs to prime
d   on wood  to paint there in oil  in
order to fill the holes & unevenness, and prime with some stil de
grain yellow  & ceruse  mixed in oil , then soften
with a feather , which flattens better than a
pinceau  . Or when the primer is dry, scrape strongly
with a knife .
To use azur d’esmail   in oil , one needs to
choose the most delicate. And to make it subtle, one ought not grind it,
for this makes it whiten. But one needs to wash it, & the roughest
going to the bottom, choose the one that is at the top of the
water  or, by inclination, pour out the cloudy water , then
gather the azur .


@The one who <add>makes his profession</add> working in
oil   will hardly work well in distemper  if he has not
been trained well from adolescence. For the way of working is different,
because when washing the pinceau   for distemper ,
one always leaves it moist. And on the contrary, when one cleans the
pinceau   in oil  to soften, one wipes the
pinceau   well. Otherwise, the work would run &
would soon be disfigured.


The Italians  soften by hatching with a large flat
pinceau   which makes serrations.


And they do not lay their shadow all at once like the Flemish ,
but make them hatching lightest toward the light then a little darker
next & and finally a little blacker to better make recede & come
up.


In distemper  do not mix your different colors together
But  for this makes them die, but use each separately. And in
order that they do not dry & that you have time to soften, moisten
the back of the canvas .
 </div> 057r
<div> Lake  takes long to dry in oil  and for that reason one must
grind glass  in it. But one needs to choose crystallin 
because it is neater. And because it would be too difficult to grind by
itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it
into cold water , & it will be crumbled & pulverized
easily for grinding after. Being well ground it  with a lot of
water , it resembles ground lead white , but for this it has
no body. I think it would be good for casting.
Lead white  is made with sheet lead  beaten subtle & put
under the dung .
White varnish of turpentine  or of spike lavender 
oil  and turpentine   is colored with pulverized
terra emerita  , making it boil together. It gives agold
color on silver  and more beautiful if it is burnished. It is dry
in a quarter of an hour . Aloe  would make brighter
color, but it takes long to dry & the other is dry in a quarter
of an hour , in winter  as well as
summer .


Good lake  moistened with saliva  is rendered promptly dark.
That from Florence  is too gummed.


If you make a layer of printers ' ink  on velvet 
and there apply gold leaf  and then stretch the velvet , it
will appear grainy as if there were gold powder  disseminated on

Vermillion  ground by itself is wan and pale, but ground after
lake , it is more beautiful.
For taking the fattiness from marbles  , one grinds
ordinary ashes  on it, which is good afterward to make the first
primer coat of a panel that is prepared in oil  in order to seal
the cracks & chinks of the wood . It has more body than
chalk  & it has chalk   a certain fattiness.
One mixes it with the aforesaid chalk  or ra  
with the colors collected from the vessel  where one cleans the
pinceaulx  . It is desiccative and spares colors.
On  Once this primer coat is made on the wood , one
scrapes with a knife  to even it. Next one makes a second coat
of ceruse  or of the <add>poorest</add> colors mixed together. In
a painting in oil <add>on canvas </add>, one applies only
one coat, and the same ashes  can be used there. Also, after one
has ground a color, one grinds some pith of coarse bread  on it to
remove the fattiness from the marble  .

<div>Sheath-maker 
Sheath-makers use small, very delicate skins of
lambs  and young goats  , almost like
parchment  and keep them constantly re-moistened in humid
places . When they want to print some history, they layer them in
the hollows of their figure, then put over the top fine fatty
earth  with which cloths are degreased, having pressed & beaten
it well & rendered it moderately humid and soft. Then they put on
the earth  a small even board  and put the whole in a
press  and let it dry <corr>there</corr>. After the
earth , only the leather  remains neatly imprinted   of
the size of a pea  . And then you give the
leather  two or three even layers of copperas black  and
iron <corr>scale</corr> , one after the other, like the
tanners  do. And this dye , being astringent, makes the
leather  shrink & strengthens it and makes it imprint better.
Once dry, one glues canvas  on the back with colle
forte  . In this manner one can quickly imitate big statues &
very delicate medals and paint & decorate them & are light and
portable & last a long time . That which is imprinted on a
relief is done differently and can be passed over again with a hot
iron .

Good crayons   are not made with good glue  but with women's milk .

Venice  masks are made with a hollow & male face of

The Flemish  do not use any whites for flesh colors in
oil  other than lead white  because the ceruse  turns
yellow.
4 or 5 year -old walnut  oil  which is clear
is the best color, it keeps off dust. The kind which has recently been
drawn with the press in the manner of almond  oil  is
white, especially if the walnuts ' skin  is removed.
 </div> 058r
<div> One needs to make at least three layers of flesh color to accomplish
faces in oil . And at the beginning, one puts the black and umber
where it is appropriate. Next, the <corr>heightening</corr> with lead
white  must not be put on the black. Flesh colors and   with
ceruse  going in will yellow in five or six months , but
lead white  does not change.
Florence  lake  is better than the kind from
Flanders  for in Florence  the best dyes are made. To
make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest & liveliest lake  is
the best, for the kind that contains purpurine   &
violet, by admixture of too much alum , makes flesh color like
that of one who is very cold. That is why ladies, wanting to color their
cheeks , ground Florence  lake  very finely, then
fill a little cotton    with it, which they next
wrap in a little fabric of Cambray    which is
clear. And thus they pounce the lake  on their cheeks 
& then, with another clean cotton   , they
soften it.
Cristallin   having been ground with water 
appears to be  have body, but with oil  it does not have
any. It is ground with lake  & with asphaltum , which
would not dry for a very long time  without this.
Spike lavender  oil  is commonly put with lead
white , d   not entirely pure but mixed with a
little walnut  oil . The said spike lavender 
oil  would not be good for lake  & colors that do not have
body <add>for it would make them crack</add>, but with those that have
body & are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.
Verdigris  and orpiment  must first be ground with
urine  rather than thinning them with oil . Thus they are
beautiful & do not die.

When you are making a painting with several persons, just as the
flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows.
</div><div>In fresco
Azure  is not good here, but bleak, & one needs to work
with long  longs pinceaux  . Fresco is not used
cont   on wood 
</div><div>Azure 
Turpentine oil  renders it very beautiful. Assay palma
christi  seed oil . Walnut  oil  in
Flanders  costs at least a hundred sols  a
pint . The azure  requires a little fatty oil 
because it has no body.
Azur d’esmail   hates more than any other to be ground,
especially with water , for it dies & loses all its color.
However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with
water  but with oil  & grind it coarsely, and in this
way it will not die as much.


Always choose the most delicate one
</div><div>Pinceaulx  
When the color has dried inside, & you want to clean them, soak
them in spike lavender  oil  and they immediately will
turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in some
walnut  oil . Walnut  oil is not as
not  as appropriate to soften them as the spike
lavender   kind which is clear like water  & penetrates
& does not have body like walnut  oil . The handle
of pinceaulx   is made by those who work with care from
porcupine  quills , by others from wood  of
arrows fromTurkey  with whom  with which they also
make small rods to rest their hand  when they are
painting .


To work well on a small scale very thin pinceaulx  which
have a firm point <corr>are</corr> needed. And because the hair
taken from the tail of asquirrel 's fur  is soft ,
the most careful take the bristles of the oldest rats  ,
especially of dormice  if they can find them, & put two or
three of them in the middle of the pinceau  . These make
a straight line like a quill   & all the other
hairs  of the pinceau   stick to them as to the
point. The bristles of stone martens  & weasels 
& small animals that make musk   are even better, for a
singlehair  in a pinceau   suffices.
 </div> 059r
<div> Lake  & lead white  & ceruse  are easy to
work in oil , but every kind of azure  is difficult. And to
make beautiful azure , one needs to layer it not with large
strokes of the pinceau   but with small strokes of the
point. Not only ash from Acre    &
azur d’Acre   but mainly azur d’esmail  
which one needs to choose to be very delicate, for it 
otherwise you will not v   be able to work with it
except with great work, and even then you need to thin it with
turpentine  to give it body, and mix it with a little lead
white . Any azure  does not want to be ground or washed for it
loses color & becomes wan. But putting it powdered on your
palette , you will thin it little by little either with
walnut  oil  or turpentine oil ,
<corr>dipping</corr> a knife point  in oil , then
<corr>tempering</corr> it little by little on the said
palette .
</div><div>Shadows
The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear &
thoroughly softened & then the last ones very dark to accentuate
well. The Italians  usually make three shadows, the first one,
of light, very clear, the second one darker & the third ones quite
strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from
the darkest to the clearest.


The varnish  is more beautiful on the panel when the color has
imbibed well.
 </div><div>Azure 
Azure  is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel
without  with walnut  oil  with which it has
been first thinned, without putting in spike lavender 
oil . And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will
not shine, thus appearing to be well-imbibed. If not it will shine
Azur d'esmail  imbibed in oil   distempered
in oil , leaves it & returns to its first nature if you dip it
in water .
Colors for working in miniature want to be thoroughly ground, &
work them with a point of a pinceau   if you want your
work to be well-softened.

<div>Black Painting of armory
Charcoal black  mixed with a little lead white  is very
appropriate to make armory, mixing in a little of   azure  if you wish. Charcoal <add>black</add>  by itself is
as if bluish.
</div><div>Painting of crêpe 
First one needs to make the background greyish with charcoal
black  mixed with lead white  & a little azure .
Then, resu   after it is dry, highlight with strokes
& lines in lead white .
</div><div>Folds in clothing
One needs to take care that none are made which are false, but that
only that which happens naturally is imitated. A thick cloth 
hardly makes any folds, taffetas  & silk cloth  make
more, & crêpe  more still. Make  Observe which ones
should go lengthwise & others across.
</div><div>Desiccative
Lead white  & massicot  are the most desiccative,
nevertheless they need a good two days  . If you want
to prove whether an oil  is desiccative, temper lead white 
with it, & if it produces a crust in a
day    soon it means that it will dessicate.
</div><div>Double layers
Azures , flesh tones and reds are layered twice. The others
not.
</div><div>Mending the cracks in a panel
If a painted panel breaks you can glue  it well on the
reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it &
repair it, it ought not to be with glue  , which rots in damp
weather  & would swell when touched with the oil  of the
painting. But take white wax , which is harder than the other
kind. The oil  mixed in among the wax  prevents it from
melting in the sun . The wax  ought not to be hard, but
soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks & crevices with the
tip of a knife , then scrape.
 </div> 060r
<div> and to prevent it from breaking, mix in a little oil  &
melt them together & fill the cracks & make them even and paint
on them. And the oil  mixed with wax  will
q   help colors to hold since they are also
distempered with oil .
</div><div>First whitening of a panel
One layers two or three times with chalk  tempered with
colle <add>de destrempe</add>   on the panel, not with a
pinceau   but with a broisse   in such a
way as if you wanted to pounce, & leave to dry. And reiterate up to
two or three times, then even the last ground layer out well with a
knife , <add>then give coat of glue on top</add>, upon
which you will next be able to make your impression and then paint. But
make sure that your first white is not too thick for it would break
easily. Flemish painters  have such panels made by
the dozen.
</div><div>Neat work
When you are working, make sure not to stir up dust, & when you
leave your work, cover it so that the said dust will not fall upon it.
Also layer your colors as thinly as you can, for if they are thick you
will be not be able to soften them thoroughly.


Also do not layer color on color if they are not similar, such as white
on black, but rather flesh color on flesh color, & thus with the
others. And leave blank the space for shadow or a different color.
Ains   in this way, layering each kind of color only
on the impression, they will not die & you will work
neatly.
</div><div>Oil 
Walnut  oil  extracted likepeeled
almonds   is very white. This one of Palma
christi  . And when the oil  has had a little body, the
colors soften. For if the oil  is too clear, the colors run &
do <corr>not</corr> bind, even those that do not have body. Fatty
oil  that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for varnish .
The oil  is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as
common varnish . Oils  do not dry as quickly in cold
countries as in hot countries. Oil exposed to the sun 
is clarified well. But it fattens. If you put in ceruse  or
lead filings  or lead white  or calcined pulverized
p  glass . To avoid this, put the vial  in
clear water .
Colors in oil , once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the
second colors, to prevent this, breathe on them & the color will
take.
</div> 060v

Take white <add>turpentine</add> oil <add>&</add>turpentine  & mastic, pulverized & passed subtly
through a sieve  , & boil them together, stirring
continuously with a stick  just until it is dry. And put in two
liards   of good eau de vie . And if you extract
the tear of mastic , it will be whiter & clearer. There is no
need to put in turpentine , but only its white turpentine
oil  & mastic pulverized  at your discretion, until it has
enough body. +

which you will know when it is placed on a knife in the
wind  and does not flow. This one is excellent for panels and is
dry within an hour   and does not stick like
turpentine .
</div><div>Cleaning panels
Some clean them with soapy water , others with urine ,
others with white wine , for dust spoils the colors.
</div><div>Spike lavender  oil 
One ought not to not put any into colors for it is so brisk and
penetrating that it makes the colors flake, which next come off. And for
this reason, painters  use it to clean their oil
pinceaulx   when they have become hard, for it renders them
soft & clean immediately, penetrating the dry color which encrusts
them. Also, painters , sometimes envious of the work
undertaken by another, in the evening  secretly pour a few
drops of spike lavender on the  oil  on the top
edge of the panel such that, running down, it makes a stain that
penetrates as far as the wood  & destroys the colors such
that, to make the work even & of an equal composition, they are
forced to do everything again and thus lose their work.
</div><div>Wood  color


One gives a layer of bistre , then a coat of
varnish .
</div><div>Work of the Flemish 
They do all their works in oil  with the tip of the
pinceau  , in f   the manner of good
illuminators , and grind their colors very finely, protect
against dust, and often clean from their pinceau   the
bits of hair  which they sometimes leave there, for if these
should remain on the work it this , it would prevent neat
working, which they are very careful about. In this way their work
appears very soft, especially in small work, in which one needs to apply
more diligence because one looks at them more closely. They
<corr>usually</corr> finish the forehead, then the eyes, next the nose,
finally the mouth and the rest. But they do not proceed like some others
who fo   layer two or three different flesh tones, one
yellowish & the other darker, because the colors always mix &
finally die. They simply    make their underlayer
<corr>properly</corr>.
 </div> 061r
<div> and even it well then  and once quite dry, they draw their
picture & layer their natural flesh color, leaving the space for
shadow, like the side of the forehead, & the cheek, & the area
around the eyes blank & dry until they have filled in the rest. Next
they put their shadows separately, which they do not make as dark as
they could not naturally be. In sum, they do not put shadow on flesh
color nor flesh color on shadow, but white on white & black on black
Thus  & each on their own. In this way their work is neat
& the colors do not die.
</div><div>Flesh colors
You need to make two kinds of it, one more red to make the main
layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as around the eyes. And
then on this last flesh color, you will lightly touch the main daylight
with a little lead white . But avoid putting too much of it for
this will look like the face of a dead person. The beautiful
Florence  lake  makes a beautiful vivid flesh color that
approaches    the <corr>complexion</corr> of rose
alexandrine   & incarnadine  .


Certain colors do not want to be ground like minium  and
massicot . The ashes  do not want to be ground at all.
</div><div>Rounding off
If you want to highlight well, arr   soften round
things by rounding them off with the point of the pinceau 
& the rest with the flat part  if it is flat, & thus for the
others according to their nature, & lightly with the point of
the dry & flattened pinceau  <add>&</add> with
patience.
</div><div>Lead white 
Without this, you cannot work on a small scale for which one needs
to soften with great care. But you cannot do it with ceruse 
because it does not have enough body.
</div><div>Lights
Your pinceau   shows it to you by casting a shadow
which must always follow the back of your hand , not in a
straight line like this,
 
for the light would be too crude & too harsh, but obliquely & as
if at an incline, thus:
 
The panel needs to not be facing the light  head-on, but half
turned against it. And above all look for a soft light, for it makes
soft both the shadow & the work, like a harsh light makes 
a harsh work.
</div> 061v
<div>Water  to give light for the painter 
Distill some vine water  & put it into a big
bottle . And behind this, put your candle , & it
will not hinder your vision.
</div><div>German chassis 
Germans  who work in miniature make chassis  not of
glass , but of canvas  smeared with clear turpentine
varnish , namely half turpentine oil  & almost
half turpentine , because this light, which is not as bright
as glass , makes them see larger features. And when they want to
make something subtle like veins de   & similar
things, they use pinceaulx  composed of two or three
rat whiskers  .
</div><div>Azur d’esmail   in oil 
One needs too choose the most beautiful  delicate that
will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in
oil . And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can
grind it well, not with water  but with oil , & grind it
thickly. Next lay it on your palette  & mix in a little
turpentine , but not much, to give it a bond, and make it to be as
thick as butter  or mortar , & then, with a fairly
large pinceau  , work it by always moving the
pinceau   back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch
across it in a jagged manner with the  the tip of the
pinceau  . The highlights will be made with
d   the same thinned <corr>with</corr>ceruse ,
which, giving it a bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used
thus. It must be very thick, & such that you all but struggle to
spread it with your pinceau  . And it is all the better
if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it
is very subtle & thin without being ground, and does not run.
Azure  wants to be layered neatly, which is why
quan   it always dies somewhat when layers it over
old, already tarnished, azure  to mend an old panel. In such
matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer & prime again,
then put down the azure . It is thus for almost all other colors.
Also, azure  ground with oil  always remains shiny, which is
not a good sign for azure  for this causes it to die.
</div><div>Grinding colors
A slab of marble & p  glass a
glass  thumb  thick  is more appropriate
than anything else for grinding colours neatly, especially for
lake  & for whites.

<div>Perspectives
Perspectives in oil take a long time  because of
several lines that need to be done with a ruler , and for this
reason one usually does them in distemper . One takes the points
<add>at</add> one’s discretion. The main thing in having the knowledge
of the point. One usually makes two or three of them, sometimes
five.
</div><div>Ochre 
It is put for faces, hair, skulls and rocks.
</div><div>Distant people and animals
One first does them roughly in gray or in purple, which is made of
cendre d’azur   & lake . Once dry, one
highlights & finishes with flesh tones & other colors &
white. And it looks better & is sooner done than in white &
black. Armies  are painted thus.
</div><div>Drawing
After you have primed your panel & scraped with a knife 
to render it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest piece
of charcoal   you can find, for with a short one you would
not see your line so well & would do it more roughly. Let the tip of
the charcoal   be thin, & in order not to render it
dull & blunt soon, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly
sharpen it. Also, hold your charcoal   as far at the end
as you can, & do it  & accustom yourself
af   make a light line. For if you accustom yourself
to drawing delicately with charcoal  , you will do
likewise with colors. And he who is rough with charcoal  
is never excellent with colors. And by a line of charcoal ,
masters  pass judgement on their apprentices . First
make the outline of your drawing, that is the contour, lightly &
without any too careful work, but boldly. In so doing, you will teach
yourself to be an artist , and if you need to to undo
anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it.
Next re-work all the distinctive lines, & do not keep too close to
your panel, but occasionally step away from it to better judge the
proportions. Once the first drawing seems good to you, retrace all the
lines with the pinceau   in rose color or another color
in gum  or distemper . Thus you will work more confidently
with colors, and with less <add>effort</add>.
</div> 062v
<div>Drawing
To become an artist , one needs to draw by
eye  , without compass  or ruler .
Masters  do not allow apprentices  to do this.
When the priming has been long  done, it becomes greasy.
One needs to rub it with ash  & water .
</div><div>Perspective
To know the point, one needs to lay down a ruler  over the
lines, & at the intersection of these the point will be. Some make a
hole at the end of their rulers  to fix the point by that hole
& move the ruler  about. Others lay down a ruler 
across the panel, then on this laid-down ruler  they set the
tip of another ruler , which, attached to the former by way of a
screw , moves about & reaches as far as necessary without
losing the point. The ruler  and compass  without the
judgement of the eye   cause errors. Perspective is very
difficult.

 


To paint perspective in oil , you ought not to use a
ruler , for you would smudge everything. But when layering your
colors you need to keep to the  & follow the lines of your
first drawing.
Also, to make plumb  lines , which go from the top
to make vif   to the bottom of the panel,
you need to have a thread   with some piece of lead 
attached to one end & a little hook  to the other for
hanging the said thread   from the top of the panel.

 
</div><div>Panel
To draw & layer the colors, especially in oil , you need
to hold your panel as upright as you can on the easel , for if
it is slanted there is a danger that some dust & dirt might stick on
it. Keep clean & without dust the place where you paint.
</div> 063r
<div>Amaranth  color
Although it is said to be immortal, it is nonetheless the case that
white wine  removes its tint & turns claret-colored, &
after, the dry flower  ends up white. Note that thus wine ,
& I have tried it. Eau de vie  does as much.
</div><div>Drying of oil 
If the oil  does not dry out, put in massicot  &
minium . There is no better oil than walnut  , for
it does not dry out too soon nor too late.
</div><div>Casting
The Germans  use lead from Flanders   because
it is very soft. And to cast better they take lead ore  & melt
it, & separate what is melted from the from the filth  &
ore , & pour it into a separate vessel , then the
bottom  they cast with it. For the lead  must not have been
put to work before, but rather completely new. Some cast into molds
of iron  & copper  .


or new lead  coming from the mine . They melt it twice
in a crucible . In the first one, they cleanse it of
filth . In the second, they en  cast.
</div><div>Shadows
German painters  make their shadows on flesh
colour of people with ground jet , stil de grain yellow 
& ochre .
</div><div>Bistre 
It is only used in distemper , & with this wood color is
made.
</div><div>Verdigris  and another very beautiful bright green
One ought not to grind it with water  alone, for that makes it
die. To render it beautiful in distemper , some grind it with
vinegar , but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To
render it beautiful, grind it with urine  & leave to dry.
Then, whenever you like, grind it with oil . And after you have
collected it with the spatula , before finishing to clean the
marble  , grind stil de grain yellow  on it. And you
will have a very beautiful green.
</div> 063v
<div>Velvets  and blacks
One needs to <corr>make</corr> the middle  main layer very
d   dark, & the folds & highlights of the same
very bright with white, & on the edge of its light, you make a white
line. For blue & green velvets , you highlight 
touch with shading of peach  pit  black which is very
black. For lake , black of charbon de pierre   which
makes a reddish black <add>on lake  for velvets </add>. The
common charcoal  makes a whitish black.
P  </div><div>Armory
Soft wood charcoal  appears bluish. It is good for making
armory.
</div><div>Stil de grain yellow 
Is made with broom flower   boiled well in
water , putting in enough alum , then ceruse .
</div><div>Red copper 
Some with chalk , but the best has its body with ceruse 
& brazilwood  dye 
.

</div><div>Flanders  blue
In the month of May , one puts the cow 
dung  to putrefy under horse  dung . Then one mixes
with floree  .
</div><div>Snow-covered landscapes
Only three colors are used for it: white, black &
bistre .
</div><div>Softening
If you have worked & made your ground layer with some
desiccative color, such as minium  & similar, finish softening
while the work is fresh, for if you were to wait until the next
day , it would be dry & you would not be able to finish it
neatly.
</div> 064r
<div>Working neatly
Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But
after you have made your design carefully, keep the space of shadows for
these alone, & also individually that of lights & highlights,
without layering one color all across & then highlighting or shading
on it. And in this way, you further your work, economize your colours
& work neatly. Which is the reason that, the colors not being
muddled nor mixed together, they do not die & you soften the colors
better, since they are not so thick.
</div><div>Fatty oil 
It is not good for working with colors because it makes them thick,
& as difficult to work as azur d’esmail . Therefore use the
clearest walnut  oil  that you can, & the
freshest.
</div><div>Vermilion 
One ought not to keep it in water  when soaked <add>ground</add> with oil  for it loses its color. It is better
to choose whitish vermilion  than dark & blackish. For
vermilion  is usually mixed with a little lake , without
which it would hardly be different from minium . But the pale kind
one casts more vivacity than the dark one. It is not desiccative, &
for this reason one mixes in calcined cristallin  .
</div><div>Oil  colors in water 
Usually, after grinding them one puts <corr>a</corr>fo   piece of tin leaf  on top, & one puts
them in water  to prevent them from drying out. But this is more
appropriate for ceruse , lead white , minium  &
massicot  than for the others, for lake  dies there &
loses its color, as does azure vermilion .
</div><div>Double layer
Ver<add>digris</add>  does not die, & thus does not need
to be layered twice. But lake  & others, & especially
flesh color, the  require two layers. Colors hardly change
when they are dry.
</div><div>Yellow ochre 


One needs a little of it in every flesh color.
</div><div>Softening


One softens in the same way on oiled paper  as on wood . But
it is easier to soften on canvas , because the softening must be
rougher on it.
</div><div>Eye


Every eye must follow the circle of the compass  & not be
flat & square.
</div> 064v
<div>Apprenticeship of the painter 
First, one gives him an egg  to do in which one has him make
half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the
parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two
& three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the
charcoal  by the end, & also the pinceau  .
Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to layer colors.
</div><div>One also presents him with these strokes & lines
C  <add>T</add>he figure of the egg  is the
main pattern for faces <add>and for bent bodies</add>, as the cross is
the model for a straight & whole figure. Without these strokes you
will never do well.
 </div><div>Softening
To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but
rather layer them twice, except for azur d’esmail  .


All colors that have no body in oil  have none in
distemper , and  but in distemper  they sink to
the bottom. Distemper  colors want to be greasy, which is
recognised when they gel on the palette  once distempered in
oil .
</div><div>Straight lines
You can use the ruler , but do not lay it flat on the panel,
but as if lifted off, & resting on the edges of the panel. Otherwise
you would smudge everything, & also you would not see the stroke
well.
</div><div>Distemper 
Distemper  colors need to be <add>kept</add> darker
pr   while you temper them, <add>because they whiten
while drying</add>. But oil  colors remain the same in color.
</div> 065r
<div>Shadows
 Because blacks make in different colors, some a reddish black,
others tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which
tend towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in oil , for shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground jet , which you will mix with a little
<add>yellow</add> ochre  & lead white . Or else, after
you have ground your lead white bro   and
clean p   gathered it with the  , grind the jet  into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some
black of  , a little sap-green  & bistre , &
you will have a perfect shadow for women in distemper .


The powder of orberé grain   is darker than
umber  & when you lack umber , the said powder will do,
but it does not have body.
</div><div>Flesh color
You must know well the mixing of colors & the appropriate
shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note &
observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise,
as if going from lett re a ga   right to
left like

 

, and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.
</div><div>Mirror 
When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a
cristallin  mirror  , which represents
well after nature, and in which it  you will see if your
shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a
candle , for firelight  will make the shadows reddish.
The painter  also teacher himself with the mirror ,
for he sees in it what the natural can do.
</div><div>Greasy colors
If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
colors have penetrated, it means that this part is greasy, & that
the second colors one layers on would not take on the dry layer, unless
you rub this part with soap  or breathe on it, because the
humidity will make the colors take.


One cannot layer oil  on cut paper  & model as in
distemper  because the colour would run. Thus, to gild  with
or mat  , one needs to pounce & then layer the gold
color  with the pinceau  .


All greasy colors, such as ceruse  and minium ,
massicot , ochre , lead white  are good for making
gold color.


Any color or thing that thickens when water  is put with it when
it is being ground has body. But those that lack it, such as
cristallin  , lake  & become clear.
</div> 065v
<div>Semi-lively colors
When colors a  absorb into the canvas , it
means that it has been primed only once, & for this reason they
become matte without <add>being</add> shiny. But this is the best way,
as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having
more body, do not die & are all the more beautiful for it,
especially azure  ,lake  & those do not have body. But
those who want to rush their painting prime twice on the first go, to be
done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as
long. The second layer of these does not absorb & remains
shiny.
</div><div>Painting large figures
You need to put your charcoal  at the tip of a stick 
such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close,
you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain
& sufficient distance. Also, when you paint up close, hold your
charcoal  at the farthest end, & practically with your
fingertips . For in this way you will acquire an
artist 's l  touch & give your hand 
effortless facility.
</div><div>Glazing
One usually glazes with colors which do not have body, such as
lake  & verdigris . However, to use other kinds, one
mixes in plenty of calcined & crushed cristallin , which also
has no body & makes  lightens their thickness.
</div><div>White and black
It is good that an apprentice  should work with white
& black for two or three years  to become an
artist .
</div><div>Lead white 
It does not die & has a lot of body.
</div><div>After nature
There are some who paint after nature on oiled paper , &
if they do not finish in one go, they put their paper  &
unfinished picture in water  so that it shall not dry.
Illuminators  painting on paper  temper their colors
with gum  & mix in a little soap  to make them run
better.
Painters  must all learn how to draw after nature, for to them
it is travel provisions & revenue & sure means of earning their
passage when travelling across the lands with only their
cocon  .
</div><div>Priming layer
One needs to be quite careful about this, & not do it, as some
will, with gold color which is made with the washing water of
oil pinceaulx  , because verdigris  &
other corrosive colors which are in it will in the end cause the death
of the colors that are meu   layered on next. It is
good to do it.


with ceruse , & a bit of yellow ocher , &
a little massicot , & make it not too thick so that it does
not crack.
</div> 066r
<div>Double layers
The Flemish  & those who paint panels by the dozen only
make one layer & finish at the first go. But the colors soon die.
And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer
them lightly & not very thick, to soften them well.
</div><div>Shadows
For women, asphaltum , umber  & a little
lake .
</div><div>Painting in distemper  on wood 
Because it is very tedious to paint in distemper  on
wood , and because one is at great pains to make a good
a  face on it, some thin their colors with egg glair 
passed through a sponge , or mixed with the yolk ,
water , & thoroughly beaten with the skin of the fig
tree  . With this | they paint & soften on the wood ,
as with oil , and this supports the varnish , but this does
not last.
</div><div>Colors in oil  that are imbibed
It is best that colors in oil  are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
oil  has remained in that part which would make the colors die.
The varnish  mends all this & unites & renders it similar
in one place as in another.
One needs gold color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it
would be imbibed & would run.


On canvas  & in distemper , one gilds with bole 
& honey  & a little garlic juice .

The Flemish  give one layer of colle à
destrempe   on the moulding, then mix lamp black  or

Next they pounce some moresque  in the corners & paint it
with minium , massicot , & ochre de ru  ,
<add>and a little yellow ocher </add>, mixed with fatty oil 
in which they clean their pinceaulx  for oil  ,
because the three aforesaid colors are gripping & dry immediately.
Next they lay down the gold , then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
oil , but it would not be good because the gold  would
attach itself everywhere & not only to the moresque . Go
back to the top to *

let it dry & rest one day  , next rub the gilding
with a feather  & cotton    in order
that no burrs remain, then varnish with Flanders 
varnish , which you make mixed with a little eau de
vye  , to render it desiccative.
The varnish  will be dry in an hour  . It
will increase the color of gold. And this or mat   holds
in the rain , even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried
for eight or ten days  .
Gold color that is made of different colors cleaned from
pinceaulx  for oil   is not so good, & with
time , tarnishes the gold because of the verdigris . One
must not touch with a finger  the layer made <corr>for</corr>
the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The or
moulu   is spoiled if water  touches it, but the or
mat   holds well in the rain  & in water .
One must not burnish it, because the tooth  would remove it.
Gather the burrs & small flakes that the
cotton    makes lift off when the gold  is
dry & you clean it, for an ounce  is still gold . In
Flanders , women make gild . It is more
beautiful when it is a little thick, but in France  they beat it
too delicately.
Breathe on the gold color, and if it tarnishes, it is dry enough,
but if it does not receive the vapor of the breath, it is not
enough.
One must not gild or mat   after with 
having gilded . But wait one day or one night , But
take heed not to  and once it is as if dry, it grips the
gold . After, one varnishes.

When gold color starts to grip, it is a sign that in ten or twelve
hours   it will be dry & appropriate for
gilding .

To make or mat   beautiful, put in a little varnish

To make them well, cut the hair from the tail of a
squirrel ’s fur , as much in one go as one can hold in a
card  folded up into a small tube . And putting it thus into
the aforesaid folded card , tap <add>it</add> & shake
<add>it</add> such that the hair  gathers together & becomes
of the same length. Put one or two bristles of a rat ’s
whiskers  in the middle, then, grabbing it with the fist &
pinching it well with the thumb  & index finger ,
thoroughly dip the tip of all this hair  in water , then,
moving close to
 </div> 067r
<div> 

light, pull out the hairs  which make the tip too long with the
ends of your fingernails , and this until the tip seems good to
you, & and until you notice in it the rat  hairs 
which are entirely black & the hair of the
petit-gris   is at the  whitish from the root to
the middle. When it pleases you, bind b   and tighten
it very well with a thread  in two places, then cut the excess
& fit it in a quill  of a convenient size for it, of a
duck  or a crow  for the small ones. Good
pinceaulx   are those that, once soaked in water ,
do not bulge when you trace on your hand .
</div><div>Oil 
All oil  which is imbibed by paper  & once heated by
fire evaporates & leaves the paper  clean, like
turpentine  & spike lavender  oil , is good for
making varnish .
</div><div>Sand
Everything ground & tempered becomes porous, according to
some.
</div><div>Bellows furnace 
Before you put in the metal , it is necessary that it be red
at the bottom, like like a charcoal  & well inflamed. Next,
you    fill it & cover the charcoal  &
adjust the bellows , otherwise the metal  on top would
melt as a result of the bellows  & its bottom would be
curdled & cooled & would not run. But if you proceed in this
manner you will melt everything you like.
</div><div>Varnish  on paper 
The Germans  make boxes p  covered with painted
paper  & varnish it with glair of the egg  mixed with
gum  & a little oil , not of spike
lavender  , but another odorant  that resembles
olive  oil  . Every work done with glair 
supports oil . It is with this that painters  trick the
poor peasants , painting their bands of taffeta  with
this glair , to be done sooner. But the first rain 
carries away everything.
</div> 067v
<div>Files 
If they are not trempées à pacquet , that is, in the manner
described, with soot , salt , & vinegar , they
will not be good. The square  large square files  used
by locksmiths  for their rough work are only made of
doulx  iron , But the soft files  must be made of
steel . Founders  whose work is to repair latten 
& copper  must have their files d  
coarse otherwise they would fill up with the copper  which would
make them smooth & soon render them useless. Latten , which is
more brittle, welcomes softer files  than copper 
does.
</div><div>Bones of the foot of oxen  for sand 
Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very
neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the
flame of straw . But if you mold them in a noyau , give it
its first layer, simple & very thin, with a
pinceau  , & leave to dry at ease. Next fortify the
following layers with wadding  mixed with the said tempered
sand of bone .

It is the neatest sand that can be found for copper .
</div><div>Huiles d'essence  
<add>Walnut </add> oil  mixed with as much of
turpentine  & distilled by an alembic  renders an
essence whiter than common water . But this has no body & does
not give a bond for colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
the color without stickiness and faded. These, imbibed in this way,
would not let you work or soften, no more than in distemper . But
you rectify this fault, by giving it a little body with
turpentine , not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
work with azur d’esmail   & will make a perfect
lead white . Turpentine varnish  made with this oil 
is dry in one hour  .
</div> 068r
<div>Fanciful tables
You can make various grooved compartments & in these, put
fishes  painted after nature & with colors on simple
carton   & if you please, on silvered &
burnished  paper  which will represent the scales. And next,
cover this with very clear lantern horn . You can apply the same
to other works.
</div><div>Planting trees
 One needs to plant them in a dry place  dry weather , & plenty of earth  gathered at the
foot all around, like a mound, so that the rains  do not fill
the holes & drown the trees.
</div><div>Casting
I have tried four kinds of sand for lead  & tin :
chalk , crushed glass , tripoli  & burnt
linen , all four excellent. But as for the chalk , it needs to
be of the softest kind you can find, like the Champagne  one
that painters  use . It releases very neatly, does not need
to be moistened with magistra  or anything else, but needs to be
completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized. The first cast
is always the neatest, however it will well withstand two or three. But
there is only the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want
to remake your box mold  to take new powdered chalk  that
has not yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the box mold
has dried out & has no stickiness & bond like the fresh one.
Crushed glass  can be made from common glass sand, however
cristallin  is more excellent, for common glass  contains
glass  salt of saltwort  only, but
cristallin  contains both salt of tartar  &
saltwort  all together, which both help fusion, the glass 
once calcined & reduced to as if to its prime substance. In order to
calcine it perfectly, throw your glass , lumps of whichever sort,
among the largest possible lit charcoals  that you can, if you are
lacking some other t <add>d</add>e foeut  violent
heat source. And when it will be well red, throw it into
water .
Putty  is considered excellent for these two metals .
 </div> 068v
<div> and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your
fingers   and to easily grind it in a metal 
mortar , or better yet, in an iron  one . Next, it
will be easy to grind it, not only  on common
marble  <add>that would corrode</add>, but on
porphyry  , and it is necessary that it be finely ground
with <add>water </add> so that when putting it on your
fingernail  , you find it soft without any asperity like
the colors that the painters  grind for oil . You can
use au lii   this one, once dry, in a box mold instead
of sand, without moistening it with anything nor reheating it. If you do
not like it, fumigate the cavity with sulfur  smoke or de
p   with the tip of the flame of a wax candle  
that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat & shiny &
polished work, in <add>pure</add> lead  & tin . I would
say the same for finely pulverized tripoly  that does not want to
be not  reheated or moistened. Burnt linen  gives less
trouble than others, because it does not need to be reheated, nor
moistened, & molds <add>and releases</add> very neatly &
very , subtlety & releases well  neat, like the
previous ones & withstands several castings. First you ought to burn
it with a flame, then leave it to rest & to be consumed with its
fire until it is completely dead, then finely grind it on
marble   or on a paper  . But because a
lot  And if you reheat it in a crucible , red hot due to
the fire, to render all of it fine & impalpable, I believe it will
be even better. But because a lot of linen  is reduced to very
little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
medal that you want to mold & cover it, and fill the box
mold  with crushed slate , which molds also very neatly, but
note that the first cast is always the most beautiful & the neatest.
If you cast at your convenience soft tin  that seems to be
burnished in little wheels that pewterers  sell, comes out
very neatly & approaching the color of silver , without mixing
in anything else, it is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &

</div><div>Sand
You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way lean
& arid, such that it does not bind at all, like the one from the
sea   or desei  from sandy
paths  dried out by the sun  . But <add>choose</add>
them or in t   preferably from
quarreries  ries  or rock caves ,
because that one is best, as long as it is very fine. You will know the
vein if, in the greyish rocks  or quarries qu   that seem to be made of arene  ,
you see after rainy weather  , certain little
amounts like dust attached to the said rocks , or if a little
piece flakes off, easily crushed between your hands  ,
due to humidity. You will also find it in lean soils , which comes
off in lop   large lumps like stones of
tuf  et ne  , or among terres
boulvènes   , which are much better than those from
fat & strong earths . And one ought not to take it from the
surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth , but three
or 4 feet   below & the closest to the
tuf   or stone . Since it comes out in large lumps
one would say it starts to form itself in stone. But when it is wet, it
comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it
is well granular, & that when crushing it between the
fingers  , it renders itself really very fine, like
impalpable , keeping nevertheless its asperity of
arene  , without muddying  the
fingers   like clay . It dries up slightly on the
fire, then it disintegrates & passes finely through a double
sieve  or a linen  sleeve , then takes moistures with
wine  or magistra  & @ / Verte 

The Toulouse molder  reheats it strongly then grinds
it finely on marble   and passes it through a
linen   & moistens pass   it with
wine . He makes the cast very broad & ne  
flat & barely deep. He casts pure latton used for scales 
& similar thin things. He casts very hot.

@ Try calcined vitriol .

<div> The sand near my area  is very excellent. But one ought
to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been
used. For it dries out after having been cast several times & is
lean & has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any
thickness, it is necessary that your substance of copper  be very
hot so that it penetrates & runs. Some mix in lead  with the
fonte , but it is for large works & not for small ones.
Sand from oxen  feet twice-burned & finely ground 
melts more neatly with copper , & without a chappe ,
than sand that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and
f   with a thickness as delicate as a knife 
blade or a card . And being a hollow on one side, opposite the
relief which was on other side.
It is necessary that lean sands  be more moistened than
others, namely with magistra  or good pure wine  or
boiled wine with elm tree  roots  & similar things.
But very fine sands , like burned linen  which is fat &
soft on its own, want to be applied dry.
All moistened sand wants to be very beaten & stirred in order to
be ground finely \& to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself
when it is bathed.
The olive  oil  that some mix in with beaten egg
white  makes it become porous.
Sand of calcined glass  withstands several castings, but there
are only the first ones. It also becomes porous.
Latten  comes out on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is
good to mix it with a little copper , like a quarter
part , with the substance of skillets .
Founders  cast well box molds up to 30 or 40 lb ,
but not more.

It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for
releasing. Il   because it crumbles. It is good that
it be alloyed with some fat thing which has bond such as molded
tripoly  or ab  burned felt  or sal
ammoniac  or tripoly  & similar things.
 </div> 070r
<div> When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the smoke of
the substance you are melting, because the cast absorbs the quality
oe  <add>f</add> the metal , which runs
afterwards more easily in something that comes from it.
Human  bones  are the best for casting once
calcined.
To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot
& to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some
iron scales , or in powder or otherwise E  , for
it heats copper  a lot & cleanses it of its fat . At the
end, when you want to cast, add some saltpeter , by folding your
additions in a paper   so that others not know what you
are adding.
Sheep  foot bones  are even better than ox 
foot bones .
Oil  & tallow  make it really porous &
crushed glass  & copper  alone.
Cendrée  earth  molds very neatly.
Ashes  do not have enough body to withstand
copper .
It is best not to mix the sands, but fill the box mold  with
one only.
Latten  is always fat, & does not mold neatly. One finds
that it comes out better alloyed with a quarter  of
copper , but it needs to be cast very hot.
Copper  comes out well with a bit of metal . If you mix
in metal  within latten , it will be more brittle & more
troublesome.
A slightly coarser sand has more body.
Sand from corp   rock  is always better,
which seems like tuf   in lumps, which has a beautiful
& very fine grain, & a little fat. One crushes it, then one
dries it in a skillet  on the fire, until it is  stops
smoking, then one passes it through through a double sieve 
& fine, & one molds with it.
Copper  or latten  cannot come out well if the medal does
not sufficient thickness, & if it does not have it, give it some
with some wax .

Some cast through a hole made in the middle of the reverse side of the
medal.

Some wanting to cast large works in latten y  
mix in the sand some crushed glass  to give the earth  some
bond. But it makes it porous, and needs to be repaired.

</div><div>Mulled and sugared wine 


When the English  have a cold, they mull wine  in this
manner. They heat it in a large tin  pot  until
it boils, and when it is boiling up, they remove it from 
light it with burning paper  to know if it is hot
enough . Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one
vessel  into another, as one who wants to beat eau
panée  , and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a
burning paper  what is falling from one vessel  into the
other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the
wine  is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few
cloves  & a sufficient quantity  of sugar . And
they dri  drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.


The common English  put sugar  in wine  to imitate
for themselves the sweet new wine  which they cannot have because,
owing to the long sea crossing , the wine  has lost its
sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.

To a half lb  of spike lavender  oil , put in

pulverized subtly  . And first, boil your oil  in a
pot  on a chafing dish , and then mix in little <add>by
little</add> the aforesaid gums , stirring continually with a
small stick split and quartered at the tip , & when you do
not collect gum  with the tip, that is to say that it is totally
melted & that your varnish  is done. And to render it clearer,
put into the concoction a little lump of camphor . It is true that
with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the spike
lavender  oil  will be good, clear & not fatty, otherwise
your varnish  will be worth nothing. You can test it
d   by soaking some paper  in it & heating
it. If the oil , which will evaporate, leaves the paper 
clean, without being  a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is
fatty.
</div><div>Sheep  fat
In a certain region of England , the sheep  that
graze there have very yellow fat and are nevertheless just as good as
others.
</div><div>Spider 
In Ireland , one finds none there, & if one touches them

& spiderwebs.
</div><div>Sand
The cimolée   is very good for casting in
copper , but one ought not take the one from
cutlers  , because it is only sludge , but rather the
one of those who moulent   mold large shears.
Pierres de filieres , which knife grinders  use for
whetting, mold very neatly, once scraped, for lead . It is
commonly slate -colored. One frequently brings them to
Toulouse  from around Carcassonne  .
</div> 072r
<div>Printers ’ letters
Those who make them, mix into the lead  some
nails  nailheads  & old
horse shoes , & antimony  which makes it all
melt. This composition is strong for printing, &holds steadfast. It
runs and is good for casting in lead .
</div><div>Casting in copper 
It is necessary that the box mold  be well smooth & that
it fits well also on the board  where it sits, so that it holds
firm & does not shift when one moulds. It is necessary that the sand
be clean & well chosen and well reheated, & pulverised very
finely on the marble  , for the one that you want to put
first on the medal, and when molding you press strongly. Guard against
oiling  your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly
and reheat well, & let cool. Moisten your sand with wine boiled
with elm  root , and cast latten  which comes out well,
namely from the substance of the trebuschets   and similar
thin things. Make your cast broad & even if it is barely thick, it
will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the mold . Cast
from the foot of the medal, so that the face, further away from the
heat, comes out better & sweetened from the violent heat. And if
your box mold  does not have vents, make some
qu   in the sand, which come, from the corners of the
piece, to render themselves into the cast. Cast very hot, something that
you will know, when you cast a little leftover substance in the one
which has already been melted, & if it melts quickly, this is a sign
it is fo   well hot. At that time, invigorate the heat
of your furnace  with bellows  of the right size,
keeping the mouth of the furnace  well covered with some big
copper  tile   or other similar thing,
which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take
your well red mollettes   & the crooked
iron   as well, to clean the charcoals  which are in
your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a latten 
wirebrush . The grindings from sharpening large scissors &
large knives  is very good for copper .


One believes it to be a great secret to add in it
persicaire  , which renders them soft as lead .Try
to extract salts  from it.
</div> 072v
<div>Casting
Lead , which is mortified & weighty, wants to be cast hot,
more so than tin . And when it is not hot enough, it makes lines
in the medal. It Straw  burns in it, provided it is
hot. One can make a solder  so soft & runny that it can be
melted in a tin  dish . It is composed of one
part looking glass tin , one part soft
tin , & another part lead . It runs very neatly
and is cast in leaves, but the work is very brittle & prone to
breaking. The best solder  is the common one for casting well, but
is  leaves certain lumpy points. Alloy lead  with
tin  so that the ingot that you will cast comes out even &
shiny & polished, & without any eyes or bubbles except for a
small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is
enough tin , otherwise the lead  dominates too much. Sand is
good for lead  & tin . The good one is very thin &
fine & lean, which however sticks together between one’s
fingers  . The sand wants to be reheated before putting
it to use. And once  to mold <add>with it</add>, it wants to
be very moistened & then reheated, not all at once nor with a burst
of fire, for this corrupts & makes it shrink & crumble as well.
But if you reheat it gently, it renders itself very stiff, once well
moistened. One ought to pass it through a shirt
<add>sleeve</add>  for the finest one, in order to first put some on
the piece to mold.
One makes a solder  with quicksilver but which is white, but it is brittle. Make your box
mold  so that it joins well & that one does not see the daylight
between the joints.
The Germans  cast their leads  very thinly, rather
than very thickly, because it seems they come out better, but so that
are not too pliant, being so thin, they mix a little tin  with the
said lead , which otherwise would fold up like wax .
The blackest lead , so say some, is the best & the softest
& which runs the best. You will know its goodness by rubbing it
with your finger  , which will render it very black
quickly . 
The alloy good for running lead  & tin  is per one
lb  of lead , one lb  & a half of tin aultr  , so that the tin exceeds more than one
part . It is solder  which flows well & that is good
for casting, but it is brittle.


To make the lead  flow well, one puts in a little
quicksilver .


Rub cuttlefish  bone  on a well smooth table  to
flatten it & one against the other & cross the two bones 
with pegs  to mark the place.
Cuttlefish  bone   molds lead  better than
anything else. But try it to see if it needs reheating. One ought
to mold on the back of the bones  & from this side for the
marrow  is more delicate there. 


The bone marrow  towards the tail is more delicate & does have
not as many stripes & molds more cleanly. The shell  which
holds the marrow , once calcined, is good for making sand.


When you cast lead , one ought to cast it cast very
neatly <add>rather</add> hot, & not at once & shake the
box mold  a little & cast two or three times. However, if it
is cast too hot, it will rise up & swell. When it is very hot, it
becomes blue, let it then pass this color deva   &
rest a little before casting.


Some, such as printers , mix iron filings  or
pins  in the lead , but  in order to render it
hard. But this renders it brittle &not  it breaks under
the hammer .


Take a wirebrush  to clean your molds .

</div><div>Recipe for making bronze  and varnish  of many
sorts
For making excellent varnish  with clear water  which
you will use with a pinceau   and immediately dries, for
putting on paper , a tablet, or another piece.
First, you will take five ounces  of eau de
vye   and one ounce  of benzoin , crushed between
two pieces of paper  or card  or in a mortar .
 </div> 077v
<div> but it should not be too small, then take    a
glass  vial  not too big and put into it a half of these
two, namely two & a half ounces . Next take the said
benzoin just as roughly crushed , and put it to use with the
aforesaid water  and let it rest for the space of one & half
days  , & then take the said water  &
put it into another glass  vial  & soak it very well.
And on the rest of the said benzoin  that remains at the bottom of
the said first vial , put the rest of the water  over this
and do as before when you see that the case is going well, and mix the
first water  with the second. By means of this you will be able to
help yourself to this for something more noble.
</div><div>Another approved varnish 
Take two ounces  of linseed  oil  & two
ounces  of huille petrolle   and two
ounces  of mastic , the whitest you can find, and of
alung de glace  , & grind it, and take a little bit of
white copperas , and put all these drugs  together into an

crucible  with lead until it causes it . And
increase the fire & mix to make the substances alloy well. The
mixture for large letters is harder.
</div> 080r
<div>Mortar
They make them of fine material and fine copper in the shape of
reinforced barrel, and which can hold 50 pounds of powder, and having
made a clean hole in the ground at the foot of a wall, they embed the
said loaded mortar in this hole, with the mouth on top, which will make
a large breach.

</div><div>Fountains
 If you wish to make water  rise higher than its source, make a
pipe  descend as in A B  to B in order to give it push
to the water  , then from B <add>to C</add> make the
pipe  ascend again, which should not quite attain the height of
the source, which is represented to you by this horizontal line, then
make the pipe  descend again from C to D, then raise it again,
higher than the line showing the height of the source. And do this
successively until you have reached the desired height, heeding
nonetheless that the length of the descending pipe  should be
twice as long as the ascending pipe  . This
cornet  folded back on itself also shows you a perpetual
fountain which you can fit into some rock, pulling the water  with
which it is filled by the tip marked E , by sucking &
breathing in. You can also make a watering pipe in this manner, in order
that the trussed-up length is as long as  its straight pipe,
& nevertheless does not descend as far down.

<div>Founders of small works <add>@ of
tin </add> 
They usually cast with solder , even the things that should
not become empty, for the latter require fine & soft tin ,
which however would not release, & would not become empty if it was
mixed or had some looking glass tin mix <add>in</add>
it, just like they put in a little of it in soft tin . They carve
their works on stones of which are made the sharpening stones or
files of barbers  , which are found in great flakes
towards the mountains , & resemble slate . They are three
colors of them: reddish, which is not as perfect as the others because
it does not last as long in the fire & as ,one
dard   of the color of dark slate , the other
whitish. When they have some relief, first they imprint it on
carton   , as thick as one
finger  , <add>to serve as a pattern</add>, then with a
little compass  & little matching iron fittings , they
carve their figures, having first flattened their stones  &
worn down one against the other, they make their p  
molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins
perfectly, because the stones  render themselves even. Before
casting, they rub the mould with tallow , which has quickly
absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking fine powder of
quicklime  in a linen  , they rub the mould while
beating with the linen   on top, then blow a little on top
to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents, if
the work is a little large They make them in this manner, as you see
represented here. They pierce a hole in some place on the medal that is
least visible. And then with a gimblet  they pierce the mold on
the side of the medal.

 

And if they want their work to stay pierced in any place, they drive in
a piece of cork   at this place in the mold . And
the lead  or tin  will not attach to it. 

Make sure the pegs  of your box mold  enter easily so
that opening  it will easily open without shifting anything;
and that your box molds  fit well together; & the table
is very flat . 

Try to carve with distilled vinegar .

Try calcined oyster  shells ; one says that they are
excellent for molding.
</div> 081r
<div>Sand
One can find an excellent one on the little hill  of
Puy David  near Thoulouse  for lead , tin 
& copper . It does not want to be too reheated much because,
drying out all at once, it loses its stickiness & burns at the first
arrival of metal , which makes the work lumpy & not neat. It
is better to reheat from a distance, rather than with a straw 
flame, which generates des   some filth . Before
filling in the box mold , you can put in the finest sand you
have in a very fine linen  , & pound the medal dry and
then the moistened sand that you put on top, which has more body, will
grip it.
Tallow  makes it porous.
Fixed mercury  mixed in when one wants to cast, makes
metal lead  run. But if it is pure, one ought to cast
very hot so that it runs, and vents.
</div><div>Earth  for molding
Tanner 's earth, or the one with which
potters  make a whitening on pots  to make lead  run
better on them & to prevent the lead  from being absorbed into
them, is very good for molding the cavities of things you want mold in
relief. It releases better than plaster  or sulphur  which
become hard once they have set. For the earth  being ready, one
ought to be beat hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very
large you can mould it in several parts. If you reheat it, it is
necessary that it be over a closed fire. One finds this earth  at
Fosseret  & in another place called Ox .
</div><div>Plaster 
It is necessary that it be well heated, which you will recognize
when cooking it in an iron  or metal  skillet , you
mix it with an iron  rod , & if it attaches to the
iron , it is not heated enough, if not, it is good. The
water  with which you moisten should be a little warm & the
mold  made with the aforesaid earth  also a little hot.
The work of plaster  does not last & the faces & delicate
things break if one does not give a coat of glue .
</div><div>Carton 
One ought to take paper from Florence  , which is the
finest, & crush it & soak it several times & change the
water every day , so that it does not smell bad, &
since you will have moulded it in the cavity, put a
linen   over it, & from the back, rub the back of the
paper  with a tooth , as if you wanted to burnish it, and
it will mould very neatly. Then glue  the cloth  on the back
with strong glue . 
</div> 081v
<div>Sand
Only brick  very finely sifted, & worn down one against
another, is good for all castings of lead  and copper ,
mixed with urine . It is necessary this be whitish
brick .
</div><div>Making copper  and latten  run
Put in, at the end, when it is very hot and you want to cast, sal
ammoniac  & saltpeter , which removes filth  &
heats it. Mix some ardides   with the latten . @
Guard against the metal  touching the iron  or the
latten  of the box mold , but cover it with sand  or
lute . Make the cast very even.
</div><div>Sand
Calcined black pebbles from the river   are good for
lead , but they are shaken loose for metal .
There is only   clay earth with which one can
make tiles  , reheated & reddened & passed through a
sleeve  finely moistened with glair .
Willow  charcoal  is excellent for sand for
b  lead .
Latten  runs better.
</div><div>Casting in a frame 
It is good to make it with boxwood  . Turn it in order
to make it even, as this is important for the casting. Lute  also,
or cover the mouth of the frame  with sand so that the melted
metal , or lead ,or copper  does not touch the
frame ’s iron  or latten , because it makes it
brittle, & makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always
higher than the mold . Also guard against the cast being too
wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
the weight of the substance that runs breaks & shakes loose the
mold  & makes it porous. When you have cast, gently tap the
frame  , so that the substance spreads better. Black lead of
saulmon   from the first melting makes a very neat one.
</div> 082r
<div> Heat of copper 
It is hot enough when you see it neat & even on top, without
filth .
</div><div>Frame
Iron  & copper  make it porous if the metal 
touches it, & the wood  warps. Thus, make a mold of
wood , & have frames of bricks  made inside this mold of
whatever thickness that you want.
</div><div>Glair of eggs 
Glair of eggs  gives strength to sand to make several
casts.
</div><div>Clockmakers 
To divide the teeth of their cogwheels proportionately, they do not
use a compass , for there is none so fine that it can
compass distances as small as those of the small
cogwheels . But they make a platteforme  (as they call it)
of latten fais   divided into several circles,
& each circle is divided into equal distances  marked by a
point, and each circle has a certain number of them, for example one 30,
another 36, another 40, &c. Then, on the pierced center of the
platteforme , they set the small cogwheel there, and on the
center of the cogwheel a flat line or alidade which is moved to the
circle with the number that you want to mark on your cogwheel. Then they
draw a line on the cogwheel with a prick , then move the alidade
to the following point, & continue to mark thus. And to mark the
points on the circles of their platteforme , they divide the
circle into three & then divide this third part into as many
distances as is necessary with regard to the total division of the
circle , & make in this manner their division & distribution
of the teeth as fine as they please.

Never does Lead  come so neat as tin .
</div><div>Sand
If it is too fat, one ought to reheat it and sieve it again.
</div><div>Method of casting in bronze 
Latten of potin  cor  , which is
the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many
people, than fine latten of skillets , just like all fine
latten  molds neater than red copper . If you want to cast
something fine & thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as
possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot
enough when it smokes a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat
well, place your crucible  as low as possible & at the very
bottom of the forge , so that the bellows fra   beat on the middle of the crucible , for
in this way it is better than on the grill  on which one usually
puts the crucible , under which the bellows  beat. It is
true that the crucible  risks more danger breaking, but you can
lute  it as you know founders  do. And also, one ought
to maintain the charcoal  between the bellows  & the
crucible . Also take heed to cast all at once & not in
increments & drop by drop, which would stop & plug up the
conduit of the substance. And if you were to make in the cast an
abreveoir  to aliment the medal, it would be even better. And so
that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with
a wood  stick , for iron  only makes it brittle.
Turn.


Some put wool stuffing  in order to heat it & make it
run.


Put under your crucible , one large iron platte  , which will redden & will maintain the heat
under your crucible .


The copper  substance is found to be good for casting, when once
broken it makes the grain long & not short, for it demonstrates that
it is soft. It is half fine latten  & half red copper . This long grain is called long stalk.

Alabaster calcined  in a crucible  over

the sand can still be used by placing it in a damp place 
& drying it in the fire.
</div> 083v
<div>A way for molding excellently with water 


Dissolve in damp place  some tallow of glass , and then
place this water  on what you want to mold, having encircled it,
and place it to coagulate on the hot ashes . Do the same with
vitriol  & copperas , which, once well calcined, reduce
in water .
</div><div>

Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.


It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper , latten  or
similar metal , very neatly, and then when you have molded the
cavity in the sand, leave the figure of metal  that
<corr>you</corr> have molded in the frame , without moving it
from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a
little & push the figure down in the frame .


It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the
filth  & grime  accumulate. And, in this way, if you
were mold the face towards the cast, some grime  could be found
there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
to repair.
Vinegar  is better for moistening than wine . It is
necessary that the frame  be well smooth and even, otherwise
and that the cast be , as you press on one side, the other one
lifts.


This is why the press  is better, for it tightens evenly, &
more than your hands  , and makes

the lumpy sand , which is damp, communicate its humidity to the
soft & fine sand , which is sprinkled & poncé  dry
on the medal.


When you mold, always leave your medal in one of <add>the</add>frames , is <add>without stirring
it</add> because, if your cavity is not molded very neatly, you can put
it back in the right place by means of pegs , which will prevent
it from shifting. But, at first, ponce  yout medal with very
fine willow  charcoal , & se   next
clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release.
Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the
frame  & the sand.
</div><div>Bellows 
To melt with bellows , & hasten your fonte ,
& also cast hotter po  , do not place your
bellows  at the bottom near the foot of the furnace ,
for fear that some charcoal  might you  enters it, put
them almost under the grille  . It is good that your
bellow furnace  be in an aerated place  so that the
wind  might make it heat better, & that it be well dry
& and reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the furnace 
& that there is only entry of the tuelle  of the
bellows . And by the end, one ought to give it a good stoking,
since at the beginning you will blow gently.

making an ugly grimace. Let it dry & take your pattern to paint from
it
#  & swellings. It is necessary that it not be
too wet for the aforesaid reasons. Reheat little <add>by little</add>.
And if, after molding it, you leave it to dry slowly, in some dry
place  & not over a big fire, it would be better, for when one
exposes it all at once to intense heat, it warps. I believe that
reheating it at the mouth of the oven , after you have
taken the bread out , would be very proper. One ought not to
complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it withstands as many
castings as you wish, because it renders itself as hard as marble 
& you can polish it, & the mold  cannot be spoiled. Once
used, crush & sieve  it again, yet without being so
scrupulous as to render it very fine, I   for once
passed only through a common sieve , it has more force
than  and releases better, than when it is so fine.

Dissolve rock salt  or salt   finely

The sand from Thoulouse  , which is taken, from the
depths of the earth, from the small hill of Puy
David  , is excellent in itself, but to make it withstand
several castings, I mix it with pulverized sandever  &
moistened, which hardens it, & takes body & bond with it, &
makes it withstand more than five  as many castings as you
wish. Try to moisten the crushed glass   and other
e   sands with the waters of the above mentioned
salts . It wants to be, like all natural sand , well reheated
before putting it to use. One pulverises it, because it is in a lump,
then one reheats it in a copper  kettle  or similar thing,
until it no longer smokes.

It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It is rendered better for
casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used a lot, one
ought to refresh it with new sand.

attach to the oil . This worked very well and I molded a medal of
high relief very neatly, without making any stickiness, which a lot of
good sands, such as felt , burnt bone  & iron
dross , had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it & my
mold  became hard like marble , and I realized with this,
that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some
water , which gives them body & compactness, like egg
glair , gummed water , ea  wine boiled
with elm root  , & and lightly oil  the medal, it
withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as
glass . But even soft lead  & brittle tin v   want to be cast very hot.
Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is
excellent & endures many castings & molds very neatly, it is
however fat and makes things porous. This, soft lead and
the  does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a lean
sand , such as pumice , flakes , & similar things, to
give them body, & so that they release better. For lean sands 
barely release well and yet they receive metal  well.

Try to mix ceruse  or minium  with other sands.

proper thing, for this makes it mold better and release better. 

It would be good to fill the frame  all at once, for the

They should be of the finest material possible. In the same way, it
is better to use copper for a cauldron  than red copper ,
because it better resists a blow.
The mortars, therefore, used for grinding are stronger & there
is less danger of breaking them if they are of fine copper . And
for a private home, they do not ring so much & do not make as much
noise as those of metal . It is true that those that are of
metal  ring louder for apothecaries .

It wants to be well reheated for great metals . Some burn it
in the furnace  until it is very black, and grind it finely on

have body, and is too lean. You can give some with tripoly  or

Sand from a mine , well chosen & well reheated, is the most

<div> with the substance of a skillet  mixed with a knob that is
potin  . And before that, I had so reheated my molded
frame , now with the flame of my furnace , now putting
lit charcoals  on top of it, that it became almost red. I let it
cool and cast. It came out very neatly in relief on one side & in
cavity on the other, as well for the figure as the letters. It is true
that the material was whitish, as almost metallic, but this was because
of the potin  . I made another cast with substance of
skillet , alone in the same sand, but not so reheated, it did not
come out well.
Since then I molded the bone of oxen  feet, burned,
pulverized , & sieved  through a double sieve 
& hum  fort   moistened with
egg glair  or wine boiled with elm  root . I knocked
on it moderately while molding. Having undone the opened the
frame , I found that the figures had not released neatly &
left the molds  floury-like & crumbling. I
les   moistened the bone sand  further, so that
it stuck together well in the   between my
fingers  , and in this way, I molded neatly with a good
release. And even though it seemed to me that the pulverised bone 
was lumpy, if there is some substance of skillet  thrown in, my
figures came out very neatly. It is true that I had very very reheated
my frame , it withstood only one cast. I find  that
when a sand is so finely grounded that it renders itself dense as
ceruse  & even, like  without knowing it to be arid,
rarefied, areneux   & rather spongy, that it molds
very neatly, but it does not receive metal  so well, as if it were
porous to absorb the substance. But rather, once fat & even, it
becomes porous & does not receive fine lines. I believe that
the secret  to cast well lies in finding a sand that receives the
metal  well, one for lead , the other for another, for each
one has its particular one. Let it be molded slowly & carefully, and
leave it for a few days to become compact by itself, if you have the
time for this. And next, reheat it very well not all at once nor over
with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it crumbles &
always has some fault. Finally, you ought to cast the copper  or
latten  or other great metals  very hot, & if it
possible in large quantities of substance, which contain more heat than
small quantities. It is necessary that the frame  be cold, &
that you cast all at once. Always lute  the entrance of your
frame , for the metal , touching iron  or
metal ,

higher than the molded thing, because usually the sand, being reheated,
swells & if the par ce   in the middle,
& in this way, the molded thing remaining higher than the cast, the
metal  cannot run into it easily or enter at all. Also make sure
that the mold  & the cast are well reheated. Cast also all
at once & out of the wind . And if your medal is really
thin, put a card  , or two or three thicknesses of
paper   , underneath, when you want to mold it. In
this way the mold  will be lower than the cast. Cast also at the
place where your medal will be plus es   the least
thick & where there will be less relief.
</div><div>Excellent sand for lead , tin  and
copper 
D
Since then, I molded with burned bone , iron dross 
& burned felt , very pulverised & ground finely on
marble   and well mixed together. I moistened them very
well with beaten egg glair . And having covered the medal with it,
as in the others, then filled the frame  with sand from the
mine  , I knocked moderately. I found it to be of very good
release & molded very neatly. I let it sit all
night   long. The next morning , I reheated
it little by little, over the course of seven or eight
hours  (for if possible, no humidity ought to
remain  in the frame ). I cast twice in copper 
alloyed with ☾  , as old
K  . The substance came very beautiful, shiny,
& sonorous , & without a chappe , and my sand
was not corrupted at all. Since then, I have cast with it several casts
of soft lead  & tin , that came out better & more
neatly than any other that I have ever found.
When you mold, make certain lines around your mold , in the
frame , in order to attract the substance to all sides, in this
way.
 Potin  from seringue   & other
co  works, runs even better than fine latten .
But I think that it is better half copper  &
half latten , which have been used & have been in
very thin works, such as skillets & other similar things. I have
this mixture of half  and half  come out well.
 </div> 087r
<div> In order to mold well, one ought in a big frame  several
medals together, for when there is a lot of substance, & the
crucible  is almost full, it heats more, & then, if one
medal does not come out well, the other will be good.
It is better to melt in a bellows furnace  than in a
four à vent  , because it gives a more vigorous heat. It
is true that latten  melts well in the four à
vent  , because it is easier to melt than copper , being
more brittle.
Some of the founders   have this superstition,
that only three days a week  are good for melting, namely
Tuesdays , Wednesdays  Thursdays , and Saturdays . The others, for them,
are unlucky.
When you mold, do not knock excessively on the medal, which is in
the sand, because it prevents it from releasing very neatly, &
shakes loose the mold .
Take heed also that the sand does not surpass the edges of the
frame , for it makes the molded medal higher than the cast,
& in this way, metal  will never enter the mold. Therefore,
always make sure that the surface of your casted object directly lines
up with the mold , and to make this effect, if you wish, put a
lump of carton    of whatever thickness you
wish.
Founders  , in order to prevent their large cast
works from becoming porous, are careful to well reheat their molds. And
to know if they have been reheated enough, they knock against it with
their finger  , & if they ring  like a pot,
then they are.
To cast their canons neatly, they  mix their earth 
with some fine casting sand , if they can get any.

<div>Sand, slate , and burned earth 
Very burnt sand loses its bond. Slate  is reheated & molds
neatly. Next, it is true that often it becomes porous, like burned
earth  also does, like fat sand  also does.

I find that one ought not to knowck on very finely ground sands, for it
shakes them loose, & make  prevents them from releasing

</div><div>Sand from the mine  of Thoulouse  
 Casting sand coming from the mine , once passed through a
double sieve , next put in with melted resin , burns &
inflames & becomes all red & inflamed like iron . Once
cold it is completely black and can be ground very finely on
porphyry  . Thus having prepared it & render it
without asperity on the fingernail  , I moistened it
with beaten egg glair  & beat it well, until it was not pasty
but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, & molded with
it in lead  & tin  very neatly, but it wants to be well
reheated & at ease.
Others beat it well in a mortar , in small amounts at a
time, & thus it is pressed together and rendered very fine. Then
they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. After, they grind it dry on
porphyry  . And thus it becomes as if impalpable, and not
too dried out, it  and it retains body & bond of the
earth  to which it is related, and is better than when it is so
burnt. Once moistened with egg glair passed through a
sponge  , it releases very neatly M   very
neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore,
since then I have experimented lexper   with
moistening it only with quite strong vinegar . It released a
figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that,
moistening the finest in the same way like with glair  & the
lumpiest, to fill the chasses  with salt water  or
wine , that they do not ally so well. Since they are of the same
nature & are moistened the same, they embrace each other, & hold
together one with the other.
To mold well , after having prepared your sands, mold in
a day . Slowly reheat them the next day , then cast them
on another.



One ought to choose the one which is usually as  in clods
& lumps, well deep in the earth , for usually the one that
is found above  has too much earth , and the deep one is
similar to rock .

I have molded with it in pure lead  very neatly  hot,
& I had as an example the first very neat one, but the
vinegar  hardly gives it any bond, & thus it withstood only
one cast.

reworked them together on porphyry  , & passed them
through a double sieve  or through the sleeve of a
shirt  to mix them even better, I put them in paper  
& put them on a marble   in a cellar . After
one night  , they had been been moistened enough by
themselves without dampened them further, because rock salt , like
all other salts , dissolves in dampness . I molded very
neatly with it, because both were very finely ground. They want to be
f   humid enough to release well.
</div><div>Mineral sand
It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it
must be in one piece, & as if taken from a quarry  or
rock formation , & the deeper one takes it from, the
better. The signs of its goodness is that it is thus amassed, and that
when removing in the form of rock , it comes out in lumps &
qu   pieces which demonstrates its bond, & that it
is not too lean.
However, it should break apart between your
hands    & have very small
men   & delicate grains & of the same nature.
If it is not delicate enough, you can pass & grind it finely, either
through water , or through a sieve , & when
it  or on the porphyry  , & in this way, from
sil   leanness they become fat & well bound. You
can mold with it in a sa  frame  or in a
noyau  without cloth waste , & try it with
lead , for if with this one it does not become porous & casts
neatly, it will also behave well with copper . Some say that the
fat sands  do not want the metal  to be cast too hot.
Artisans who work on big works  & to save time, do not
need to grind & seek the curiosities of artificial sands ,
benefit from seeking some ready made in nature , which has the
finest grain possible, & for small works, they only pass it only
through a sieve . But those who work in small works, finely
grind it & grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of
it.

which releases more neatly than this one. It wants to be rather humid.
And if you want to cast very thin, make sure it is very hot. It came out
very neatly in soft tin , like the first one, and withstood
several casts. For tin , I believe that it is not necessary to
seek a better one, nor for fine lead  also, which comes out almost
as neatly as tin . Tou   the bone of the foot
of oxen   is always so lean on its own that, without being
mixed with one or two parts of some fat sand  &having bond

a cave  or in the serain    or, to
be done more quickly, in a piece of paper   between a wet
napkin . Take heed that it does not stay for too long, for it
would become so wet that it would not be good for molding in a
frame , but rather in a noyau , in which you will be
able to use it well as long as dries well at ease & far from the
fire. Otherwise the heat makes it swell, & push the salt  onto
the surface, which renders it lumpy. You can in  smear the
medal with spike lavender  oil , molding in
noyau . It is better to put in 4 ℥   of
sal ammoniac  per lb , and moisten it in a damp
place  for two or three days  , & so that
when you take fistfuls , it holds together, without, however,
attaching itself & being pasted to your hand  . You
will with it mold very neatly. But let it dry & reheat really well,
leaving the mold  inside, so that it acquires strength by
reheating, for it becomes hard as stone , & and in this way is
more certain to release well. Otherwise if you release before having
reheated it, there would be danger of it crumbling in some place,
because of its delicateness & fineness, even if the medal of high
relief. Once you have molded with it, pulverize it as before and put it
back in dampness .

All sand that releases well has body & sticks well. Ammoniac 
is fat and a va   however, is areneux  
which makes it release well. There is no better bond than salts
appropriate for metals , for once mixed in powder, they get moistened
together & dry &reheat together.

There is found in Cominge , near the town  of
Aurignac , a sand, white mai  , like
salt , and lean, that glassmakers  &
potters  use, which renders impalpable crushed on
porphyry   & is easy to crush. And once crushed, it
resembles calcined alabaster . It molds very neatly, and I have
not found any that molds as delicately as this one for low relief. It is
excellent to mold en noyau  without a frame, having crushed it
impalpable with gummed or pure water  on porphyry  ,
then placing it, thick as mustard  or a little more, on the medal,
smeared with a oil either olive , walnut , even
better spike lavender  . But to do it better
mo  , let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or
two days  . Although, if you are in a hurry, you can
heat it well, & it will not crack, if it is not put on too lightly.
It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes
some holes & bubbles, which it does not do when dried in the cold or
at ease, rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it & it will
withstand several casts.

Artisans who work in big works , & who need to further

use for grinding finely & for artificially preparing sands, seek
the one of the s  mine s  ,
which is not too fat, having some earth  in it, not too lean &
consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled from the
depths of the sand-bed  in mattons  & clods that show
its natural compactness, which is quite difficult to break & which
has a very small & delicate grain, & which is found soft
when handling it between your fingers   . And
because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous
areas , or lean territories  & having
arene  , it cannot be found in in the

preserves for them new space cos  for expanding,

<div>Grafting
Every tree that has coarser marrow, <add>the graft</add> is awkward

danger of wounding the marrow, & if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the vine , from all
peaches  & apricots .
Apricot trees  have a very thin bark, & thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of prune trees  & almond trees .
The grafts scarcely    take if the cut of the tree is
dampened. One needs then to graft in serain  & mild
weather, & not too cold & windy .
Old wood that one leaves to graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made & of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, & if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood than the young  better, because it is harder than
the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile & short & slow to
grow.
</div><div>Molding with cuttlefish  bone  
Guard against keeping them in a damp place , for they are
well prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the bone 
in two then even it out with a knife . And on a hooked
rooftile  , well dry &well smooth & covered with
pulverized willow  charcoal , rub & smooth the two
half bones  . Thus they absorb this willow 
charcoal , which makes them release them, guard against removing
anything. Then on a counter bone , that is to say a lump of
brick , smoothed to the size of your bone  , place
your medal, & then on this one, place the bone  ,
& press well with some other piece of the same size above. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, ponce  on top with
willow  charcoal  & blow gently, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole bones  . All cast work is brittle & subject to
breaking, because the metal  expands when cast, & retracts
& condenses when hammered . That is why, one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a chisel , & in this way the
metal  retracts, and let it thus escrouir . If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the mold  & the
cavity with a pen-knife , to make way for the medal & then
mold. And if the medal has two sides

wood  , pierce them, or ma   coat the
joinings with some clay , & dry. Press between them 
your hands  joined between your two  knees ;
& not with a press , because the bones   would
burst. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see
that it is well pressed tightly together & well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, ponce  with some
willow  charcoal , for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with oil  & with willow 
charcoal powder  & with a brush , to make it dull. Guard
against your medal being too greasy or oily , when you mold in
cuttlefish  bone  . When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some bone  . And, cast moderately hot,
something you will know when the bone   is about to change
its good  whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes
the bone   red. The proportion  of lead 
& tin  is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out, & of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or
four grooves, and make  & direct these grooves to the
place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like
directly on the head, for this attracts the metal  & absorbs
the figure best. Shake your frame  a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. Tin  that is too
hot burns the bone  , which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out du mo  hot from the mold , it risks
breaking.

<div>Sand Mixture easy to melt
One ℥  de  part soft tin , one part fine lead , one part looking glass tin  & one part argent vif
arresté   makes an alloy & a solder , so easy to melt
that it can easily be melted in a dish of fine tin  .
</div><div>Molding a cavity on one side and in relief on the other
And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine tin , which is
harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves
it in one half of the frame , & presses it a little so that
it holds better. And next, you will cast in your frame  some
solder  described above, or another more meltable than fine
tin . And thus, the second medal will melt & mold itself on the
first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix
some lamp black  with water , & with a
pinceau  , give a light coat of this to the medal, which
remains in the frame , & leave to dry. Thus it will not
melt.
But if you have a medal of copper  or silver , you can
leave it in the cast, if you want to cast with lead  or
tin . But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold
would make the tin  contract.
Tin  wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.
Soft tin  , which is the best for the cast, is the
one that, once cast en grille  , is burnished
&  shiny & polished like a mirror, & appears to have
been burnished. And has have holes like the one that is brittle, &
that is not shiny, as if burnished.
</div><div>Potin 
Potin , once cast hot, runs & flows like tin . But
the medal becomes whitish from this, and immediately pushes the
verd   to the surface, which good substances do not
do.

Or else, melt 4 ℥   of tin , & as
it cools, purify it of its filth , which is on top, then, make a
hole in it & put in there i ℥   of
☿   & it will come out like tin  if you
remelt it, but it will be breakable. And If you want to assay if it is
tin  or ☿  , redden a shovel  &
put a small lump of your ingot on top. If it is tin , it will melt
& stay, but if it is ☿  , will quickly melt,
then when crackling well, it will evaporate. One ought to congeal it in
a spoon  or in a hollow crucible , & make a
moderately sized hole.
It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in aqua
fortis   which beforehand will have eaten a little silver .
This one, mixed, makes tin  & lead  run.
</div><div>Mixture
Fine tin , congealed mercury  with the smell of

one as the other , makes a substance that melts very quickly, but
breakable & white. I think that it would be good for solder .

<div>Olives 
They are spoiled if once per month   one does not

That when the first flowers fall les suiv   &

</div><div>Grafts
It is necessary that the graft not be from old wood for it is never
a beautiful tree.
One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, & it
does not have enough strength for taking cuttings.
Trees which have coarse marrow, like peach trees  & all
their kind &the plum trees , do not want grafts in
freezing weather  because the cold damages their marrow, which one
also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
graft.
All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree will be sapping,
for the humor  grows them quickly. Otherwise
au  , they dry too quickly that the humor  of
the sap does not grow them.

Finely pulverized quicklime  works. The same for broken up

<div>Faces in distemper 
Because colors in distemper  dry quickly & one would not
have leisure to perfect the shadows & touches on the face, one wets
the reverse of the face which is on canvas  with a wet
sponge . Then, with a small pinceau  , one makes
the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
areas. And with another pinceau   one does the shadows
<add>again</add> by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
because they are made of bistre , which stains the canvas 
like rust . The said bistre  is good with  for
making shadows in distemper mix , for in oil  it
has no body & would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in
the said bistre , for shadow, ocre de ru   & a
little sap green . The best bistre  is the greasy &
shiny kind from the fireplaces of large kitchens . It is
difficult to grind & screeches on the marble  .
</div><div>Azure 
Azur d’esmail   always wants to be cleaned because the
filth that can be seen in the laveures  makes it die. One needs
to coat it two times, & the first very thick, moving the
pinceau   by laying it first lengthwise then across.
  It is better used on canvas , where it is imbibed
immediately, than on wood . Varnish  returns it to its
vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it,
painters  bring their palette  to the
grocers , & distemper & alloy it with a little white
ground in oil , for in this way, the beautiful shows its
turquine  vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
delicate is the best for working. It is thinned working  by
washing it.
</div><div>Violet and lake 
It is made of azure  & lake  which is also assayed
on the palette  with white. It is deemed beautiful that which
which, on a polished knife  or on glass   gives a
clear red  color of red rose, tending a little towards violet.
The kind which is blac  dark red is not as pleasant.
</div> 094r
<div>Furbisher 
The parts of a sword are the tang, the tail of the sword, what comes
next is the quillon block, the rest is the blade. The sides are the edge
& the point. Some blades have a sharp ridge, which has one single
elevated ridge in the middle & along the whole length, and are easy
to break. The other blades are called of three edges or three slopes,
which do have a rise in the middle, but it is flat as if it were a sharp
ridge, but flattened, and s   these ones are the
safest. The others are  are called fluted, which are notched
in the middle, & when it is along the whole length, they are just as
easy to break as those with sharp ridges & are more troublesome to
furbish because the fustée  cannot get in. But one makes one in
particular which is narrow.
Of the guard of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the guard
& the pontet , which is this iron  strip which closes
off the branch which is at the end of the quillon-block to stop thrusts
from sliding into the guard. The rings are these two branches in
half-round which start from the eye of the guard up to the branch of the
pontet . The branch that crosses the guard is called the body.
And this escusson , by which the sword tail enters and to which
all the branches return & are held, is called the eye of the
guard.
Then follows the wood  of the grip which one glue s, or
according to the most competent, with gummed wax  which is of
wax  & pitch , because resin  would be too hard.
They heat it lightly, then rub the wood  of the grip with it in
order that the tang or the thread take hold there. Otherwise, if a
thread  were to come loose, it would all d  
break immediately. On iron  wire or dog skin , one also puts
glue  on it. The garnishment of  which is put on the
wood of , which is of silk  or thread , is
called the cord, which is made from two thr  or three
threads  twisted  twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if
the silk  is thin. The slightly bigger cord holds better. The
binding, which is also made of silk  at both ends of the handle,
are called the buttons.
Some grips are made of silk , dogfish skin , annealed
iron  wire, threads of gold  & of fine &
false silver  & of velvet . Iron  wire has a lower
price & is the most durable. Next is the grip of silk , if one
does not have the convenience of being close to the sea to procure some
dogfish skin , which is quite convenient. To  The
beautiful skin  costs fifty or lx sous   & 4
or five dozen grips are made from it. This kind gives a good grip even
if the hand is sweating. To work it, if it is too hard, one soaks it for
one or two hours in not quite lukewarm aquafortis , for if it were
too hot, it would cook & spoil the skin . It is sewn with
black thread .
  </div> 094v
<div> The gold  grips are made by putting underneath thin yellow
canvas  or a different canvas yellowed with chalk . And this
canvas  is set with glue  or the aforesaid gum , this
is in order that the thread  holds better on it. These are made of
cords like the silk  ones & between two cords one sets one or
two threads  to make it show up better. The silver  kind is
made similarly, and there is not as much trouble as with silk ,
and even less because it takes more to twist silk , because one
needs to twist it twice. A grip of fine gold  is worth 18 or 20
sols  .
The best sword point is the sage leaf  form.
This long plank on which the sword is attached & laid down to
furbish it is called the chameau , it is commonly of
rowan  which is hard & even.
The lower stick which is folded like a bow is called the
arson .
The upper is called the stick of the fustée .
And this small square piece, which is pu  t
l  on the sword to burnish it, is called the
fustée .
There are two horns: one is called the oil  horn and the other
the emery  horn. 
There is an iron  which is made like a halberd point, square,
& of very even steel , & well filed, which is called the
grateau  which serves to to  soften the traces of the
file on sword guards & to give an edge to swords after they have
been milled, which is better than with a stone  or a
coux  , which quite often makes scratches.
To make coupp   swords cut better, one gives them
the edge by pulling upwards from the point.
Those who create sword guards  are artisans separate from
the furbisher .
 A is the bruisson <lb/>


B is the bloodstone
The fustée  is a square piece of wood three fingers in
thickness, of boxwood , which is fitted in the middle of the stick

<div> The furbisher  buys his blades by the dozen which are not
fully drawn by the tang because he does this himself to adjust them them
well to the pommel & guards.
Spanish ones are deemed better for being of better steel 
& iron  but they are not as well-forged as swords from Vienne
in pro   Dauphiné. The Spanish ones are not as well
ground coming from the forge because they grind them with the foot &
this is what makes them wavy.
Blades from Vienne commonly cost xviii or 19 lb. a dozen.
The first thing the furbisher  does when he gets his new
blades is to draw out their tang, which he does himself, or has done by
locksmiths  or farriers , giving him some
liard  for his charcoal . Next they pass it over a
grindstone to make it cut, then lay it down on the
chameau ,  and with some pulverized emery , fine
& soft as flour, & mixed with oil  to make it hold, they
furbish the sword with the stick used to remove the traces of the
grindstone and then the  clean po   the
sword well with the emery , and give it a drop or two of
oil  which they spread with the finger to give it luster. Having
put the oil , they furnish the sword again on the chameau 
with the felin  which is a thunderstone mounted in the middle of
a stick like the fustée , and this stick is called the baton
à felinder . Next, having passed it on the felin , they
furbish it with chalk  & the oil  which is on the sword.
After they wipe it & go over it again, & furbish with dry
chalk . And at the end, when they are ready mounted, one gives
them the edge with the gratteau . Ai  
Once furbished, one mounts it on the guards which one presents to
know if they are quite suitable. And taking hold of a blade such that
the whole quillon block is held in the hand, one conjectures that it
will be just as heavy once mounted.
One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of wood , then
with a file they enlarge the opening of the guard if it is necessary.
Then to rivet it, one places on the tang a piece of  & the
pommel a piece of wood  & with a hammer, one beats on it to
align & secure the pommel well. Then with the hammer, one works the
tang when the hammer is well secured & does not wobble. The
wood  is put there so as not to spoil the pommel. Next, one fits
the tang with a file or chisel. And some make the b  
the tang in a square diamond-shape but it is not as good as the round
one, for when faceted, the tang breaks.
 </div> 095v
<div> The end is bought ready-made by the dozen which costs of six
sols   for the small ones, but for the the big ones 2
caroli  .The end this  is put either with
nails which are put on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only
spoils the sword & destroys the scabbard because the water enters
through the join of the nail. It is best to apply resin  or
glue  on it, but the resin  is better. And it is best is
when the end is well adjusted & set so hot that the pulverized
resin  melts on the end. In this way, it does not fall and cannot
be undone unless it is put in the fire.
Guards are of several kinds:<lb/>


Worked<lb/>


Guttered which is with round mouldings<lb/>


Pearled<lb/>


Scarfed when the bands are crosswise<lb/>


Onioned which is with a flat head<lb/>


In the King's manner, which are plain
The furbishers  buy them by dozens, the dozen of plain
ones commonly costs x lb. The worked piece, 30 sols   or
depending on its style.
The first thing the apprentice  does is to furbish as
said.
And next to garnish the sword & make a scabbard which is the
height of the art.
They buy wood  pieces for scabbards which are ready made, of
beech wood , a hundred for xv or xx or 30 sols , depending
on the distance to the place where they are made.
Theses wood  pieces are thus called estelles , and
have to be very neat & without any knots & are one finger’s
thickness across.
Then the furbisher  puts them on a small bench, called a
scabbard bench and with a a plane  small iron  tool
similar to that of the joiners ' bench, they hold it firmly.
Then with a plane  plane which is like a knife with two
handles, one works the wood  roughly from the top, next one passes
the joiner 's plane on it the better to even it. Next, one
scours it on the inside with a
 </div> 096r
<div> 

round plane , also mounted with two handles, then with a small
narrow plane , one hollows & scrapes it half a foot towards
the end of the talan , and the shorter the better. Without this
scraping, the sword would always cut the scabbard.


The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth & on top is the
shape of the blade.


The stop, which is a leather  rim set on the edge of the blade
shape is made to stop the hangers.


When the estelles  are well levelled, one lays the sword on top
& with a black stone  one marks the width of the blade,
& the length, & then with a chisel  one cuts the excess.
And one passes a joiner’s plane  to even it well, according to
the mark.


Next, one glues the two estelles  edge to edge <add>and all
around</add> only as far as the shape of the blade extends & not
elsewhere. And this is to make the leather  or velvet  of
the scabbard hold.


Then one puts the sword into the estelles . And precisely thus
they set it in the scabbard which is all sewn, and rub what is glued
along the shape of the blade with tallow  to make it run into the
scabbard.


The scabbard is made of calf  or sheep leather ,
the calf  ones are in all one piece, but not the sheep 
ones. But, when the swords are long, one makes them in pieces which are
sewn between leather  & flesh , & then they rub the
stitching thoroughly with a piece of boxwood  to cover & even
it. From a good calf skin , viii or 9 or x scabbards can
be taken, from a sheep skin , v or vi. A
workman  can easily make vi a day. If they are too thick, one
thins them a little with a plane. If the skin  is hard, one wets
it in lightly lukewarm water , and one does not leave it there for
long. Next, the same worker who made the wood  piece has to adjust
the scabbard to be well made. It is true that for common people, one may
well get ones which are ready made, but they are never carried as well.
When the scabbard is made & sewed with black thread , one rubs
it with a piece of boxwood  or with a linen cloth, having daubed
it a little in oil . The scabbard of a good cow  is better
than any and also costs more, except the velvet  kind. Under the
velvet  one commonly puts plain canvas  or a sheep 
scabbard or a parchment  cover. But the best scabbard of all is a
waxed scabbard, of either velvet  or calf . It is because
one covers the wood with thin canvas, which one next waxes, then one
covers it in velvet  or calf . A waxed  scabbard is
worth at least xxx sols  , a cow  one xx
sols  .

<div>Grey guards
Once they are white, one only needs to clean we  them
well, then put them in the fire, & make them pass to blue. And one
needs to take good care that they do not pass too far beyond blue, for
neither gold nor silver nor any color would take on it. To do this,
which is called making them pass, one takes a cauldron full of
ashes   which one covers with thoroughly lit charcoal, &
thus one heats them quite strongly for an hour   or
two, and when the ashes  are very hot, one pulls the charcoal to
one side & one puts the guard where the charcoal was, & one
covers it completely with ashes . And when the body of the guard,
which is the main thing, is completely passed, one rotates the guard
onto the other side, and in this manner, the grey cannot pass too much,
unless some hot charcoal  touches it. The grey can be done well in
the <add>ordinary</add> fire in the fireplace , but there is a
danger that it may pass too much & produce filth  which will
prevent it from taking color. Blue is obtained as soon as the ash 
has heated the guards a little, but it is still grey in some places.
After blue comes grey.
</div><div>Color of water
<add>For</add> the color of water, one passes a soft file 
on the guards to whiten them, then the burnisher . Next, one
makes them pass to blue until they turn grey. Next, when they are still
moderately hot, one passes the bloodstone  over them, and when
they cool, one turns them to reheat them, for the color of water is made
only in several passes. And if the guards were not warm, the
bloodstone  would scrape & undo the color. One needs to take
heed that guards do not pass too far beyond grey, for they would throw
off filth that would prevent the color from taking. One needs almost one
day   for preparing, softening, & setting the
color of water, but as they pass a little beyond blue, it is enough for
grey & another color. Grey is the lesser color after varnish 
which is of two colors, either yellow or black.
</div><div>Yellow varnish 
One whitens very strongly & one cleans the guards well. Next,
one applies walnut olive   oil  all
over them with a feather  while they are cold, and next one
needs to  turn them over a good charcoal  fire that is on the
furbishers ' furnace , without them touching the
charcoal  or the ash . And when they do not smoke anymore,
it is done.
</div> 097r
<div>Black varnish 
It is said, at the beginning of the book where you can see it, that
it is made with galipot .


</div><div>Gilding
One prepares the guards thoroughly with a very soft soft
file  such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards,
and next one needs to  heat them, & pass them as is said.
But to gild & gild with silver , they ought not to pass more
than a little beyond blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches
them to a vice & with some tweezers  one layers the
gold  & one sets it with bloodstone ,which is quite
clean & rubbed with pottée  . And when the guards are
cold, one reheats them, then one layers the gold  as above. And
first one gives of  two layers, until the entire guard is
well-garnished. And next one reheats as at the beginning, & one
gives the third covering of gold . Then one burnishes very
thoroughly & with great force with a large bloodstone .
And  But note that <add>to</add> burnish well, the guard
always needs to be warm. And to know this, one smells it &
brings it close to the nose  . For one ought not to touch it
with the fingers , but one holds it on  lifts it from
on top of the warm ashes  with a small iron  rod ,
which has been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when
it is completely well-burnished, one rubs it very well with a
white linen cloth  , and the gold  needs to be
thicker & stronger than for painters . A quarter
pound  is worth fifty or LX sols  .
</div><div>Gilding with silver 
One needs to prepare the guards & whiten them with a
lince   file , a little coarser
for  than for gold . And one makes them pass beyond
grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
silver foil , then separate it with a knife , next apply
it to the guard, with a small  tweezers 
& a small burnisher . And then reheat & apply until they
are all gilt with silver . Next one needs to cover them for the
third time, with the doubled foil as has been said, then burnish them
very well & with force, not with the bloodstone , but with a
strong burnisher . Just as the burnisher  ought not to
burnish gold .

<div>Mastic varnish  dry in a half
hour  


Some take 2 ℥   of mastic , half
℥   of turpentine  & half
℥   of turpentine oil  & eau de
vye , a little at your discretion, because it evaporates when heated
& nonetheless makes the varnish  more desiccative. But I made
it thus: I take turpentine oil  at discretion & put in a good
bit of turpentine , because it remains always moist & attaches
itself if one puts in too much, & eau de vye , & heat in a
varnished bowl  the said oil , & when it begins to be
very hot, I put in some subtly ground mastic  & around
one-third  of the oil  passed through a sieve l , and let reheat until it is melted, which will be soon on
hot ashes . Once all melted, try it on the knife , and if
you see that it has too much body, add in a little turpentine
oil , and if it does not have enough, add in mastic , and thus
it well be done. And keep it well covered so that no filth gets in. When
you want to make it, be careful to sort & choose the mastic 
that is white & purified of any dirt & dust & black dross.
And when you wash it & dry it to render it very white & clean,
it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these
straws   & marks, pulverised into it, will remain
within the varnish , & when you set it on white or carnation,
it will appear that they are fleas  & blemishes. Once well
chosen, pulverise it in a mortar  and pass it through a very
fine sieve , and next mix it in oil , as is said. But if you
want to make it more carefully, extract a tear of mastic , as you
know, pulverise, pass, & mix, and you will have something very
singular for small works. Take heed when varnishing not to breathe on
it, for this will make the varnish  whiten & take body.


It almost dries when working.


One knows that this varnish  does not have body enough when it
does not take well on a panel in oil  for it is like water .
Add in therefore pulverized mastic  & heat until it is good.
This varnish  is very white & beautiful, & does not go to
your head like that of spike lavender  .


For some, instead of tour  turpentine oil , put
spike lavender  oil , which is not as good.


This varnish  is laid down cold on the panel with a very clean
fingertip  , & one needs to spread it
vigorously.


The Italians  scarcely varnish their paintings because they lay
their paintings very thick & they are a long time  drying
on the inside, though on top they make a dry skin & crust.


One lays the varnish  with a finger   so as make a
lean layer, because when thick, it yellows.

of a pruning knife , in order that the chalked cord 
marks a straight line, the length  of which you will un

</div><div>Locksmith 
To well tin  nails and other work, they file  their
work very neatly. Then to clean it well & rid it of fattiness, they
make it boil in vinegar , then they wipe it well with a
linen   . Next they heat it & pass some
resin  over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
varnish . This done, they melt some pure & fine tin  in
their estamiere  , which is a little square iron 
box. And when the tin  is well melted & moderately warm, they
throw in resin  in to burn the filth, & then they let the
head of a nail  or something similar soak a little, & having
remained there for seven or eight pauses  , they take
it out and shake it, hitting the top with an iron   to
make the tin  that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a
small stick wrapped in tow  . And if it is not well
tinned , you will hit it hot with a piece of resin  & do
as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
which is a sign that the tin  is the right temperature. But it
becomes blue if the tin  is too hot. Things t  
thus tinned  are durable & are not undone like tinning done
in leaf , thus at the end of a year  they can be clarified
& renewed by heating & rubbing them.
Leadsmiths  say that making a lizard  die in the
melted il des  tin  makes the tinning

fills with brine . Then one serves them all
year  , among salads, raw with oil  & vinegar ,
for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test
your brine  with an egg  for if it is good & and strong
enough, the egg  will float on top. If not, it is not strong
enough and would not preserve the fruits .
</div><div>Trees
Which bear fruits quickly are aged and scarcely last.
</div><div>Birds 
Which have been fed by the rod  do not whistle among the
company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them
well to whistle, one needs to take them from the nest before they can
see & cover them with down  or a hare skin . Thus,
having not seen their father and known his voice, they learn the whistle
that one teaches them better.
</div><div>Fonte 
The potée   is made of burnt earth  which was
used in the fonte , this is earth bourre bolvene  
in which one has melted it. One grinds it on a big
stone  , & with this one one makes the
chappe  of  first coat of the chappe  of
bells, where there are letters & works, & le  
only needs to be reheated in the flame of a straw , and mold very
neatly.
The earth  which molds in noyau  is subject to making
it porous, if you do not rub well with a brush  or your
finger   on the molded piece, which should be well
oiled . And do it coat by coat, & not all at once.
 </div> 099r
<div> Earth , or sand, moistened or ground with water , wants
to be reheated more than sand.
Latten from a candlestick  is not pure, for one mixes in it
iron filings  & potin .
Latten  wants to be cast hotter than copper , quod
non credo .
One ought not, to cast carefully, to take metals already
alloyed , but take them pure & mix them.
Iron  hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of
copper  or latten .
It is better all with a sand, either in a frame  or
noyau  at once, rather than several mixed.


One ought to reheat for one or two hours  et
p  , in <add>that a</add>charcoal  fire which
lights by itself, a crucible  with the substance inside, and
then blow & cover the crucible  with large charcoals 
& the mouth of the furnace  with bricks  , and
let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal , which
se   fill the furnace  above the
crucible . In the end feed and stoke the fire, & when the
flame is very white & that the substance will be in a liquid
bain  like water  & casting off pale blue flames,
cast. The secret is to cast <add>very</add> hot & in one go.
</div><div>Lean white sand 
Without bond renders well proper for casting, & having body, if
you grind it very finely on porphyry   or calcine it,
reddening it several times in the fire, & spread it in
vinegar  or finely grind it with water , as you know. It
also molds very neatly in noyau , as I have experimented. But do
not moisten it with salt water  if you want to quickly reheat it,
for salt  boils on the fire & makes bubbles, being pressed by
the fire. I believe that the noyau , gently reheated, would not
do this. I molded very neatly in noyau  the substance of
skillets . White sand smells like sulphur   when
reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been
cast in it, it acquires in the mold comm e   a luster as if it were
leaded  or vitrified. I believe that glassmakers  could
use it.


One needs very little of sal ammoniac  dissolved in
water .
</div><div>Bell handles


They can be put back on, without remaking the bell, which one ought to
put back in the pit, & and mold it there. But should you
solder  a ref   cracked bell, it is considered

<div>Quince trees 
They want to be pruned often, otherwise they die & do not bear
fruit so beautiful.
</div><div>Cannons
They are very difficult to drill when they are made of metal 
since the material is rough and brittle. But you must not push the drill
too strongly or push all at once, but remove it often. In that case, the
cannon mouth is bigger than the bullet in order to avoid drilling, since
the material can be easily cast and slides. The drill should not be like
a dovetail, or a point, but should be cut in round like a crankshaft. If
it breaks, don't leave it to rust + 
+  but instantly take it off from the light. What you
will do is pour a little oil  on it and then turn it down opposite
to the light, strike the opposite side, and it will fall out. You have
to drill gently when a piece is made of metal.

One does not make them in the pit if they do not fit.
</div><div>Gilding your  molding for panels without
gold 
Some take orpiment in leaf form  & pulverize it & make
moresque  leaves & burnish it, and it is this
orpiment  which is shiny like gold . However, ground
metals  or ground cristallin   or touchstone  are
better.
</div><div>Orpiment  orange
One sublimates it & one grinds it & some put in a little

dregs.

<div>Gold color
To quickly make a layer of or sur  
mat   on canvas  or other oil panel , one makes fatty
walnut  oil in the sun  or on the
fire , as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way,
although there is neither lead , nor ceruse . And with this,
grind massicot  , mine , & other desiccatives,
not verdet   nor orpiment , for they cause the
gold  to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the
weather is not clear & dry  , do not shade it,
for if the weather is damp & humid  , it would
turn black.
</div><div>Portrait-painting from nature
One needs to carefully observe  the eyes, the nose, &

Being melted with pebbles , it makes the glass  very white.
But before, one needs to calcine it on a hot tile or coal
shovel . And that which will remain from the vapor, mix it as
much of the white calcined pebbles  . It is true that, in the
little furnace , it is not clarified well. But for large
glass , it makes the glass  very clear & white &
clean.
</div><div>Windows through which the sun  will not pass
Take the aforementioned calcined saltpeter  & expose it to
a humid air or place , and it will convert itself into a
liquid which, if rubbed <add>on both sides</add> of the windows, the
sun  will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One
needs to put the saltpeter  on some clean thing <add>place</add>, & it  put glowing coals  on it,
and continue all over until it no longer burns.


It also serves for melting & for adding in with alkali salt 
for cleaning hands .
</div> 100v
<div>Gemstone 
Take white pebbles that are found by the rivers  &
among the sand bank , & paths , which are
somewhat transparent , & if they are perfectly transparent it
will be better. If not use the best & whitest that you can. Calcine
them three or 4 times in your four à vent   & quench
them in water  or vinegar . Next, take a
℥   of them and pestle  them in a
totally pure copper  mortar , & with a pestle of
pure copper  , and grind them until they become very fine
& soft powder, and this is a sign that they have taken the substance
ofcopper ,enough for giving them greenness. At that time, on your
℥   of pebbles , put in three
℥   of good minium, not adulterated by
brick  & anything else, and grind everything together again very
well in a bronze  mortar . And on all of this, put in a
gros  <add>pour
℥   </add> of sel de verre  ;
& some & the common people  put in
e  sandever  that they find at the
glassmakers  or apothecaries . But alkali
salt , as you know, is better.

In this way, the common people  make emeralds & cast in
sand. If you do not have a bronze  mortar , grind

One needs to reheat crucibles  before putting in materials, and

</div><div>For ruby  take some gold leaf 
Raise your furnace by two tiles   all
around, because one needs more heat for making rubies  than for
emeralds . And take one ℥   of white
calcined pebbles  and put it in a mortar of glass  ;
& having ground it coarsely with the pestle  of the same,
mix in grain    the weight of a

times then beaten into leaf.

<div> again very well, then add in iii ℥   of
minium , & pestle  well again all together, & put
it in the crucible , which you will cover with an appropriate
tile , a bit thick, in order that heat reverberates better
there. Then set it on the grill  of your furnace ,
having put under a few thick rounded squares . Next, fill your
furnace  to the opening with charcoal , so that it will
be heaped, and leave it glowing, and always maintain the heat evenly
without letting the charcoal  decrease. And for this effect,
always make so that the furnace  is heaped & full of
charcoal , and maintain it thus for one day  .
The first experience that I made thus, it only returned a yellow mass,
as is only vitrified minium , & some grains  of
gold   in a mass at the bottom. Try soldered gold 
and accompanied with antimony  .


If you need greater heat, plie   put on the edge of
the opening of the glowing furnace tiles , one against
the other, for making the heat reverberate.
 </div><div>Topaz 
The same dose  is observed for all gemstones , namely
one weight of calcined pebbles  on three of
minium  , pestling  all separately in a
copper  mortar  for emerald , & in an
iron  mortar  for making topaz  or amber 
color, with pestles  identical to the mortars . The
emerald  & the topaz  are of the same heat, & for an
hour & a half   on the fire, for they could burn.
The ruby en   wants more time & more fire
& colored with gold leaf . I believe that pumice stone 
or firestone  for the ruby  would be better. See the
enamels . Try also mixing, in place of pebbles , pieces of
colored glass  or enamels . If the mass is not colored
enough, pestle  it more in the iron  mortar .
Slightly burnt tartar  mixed among this makes beautiful yellow,
but one scarcely needs much. The arene   also makes it
more yellow.
</div><div>Salt  for melting
Mix saltpeter  & common salt  and melt them together
& cast on melted copper  or ch   in a
bain , & it purifies & makes it run marvellously. First,
one ought to decrepitate  the common salt , that is to say
holding it over a good fire until it no longer crackles or, to melt it
better, in an four à vent  . And throw it neatly on
marble  , then crush it & grind it very finely, then
put it in a crucible  on as much saltpeter  &
let it boil, & mix them together until


It cleans & purifies metal  well.

For grafting en escusson , one needs to take the new output
that the tree that you want to graft made in that year , &
there cut a branch on which you see that, next to
raci   the sprouting of leaves there are little
buttons that one calls oeillets , which are the beginnings of
sprouts. One needs to nimbly, with a very sharp pen-knife , cut
in the shape of a shield a little bit of the skin with  which
contains an oeillet  or sprout with the leaf, thus marked B.
But plustot   Then carefully make on the
tender wood s   which is full of sap, on which you
want to graft, two lines thus de   cut  , then
make in the middle a cleft thus

 

. Next separate with the point of the pen-knife  the bark &
open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your
shield so that nothing comes out but the sprout, bind it well & wrap
it entirely with a slip of linen    or very
soft thread  , so that there is nothing uncovered but the leaf,
which in three or 4 days   will give you an indication
whether the shield should take, accordingly it will be green. Leave your
graft seven or eight days   thus, then unbind it &
join it well to the bark, especially at the sprout, & then rebind
all gently but not as strongly as before; & if there is any output
or growth, leave it space to go out; & do thus three or 4
times.
  </div> 105v
<div> Next, when it will be well b   taken, cut the top
of the tree that exceeds your tree, ne   three or 4
fingers   above the shield for the first time, and
apr   then, at the closest point, in order that is
closed. But heed well that when you will make your shield no small hole
remains at the back of the sprout, for this would signify to you that
its root would be broken, & your graft would never take; but make it
so that the back is intact. This type of grafting is practiced
from mid-May  , so that the trees have already budded
& made new output, until the beginning of
August  , and so that the trees are in sap. Almond
trees , which are naturally drier, lose their sap earlier, therefore
those who want to graft onto them mericotons  ,
apricots  & grafts of trees with pitted fruit, which are the
best there, they are grafted in the month of
January  . Generally trees with pitted fruit, like
mericoton  peaches , are grafted in clefts. One says
that trees de   grafted en piolet  or
escusson  are later to bear fruit than those en

it very thinly & finely.
</div><div><add>Making gold  run</add> for casting
Because gold  cools down very quickly, one ought to give it a
mix when melted q   it is well melted which maintains
the heat. Sublimate  softens it nicely. But, because it goes up in
smoke, it does not continue to help. Therefore mix this composition when
you want to cast: sal ammoniac , the best verdet  
that you can find, a little borax  & saltpeter <add>qui li </add> . And this, by keeping it warm, it
will come out neatly. <add>Saltpeter  clarifies it &
p   heats it. But the most important thing in this
mixture is the verdet  , which has to be good. This
mixture softens the gold qui   so much that it
becomes treatable like lead , even fine gold .</add>
For sand for molding flowers & leaves & delicate things, mix
in well-ground raw plaster , brick  & alum de
plume  .
To moisten sands, eau de vye   is excellent, for it
grinds the sand finely & evaporates que   when one
reheats the frames .
Sal ammoniac water  is very good, is excellent for moistening
sands, but for lots of water  one only needs a little sal
ammoniac .
A lump of iron , for lack of crocum ferri  , is
exce   good for gold .
The snakes  or lizards  you want to mold should not
be kept for a long time , for if they are alive, they get
thin, and if they are dry il   dead, they wither.
Plaster of Paris   is as firm as stone  &
very good. When you will want to choose some for your sand, take it raw,
the hardest possible & which does not make any powder. The
transparent one and the one that thusly makes powder retracts,
Ce   which is not good for this work. A sign of the
one that is close to perfection is that it is hard & made of
lustrous grains nearing the shape of sugar . Finally, to mix some
into the sand to cast gold , it is necessary that it endures the
fire twice, & is reheated twice.
+  When gold  is very fine, it is so dry that it
can hardly endure a hammer , but this mixture softens it like
lead .
</div> 106v
<div>Casting in gold 
To cast in gold , il f  crocum
ferri   is necessary, <add>& more alum de
plume   than in the following mixture. The alum de
plume   mixture cannot corrupt anything. The mold  needs
to be red & press it promptly with iron 
presses .</add>
The shell of crabs  & crayfish   are
uneasy to burn & there is a proper way of molding them.
Rats  & birds  can be molded, and the feet are
uneasy to extract, when burnt, because they are small & delicate.
The bodies are extracted more easily from the mold . The feet
are cast in many times  pieces.
Tiles  

Those of the houses  that are not sandy seem to withstand fire
better.
Tiles  with which one covers houses , the hardest
& firmest and recleansed of stones  & large gravel ,
are used to p   mix in with the sand
et   for molding. But, before, it is necessary to heat
them just until they have been well red for one or two
hours  , & pestle them & pass them finely
through a sieve .
The little turtles , having just come out of the egg, are
very nice to mold.
<add>If the plaster  is mixed with some dust  or is not the
hard kind, it bursts in the fire & causes flaws.</add>
The hardest plaster  , as was said, is the best
being from stone , therefore take it raw of this kind. Crush it
bien  <add>plus </add> as finely as possible
and pass it through the finest sieve  or sleeve  that
you can. Being thusly p  <add>b</add> fine, put it,
<add>in a good amount </add>, in a cauldron  or
skillet  over an open flame, & as it begins to heat up, stir
it continuously, and heavy & lumpy as it is, it will become so light
& so handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance
to handling <add>stirring</add>, as if it was water .
Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy
& dense, and that is the sign it is cooked. <add>But do not reheat
it until your brick  and alum de plume   are
reheated & your clay  circles are done. For it needs to be the
last one reheated & when all the rest is ready, for the less
plaster # </add>
#  remains reheated, & plus   the
quickest it is put to use, that is the best, for it sets more quickly.
One ought not reheat it until you want to mold. And to reheat it, put
it, as finely ground raw powder, in a cauldron  on
ash  a clear flame & do not make it neither too strong nor
too violent. Always stir with a long stick , to avoid the vapor,
turning it around the cauldron  & in the middle, in a figure
8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy difficult  to
stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to
throw off some bubbles at the edge of the cauldron . And finally
it will become like liquid & mealy & like bran & boiling in
the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it
has once again become heavy



ʘʘ 
Alum de plume    is the one that gives good
binding to sand.
Crocum ferri    is appropriate for
gold . It is it, once mixed within the sand, that receives it
& holds it within its warmth.
Plaster  

When you have it as a stone , choose the hardest bits and those
which do not easily crumble away with your nail  , and
clean it well from powder & filth before you pestle it.
Plaster  alone does not withstand fire, but breaks up into pieces.




Reheated plaster se ga  , as is said here, keeps
well one or two months   well pressed in a dry
place , if it's not rainy weather  . But when
fresh, it is excellent for exquisite work.



It must withstand the fire & turn red like a lit
charcoal .
 </div> 107r
<div>  

as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste & that it is
not so easy to handle, as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is
cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws big bubbles or
exhalations in the middle & around, as long as a
finger  . Seeing it in this state, remove it from the
fire for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it
would be too much & would not set as well. For, when it becomes red
& overheats, it loses its strength & spoils the sand. Leave it
to cool before mixing it within the other sands. And when it is cold,
mix and mold, for as soon as you will use it after its cooking, the
sooner it will set.
</div><div>Catching lizards  and snakes 
Take a stick  and attach a string  at the end, which
has a knot <add>eyelet</add>  slip
<add>eyelet</add> at the end. And, being two to three, to distract the
lizard  while whistling, approach the eyelet towards his neck,
and when his head is inside, pull. <add>The lizard  is more
tedious to catch by hand   than the snake  &
bites without letting go & grips like pincers .</add>
Snakes  can be caught by hand  , provided
that it is covered by a thick woollen  cloth , for the
teeth of the snake  stay in the cloth , & cannot
pierce like they would with a linen . The dangerous ones are
recognisable by their blue eyes & asses   deep
azur <add>azures </add>. They hardly ever bite in
water , which crayfish  catchers 
experience.
The sand mixture is of two parts  of plaster pulverized
& reheated  as said, & of one part  of tile ,
reddened et p pre  <add>in a good fire</add>, after
the first cooking & then finely pulverized, and of alum de
plume  , half  of brick , namely two full
crucibles   of plaster , one of brick  &
a half of alum de plume  . There can never be too much
alum de plume  ,s   for this is what
gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand
withstand the fire without cracking & bursting. Otherwise, without
it, the sand would not withstand it. This sand, thus composed, is proper
for all metals , but if you want to use it for gold , one
needs more alum de plume  &  than the above
mentioned composition, and mix in some crocum ferri  , and
for it is this one that attracts gold .
It is necessary that all sand with which you want to cast well,
withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands
abon  c   a great firing without
getting spoiled.
Alum de plume   is awkward to pestle, and it does not
pass through the sieve . Thusly one needs to grind it finely on
marble  . And the one, white, que v  
in powder, that apothecaries  sell , is good.<add> It is
grinds better su   in the mortar  by pestling
&dragging the pinon  , thus you will render it very
fine.</add>
Crocum ferri   must be set ablaze in a
glassworker ’s furnace  for four
days  .
</div> 107v
<div> Molds  can only be used once for fine things, like
wormwood  & others, one needs to break them, but before one
needs to dip them well into water  in which the twice reheated
things dissolve easily. Otherwise, you would not be able
f   to release your work without danger of spoiling
it.
Good alum de plume    is white and as lustrous
as white c   silk . It is in pieces long as a
finger  , & is very breakable & wooly as
down . The one made of stone  is harder & not so good.
Il   The best of the above mentioned quality is
brought in France  near Rouan . The alum de
plume   for our sand is pestled in a mortar , and is
ground further on the marble  , especially since one
cannot think of passing it finely through the sieve , for it is
so fat & wooly, that it would not pass through it. It is this, with
its small soft qui   & thin filaments, which gives
binding to the sand, in a much more excellent way than
tondure   in the founder’s earth of the founders
of great works  , because this tondure   &
cloth waste  burns and alum de plume   resists the
fire.
To enclose the molds , when you em   throw
onto the things to mold your liquid sand, make your  a circle
& surround with well beaten fat earth .
Archanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria,<lb/>


videlicet  res exprimenda formis, sive herba  sit sive
animal <lb/>


ut lucerta , in af inting

sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut<lb/>


assolet) . 
When you want to mold hollow, it is necessary that the
noyau  be of the same substance. And if the snake  or
the animal is curved or folded, one ought to make the noyau  of
several pieces.
Try to see  if distilled vinegar   is
appropriate for eating away & dissolving what will be in the animal
molded hollow.

If you know that your plaster  is not strong enough to withstand
the fire without breaking, do not be so scrupulous an observer of the
mixture put here that sometimes you mecties   would
not diminish the quantity of alum de plume  l  <add>d</add> a little bit, for it softens the
molds  with its sweetness. Once reheated do not pulverise it, on
this occasion, as fine as said, but leave it as the
apothecaries  have ground it, for it does not hinder the
neatness of the cast & gives more binding. When the sand 
mold, estant   having set, retains the color
brick , and is reddish, it is firmer.
</div> 108r
<div>To hold the noyaux , some use wire of the same
metal  that they cast , because it reduces with  &
melts with its counterpart, but because when melting or folding, the
noyau  changes, some find it better to r   use
iron wire  , sharpened at the ends, because it holds
firmer & having delicate ends, it appears as no more than a point of
a needle. And one can apply gold  or silver , before using
it for a work. If it makes a hole, one covers it with a small
chisel .
Eau de vye   prevents the sand from becoming porous
& does not make little holes on the edges of the mold  if
the thing to mold is well dampened with it. The holes & blisters
& bubbles are not made on the side of the mold , which is
thick, but at the edges, which are thinner.
One casts with common silver  with which goldsmiths 
commonly work, which forms a mediocre Et que   alloy.
And when one would cast with solder , it would run even
better.
Spalt    is a whitish stone  which can
be found in Germany , & mainly in Augsburg , which
one uses for the most excellent sand that can be found for lead ,
tin , copper , silver  & gold . And the more
it is used, the better it is. It is appropriate for casting flat things
in a chassis . For round things, it is not as fitting nor does
it hold in the fire as well as the above mentioned made with
plaster .
The shreds of cui   thick, greasy leather 
are p  <add>b</add> good to cast in the melted
copper and latten , for it cleans it & removes from it all its
filth . 
</div><div>Spalt 
Spalt  is white like cooked plaster  and can be found in
mounds and stones  formed in long scales & long veins. It is
very soft, such that with a fingernail   one can scrape
it & makes a powder like our chalk from Champagne  .
And because everything which comes from the earth  is mixed
with some other substance, to purify it, one grinds it, coming from the
quarry , quite coarsely, then one mixes it essence of sal
ammoniac . And, by putting in a piece the size of a
walnut   in a large bottle  of water  and
 </div> 108v
<div> thus one mixes it & reducing it into
p  <add>b</add> small stones , purging it of its
impurities. Then one puts it to cook neatly in a
pot   <add>earthen vessel </add> in
the furnace of those who make pots   , and one
leaves it there until the pots  are cooked. Next, one mixes it
again with essence of sal ammoniac  & one grinds it very well,
and one empties the muddy & clean water  in a separate
vessel . Again, one puts the same essence  on top &
one grinds & again one puts the muddy water  with the other.
And one does thusly, until it has passed everything. In this way, one
purges & purifies it, & one renders it very fine &
handleable. Having taken away the water , by tilting it or with a
sponge , one takes the residue and one dries it. Then,
moistening it with the above mentionned water , like one does with
the other eau    sand, one uses it in
chassis  , where, if it retracts, it is a sign that it
has not reheated enough & that one needs to reheat it further. This
one is appropriate for molding all metals , and especially
gold  & silver , and the more it is used the better it
is. One needs to set aside the one in which you cast lead  or
tin , for it would sour the gold  you would cast.
Alum de plume    should be reheated in a
chaulderon   <add>crucible  covered
with a tile  </add> in a strong flamme  <add>charcoal</add> fire, so that the impurities, which could be there,
burns with it which does not burn. This is done either in the
goldsmith ’s forge , surrounded with
bricks  , or in a fourneau à vent   with
foeu de fusion , so that the sable demeure asses
long temps   <add>crucible  remains red for a
quarter hour  </add>. This is done more to purify it
than for anything else. It becomes reddish on the surface & on the
inside it remains white & better dried out # 
#  After your alum de plume   is cooled,
pestle it in a mortar , then grind it on the
marble  , and it will be rendered in very fine wooly
filaments, which gives binding to the sand, without getting burned as
other things do, which is a fine invention. Pestle it in the
mortar , by dragging the pestle , for the flying dust
could enter your throat  or land on your face , which
will give you reason to scratch yourself well . Put a little
every time in the mortar , to avoid the flying dust. It is
better to grind it thusly, in the mortar , dragging the
pestle , than on the marble  ,
car   where c   it spreads & in
the mortar , it collects on all sides. Render it very fine &
soft to the touch .
Clay  ,to make circles around molds , should
be very fat & handleable, and serves only to make the surrounding of
the molds . Thus, one needs only choose it well fat, and beat
very well & moisten it moderately with some water  & keep
it in a pit  or in a terrine   and make numerous
holes with a stick  in it, which fill with water , in
order to keep always fresh & soft, so that it is always ready to use
when needed.
 </div> 109r
<div>Modelling in wax 
When wax  is too hard, one mixes in turpentine  or a
little butter , which sont pl   renders the
wax  more amiable, and more appropriate than the tallow 
that the Italians  put in, because one has to, often, put the
tools  in the mouth , which are better in box
wood   or bone of hart  .
</div><div>Wax  for molding - 
As the wax  is melted, they have sulphur  that is
melted, in a spoon  or crucible , & they pour some
in the melted wax . And the sulphur  going to the bottom or
remaining on top, it leaves & mixes only its substance amongst the
wax , & renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the mold gently, like butter, without leaving
any gently melts in the mold  like butter , without
leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be warned to not give it too
much fire.
If
</div><div>Molding wax 
So that your mold  grips, without repelling in any place, on
a shape or image of wax , one needs to smear it with oil 
and moisten you sand with lukewarm water , for the cold
water  would furthermore repel the oil  & would not make a
good layer on it.


Smear well, very lightly, with oil , so little that it hardly
appears. Then rub with some eau-de-vie . Next, moisten your sand
with lukewarm water  so that it does not repel the
oil .
</div><div>Bellows  of the forge 
It is best that they be fixed in on some piece of
membreure , through the portevent ,
q   for they are more secure, next you can lightly
secure them from above. It is necessary that the tuelle  be 4
fingers   on the sole of the forge .
</div><div>Snakes  for molding
When you take them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove
their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
removed, they get sore gums & mouth, & can no longer eat. You
can keep them in a barrel  full of bran  or even better of
earth , in a cool place , or in a glass 
bottle . And give them some live frog  or other live animal
for they eat nothing dead. Also I have noticed that
 </div> 109v
<div> when they want to bite or eat something, they do not bite with a
direct attack, but with sinuous turns & from the side, as do
Satan  & his disciples . It has a small head, but
a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small & inconsequential,
but the consequences of it are very great. It abstains from eating seven
or eight days  , once it has devoured some
frog . It can swallow three or four of them, one after the
other, and what he devoured is neither corrupted nor consumed in one go
in its stomach, but p   any part little by little,
that is to say bones and everything. And the remains are found as fresh
as when it had devoured them, such that sometimes, when one presses
& torments it, it renders what it has engulfed, parts of which are
found totally consumed & others as fresh as if it were alive. It can
keep for two to three hours   a frog  engulfed
& renders it completely alive.
</div><div>Toad 
If by chance you want to mold this vile animal & if it
pisses  in your hand , it would burn your hand 
& itch, as if you had handled nettles . But the most
powerful remedy  for this is to put your hand into
fresh earth  , & to cover it as if you wanted to bury it.
A frog  is not so beautiful molded because it has lively skin,
& the other has a lumpy one.

You can mold it hollow, and leaving under its belly an open notch, you
will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw . Or else, if
it is a small, put it on a magnet  of its size, cut thinly, then
put it in good vinegar .

When it is big, one needs to mold it hollow, & if you want to make
it have an open mouth, put some cotton  inside, & then on the
cotton  some melted wax .
</div><div>Killing snakes  for molding
Some put a drop  of aqua fortis  in their mouths,
which makes it really drunk, such that the head & the part behind
seem to be dead, but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it
with a needle  to fit it to the mold , it moves &
spoils & undoes everything. Therefore, to kill them entirely, put it
in a bottle  of good vinegar  & some eau de
vye  . And do thusly with lizards  & other similar
beasts.

If you want to keep them, you can put them in a pipe  full of
earth in a garden outdoors . But your pipe 
must be covered with archal wire  , for otherwise it would
climb & go up very high.
</div> 110r
<div>Molding
You could mold things <add>and animals</add> already cast, but it
never comes out as well as the one from nature, with which you can make
four or five molds.
</div><div>Rock  & grotto 
One needs to pestle white & yellow marcasites  &
diverse kinds of mines  , & then wash them well, in
order that the earthy & powdery part is cleaned, & there remains
only the lustrous grain of the mine  , with which you will
sprinkle your rock  previously covered with colle
forte  , if your grasse  grotto  is
r   not for a fountain & for touching
water , and you will have a nice work.
</div><div>Snakes 
When they feel taken, they hardly bite, & do not have the power
to harm, unless they are really big snakes . The main thing is
to keep from being bitten before catching them, and having put your
foot   on top of it, as close to the neck as one can,
one needs to grab it closest to the head, for it cannot bite if it does
not have the means to stretch its neck & make a sinuous &
oblique turn, & it cannot s   harm with a direct
attack, since he cannot move forward in a direct line, but writhes in
the shape of an S. I saw that the one who taught me to mold
them  did not take this into account, & assured me that there
was no trick to it, other than, when taking it, he would pull it, a
little pressed & held tightly by the neck, & passing it under a
shoe, he would flatten it in such a way that it would render
soubs   from its bottom, which is five to six
fingers   from the end of its tail, all nasty and
venomous things that it had in its stomach, and that after this, it does
not have the strength to bite, and if by chance it should bite or expel
through its bottom some filth, he would only dig the
earth   with a knife , & bury his
hand  in fresh & damp earth  , which, when
applied fresh en   on the infected part ,
pulls out all the venom, and nothing else. It is the same with
toad ’s venom, that I have seen experimented. 

In three, it is almost as thin that it will be after it does not eat.
Molding it as soon as it is caught is best, before it becomes thin. One
ought to kill it only a quarter hour   before you want
to mold.
 </div> 110v
<div> When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it will render it.
And if, after having eaten something, it is thusly pressed
underfoot  , this pains it a lot & hurts it. If it
is wounded, it will not eat willingly.
</div><div>Molds 
There is nothing better for opening them up than to smear them with
olive  oil , & nothing else. And afterwards, when you
want to unjoin them, soak them in cold water , which is the
secret. L  <add>E</add> And you will see that the
oil  although it seems to be imbued, will detach itself, like
grease. Molds  become stronger in cold water . And hot
water  would dissolve them awkwardly, although once reheated, they
are more handleable & easier to dissolve in the
water .
</div><div>Wheat  oil 
Is made on a blade of iron  reddened in the fire . And
the oil  drips off, which is appropriate for smearing the hair of
a butterfly  or similar thing, for this oil  is instantly
dry & makes the remainder dry out. It is necessary that the hair or
down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, for it were upright it
would elevate the sand & become porous.
#  If you want to mold
something delicate, like a pansy , some, to give it a little
thickness, more than what is natural, rub it with butter . But it
is best to smear it with wheat  oil  for it has no body
& does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the
flower firm.
</div><div>Cast of lead  and tin 
Because tin  wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal,
plant or other thing for molding is espe   thin &
fine, do it so that there is more tin , much more than
lead , namely less than the fourth part lead  for three
parts tin  . And still, one puts lead  only to form an
alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong &
thick, put a lot more lead  in than tin . And in one &
the other you can put a little looking-glass tin , but only a
little, with a little resin , when you want to cast. <add>Since
then, when molding with fine and new lead , I put into one
lb  two ounces  of fine tin . And when molding
with fine tin , I put in two ounces  of fine lead 
for one pound . I made plants & snakes  just like
nature.</add>
S   


I cast tin  almost red, and lead  the same, which however
had not remained in the fire for too long, for it becomes brittle and
calcines.
</div> 111r
<div>Reheating molds 
The frames  readily dry out & do not reheat. For
reheating is actually for the second time  to redden &
inflame the molds  in the fire, and drying out is to let the
molds  dry themselves, or to make their dampness evaporate by
placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one.
Noyau  molds  readily reheat & frame molds 
dry out.
</div><div>Latten  smoke 


It is good to reheat in it the molds for casting latten  ,
for this g  <add>c</add>yellow filth , which
appears nevertheless to refill the molds , casts very neatly,
being of the same nature.
</div><div>For red copper 
When it is melted, it is good to throw in a little fine tin ,
for this makes it run.
</div><div>Clay earth 
This one, moistened & well beaten & kneaded as you know, is
necessary for you to make the contour for containing your
molds . But take heed that it not be too soft, but rather as if
half dry, that i  <add>e</add>l<add>le</add> it does
not attach to your hands   , because otherwise
it would attach to your work. Always keep it in a damp place ,
and make holes in it, and fill them with water , to keep it
fresh.

The gray one is best, which does not crack at all.

It is more appropriate than a blade of lead  .
 
</div><div>Iron wire 
You need to have enough provisions of different thicknesses,
according to the molds  that you want to make, some large
like cord, some    & some thin p  ,
like the large cords of a spinet , for small works . You
make, once de   reheated, clamps from it to close the
molds  & the points, like needles of different lengths,
according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded & keep it
subjected. Needles  would not be good for this because it is
necessary that their points be empty & of the same thickness
throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as
you have need of. Iron wire is firmer  than that of
latten .
</div> 111v
<div>Water of sal ammoniac 
The size of two chestnuts    of pulverized
sal ammoniac  suffices in a pot   of water ,
and to the tongue   you find the water 
moderately salty  , for too much is not good.
</div><div>Sanguine 
To clean the various colors of lead  & tin , one
pulverizes sanguine  & with some cloths , one rubs the
e   molded <add>work</add>.
</div><div>Crab  and crayfish 


These are the hardest to mold & whoever molds them well will mold
many other very delicate things.
</div><div>Lizards 
When one takes them with two fingers   from the
sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their
g   mouth, then one takes the a  
end of its lower mandible, <add>with the end of the
fingernail  </add>, & after with the one from above
it bites the nail  , but it cannot pass through, but it
bites very well. And if it were to bite living flesh  it would
au   not let go, & there would be no better remedy
than to promptly cut off his head. In the spring , as they
have changed skin, they are more beautiful.


The small lizards  that one takes in the summer , the
size of small female lizards , grey on the back & green on
the belly, are very appropriate to cast in silver , &
gold , or other metal , because their have rougher scales
than the of female lizards  & show better.

</div><div>Composition of sand
Everything once reheated as it said here above, take four 4 full

& one of alum de plume  . Do not pass through the
sieve  to mix, may   because the
alum   would not pass. Mix with your
hands  , until neither one nor the other, neither white
nor red, is recognised among the other. If your plaster  was not
strong, do not mix at all so much alum de plume  , because
it softens the molds . Take head also that your sand is not hot
(since it has immediately been reheated) C   when you
will want to mix it with water , for this les  
makes molds  too soft & breakable.




You may sometimes diminish the quantity of plaster  if you do not
find it strong enough to withstands fire & if it cracks

the alum de plume  , which you can also increase so that
it creates a better bond.

Already mentioned.
</div><div>Molding en noyau . Mixture of sand
Having reheated your sand, namely the plaster , the
alum de plume   & the brick , & having
passed them finely <add>through the sieve # </add>, mix them this way, take four parts  of
plaster , two of brick , & one of alum de
plume  . Mix them all together with your hands  ,

the other. With your sand ready, you need to kill the animal that you
want to mold de   in this way.
#  except for the alum de plume   which
should be ground in a mortar .
</div><div>Killing the animal for molding
It is necessary that you be scrupulous to not wound it at all in
taking it. And having put it in a glass  bottle d   with some bran , or in a barrel full  half full of fresh & damp earth , if you want
to stock them or keep them a long time , give them live
frogs  & not dead ones to eat, for if you keep them without
feeding them, they wither & grow thin, & have long wrinkled
skins. Thus the best would be to mold it as soon as
apres   possible apre   after it has
been taken. But before, kill it in this way. Place it in a clean
bottle or vessel  so that it collects no dust. And put inside a
sufficient quantity of good vinegar  & urine  so that it
can be covered. And shake & torment it inside, until it is dead,
which will be in on or a half hour  . But if you are
in a hurry

To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar  and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
& when piercing it, it would retract & spoil the mold.
Water  snakes  hardly bite.

<div> to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau de
vye   or else mix a bit with the vinegar . And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of eau de vye  , one uses
vinegar  and er  urine . But for small
ones, only eau de vye  , which is done sooner. <lb/>


When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it scrupulously of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice , like
lizards  have, and then apply thusly.


now put enough in a glass , & soak there & keep there
continually the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
big.


Take head, before it dies,to keep the eyes open, es  
by blocking the eyelids with a little of wax  or something
else.
</div><div>Mouler   Making the arrangement and disposition
of the animal
Having made provision of fat earth   called
clay , that should be grey, because that commonly the best, or
another which has good binding & will should well prepared &
beaten, such that it is handleable without attaching to the
hands   nor the work, make a lazagne  or like a
torteau  of this earth  equally flattened with a round
stick, which pastry-makers   use, which should be a little
thicker than a poulce   . And on this
tourtelle , arrange your animal, aya  
imitating in that its nature, & fa   the way in
which it is commonly shaped. And firstly, with a good needle ,
pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, & up to
u     the top bone of the head. Retract the
needle , & in its place & its hole, put the point of
an iron wire  , of such a length that it suffices to hold the
head of the animal as q   high as it must be, & if
the skin gets in to the inside &  when you put in the
point , pull it out with a  point   the edge of your small pincers , &
arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point  in the
tourtelle  of clay . Thus, the head will be held high,
which will have better grace &once fixed, arrange after the gesture
of the body, & the feet, & the entanglement as you think will
look best. And so that it is secure & does not move at all when you
throw in the sand, mects   secure the legs
& le corp   with little points of iron
wire  , having already made the first hole with a very sharp
needle . Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary,
plantant   making sure that the points 
passing through the animal are fixed in the tourtelle  of earth,
and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal
by a


Take a fine needle of steel  , & which is the sharpest
possible, so that with it, making the first hole to place the points
of iron  , it passes without forcing anything, & by its
harshness, does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a bigger
point of iron   in thick places, & thin ones in thin
places. But head as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
point  passed through the animal in the slab of earth ,
pour   but having planted it, take it out of the
earth  & not out of the animal, & fais
ains   next, fix it. This is done because by fixing it the
first time, it pushes in the skin of the snake  and by taking
the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.


When you put the points  again you have already used, clean them
well of rust , so that they do not take away some skin.


The main layout of your arrangement is to di   place
the head raised & looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head
on a solid plank or table &   , making the
point  pass through the bottom of the throat,
s’arrestan   entering into the top of the head

 
 </div> 113r
<div> bit qua   so that t   you can
take it out if you need to. And take heed that it is necessary that
these points  be of the most delicate iron wire  possible
to bear the size of the animals. For, the more delicate it is, the
smaller the hole that it leaves appears. However, one needs some of
different thicknesses, because il  de   the points  which are put in the body
& in thicker places, like under the throat, ought to be longer &
stronger than the ones of the legs & thin parts, where the
needles  ought to be subtle & delicate, almost like the
biggest strings of spinets  . And it is better that they
be of iron wire , which is firmer than the one of latten .
And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg ought to be
joined to the body, do not put the point  there, not to corrupt
it. But place a piece of wax , as big as a grain of
millet   , between the body & ce  qui   the end of the tail, then with a bit of
flattened & hot iron wire , touch this wax  & join
by lightly pressing. Thus having placed your animal on the
tourtelle  shaped like a mandore , place all around a
circle of the same

 earth , in this way

  & join everything well together in a circle, then, with a
big knife , with which you have cut your tourtelle  to
the right size, pare the outside which exceeds it, & place there a
piece to close it as you see in b. Then, with a small curved
instrument , mark on the inside of the circle the thickness you want
to give to the mold , which will be for a common snake 
as thick as two poulces   , so that when you
throw in your wet sand, you will see when it is thick enough. All of
this scrupulously arranged, moisten well everywhere with good eau
de vye   with a pinceau   the body of the animal
which is uncovered. For this the secret de la plus  
kept well hidden, because everything that is v  
touched by eau de vye   will undoubtedly come out very
neatly & without bubbles  any small eyes or holes 
that we call bubbles, which usually come not at the back & in the
thick sides of the mold , but on the edges. And as soon as you
have thusly moistened everything with eau de vye  , throw
in your wet sand without letting the eau de vye   dry,
which evaporates promptly. And wet it thusly.
 

and make sure that the point  is long according to the height
you want the head, and that it be pointed on both ends. Once placed
thusly, plant your snake  on the slab of earth , &
arrange the head first and then the rest.


Eau de vye   in three goes.




If after you have placed you animal on your clay tourtelle , you are distracted with other occupations, rub your
animal with eau de vye   & under the belly so that it
does not dry & attach itself to the earth  


If, when you pierce your animal, it renders water  from the bottom
of the side of the belly, on the slab of earth , clean it well
with cotton  for the sand that would touch it would be lumpy. If
it is on top of the animal, clean it very scrupulously and touch it
&moisten well with eau de vye  .


</div><div>Wetting sand and molding the first cast
Take a bowl of leaded earth   of such size that
it can hold the wet sand, which will be needed de   to
fill your mold  in one go, which is mei  
better than in two gos, because if you do not throw the second wet batch
very promptly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the
first one will set & become solid,
 </div> 113v
<div> such that while reheating the two casts will unjoin. Et
pour pl   Therefore, for this effect, take several bowls of
different size, which have a lip , to cast better. In these pour
some common fountain  water , & mix into it as
much essence of sal ammoniac  as can be held in an
egg  , <add># </add> composed as mentionned.
If you want to cast in lead  or tin  - because one would
need more for casting gold  & silver  - the
essence  once in your bowl , mesles  
put y   your sand in it & not the essence 
in the sand & add it a dista dista  with such
discretion that il  , while stirring & mixing it
promptly with a wooden  spoon , it does not become thicker
than clear  mustard . And thus throw
le   first the non-thick part, qui
es   as is always at the surface, in shakes &
da   at the top of your mold . And doing so,
since your animal is nearly covered, blow strongly everywhere in order
to dissipate the small and big bubbles that the wet sand makes &
continue without delay to put all the rest which is at the bottom, &
a little thicker than the top, until everything is filled, up to the
mark for thickness that you made.

  And do not forget to shake the mold affin   while throwing, so that the wet sand runs
& enters well everywhere. Also tip your mold  up on the side
of the head, which is higher than the body, and thus your mold 
will have the same thickness, & you will spare sand. All of this
being done scrupulously fai  , let it set, which will
take a quarter of an hour  . Then release the
clay  circle, which can be used another time. And leave it to dry
a little bit, & separate your mold  from the
tourtelle earth , which also de   will
be appropriate for molding right away, and pare the excess with a big
knife , giving to it the long shape of a mandore .
Rasche   Scrape & cut also away the back <add>of
the mold </add>, which is always the weakest, and adapt it
cleanly thusly. And do not forget to make notches around, so that the
second cast fixes & binds better

  without changing.
If you can, fill  your half mold  in one go & with
la pre   one wet batch it is the best.
# or two eggs  , because there is no risk if there is more.
Et l’eau   If you cast in two goes, it is enough
to put essence of sal ammoniac  at the first bowlful. 


Make it clear like a broth of juices , or like starchy
water , that women  use to make their starch . For
there is no risk in it being very clear, because sand always settles in
the bottom & water  separates & remains on top. The same
that one scrapes since it is too weak & soft. And it will not let
itself set quickly, for all things calcined dry out promptly from mixed
water .
 

If you don't fill in one go your mold destrempe   with wet sand, take head to stir your
second cast with the e p   surface of the first,
p   by mixing with the spoon  or a
spatula  with which you wet it.
Essence of sal ammoniac  is not necessary for small
molds , which do not require neither a big nor a long fire to be
reheated, however, when you put some in it will only be better.  
</div><div>Second cast 
</div> 114r
<div>Second Cast
When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is the
back, the backbone, and the entire top part, and the
len   half-mold  where it is enclosed has set
and is hard enough

  uncover the whole bottom part & side of the belly,
#  first with a knife & tant  
at the thickest places, & then with a pen-knife , where the
most delicate parts are enclosed, such as the legs, the tail, &
similar things, and because the head is higher, you will also need to
look for it & uncover deeper, and made a deeper notch there which
ought to release easily. That is to say widening by the outside, so that
the second mold  that you will cast on it can come out well,
which even the animal can help with, which is malleable and obedient,
having naturalness. However ad  , be more scrupulous
when uncovering the throat of the lizard  rather than the
snake , for the lizard  has big jaws & big bones
that are not malleable, and has hollow ears, where the wet sand has
entered, is not aff   easy to release. But you will
avoid all of this, if you uncover half of the head and those things that
you know do not release easily. Once everything is uncovered well, blow
on top & wipe each part, by wiping with little cloths of
swine  fur  , slightly moistened by the end, with a
little saliva , <add>or with clear water , as you dissolve
it</add>, so that your  the uncovered lower part of your
animal will be very neat. <add># </add><add>🝋 </add> With this done, dip le
rev  your mold  your mold, for the length
of a pater noster    in water , not
du  <add>le </add> the uncovered side but
opposite, & the reverse of the uncovered thing. And this is so that,
by sucking the water <add>inside</add>, the oil  with which
you smear after the other side pour eviter  , is not
imbibed at all, but remains on the surface & prevents the second
cast that you will cast on it from attaching to it. Having therefore
thusly dipped <add>the reverse of</add> your mold  in the
water , take a pinceau   especially dedicated to
this, & en oings   with it smear some oil 
the whole surface of the mold , except the animal, which must in
no way touch the oil , & take head to retrace & smear well
with the point of a pinceau   between the parts &
through all the delicate parts. And if by chance the oil  is
imbibed, dip the mo   reverse of the mold  as
mentioned in water , & you will see the oil  return to
the surface in little drops.


Mold small animals like big ones, except that you need to make
delicates points of fil  cist  cittern  strings  , both long & short.
 

Remove with your small flat pincers , all the
points .
# 

and then

+ tantost avecq  
# 

However, leave the point  of the throat, so that it serves as a
clue to find the head, which is deeper down than any other part, because
when making the arrangement you arranged it higher. It is also at the
level of the head that you should make the biggest notch & start
with this one to uncover, and follow the rest through the trace of the
points .
# 

And if some bit of nail from a leg, or from a tail, or from another
should separate from the mold , put y  
between but a small grain of wax , & with the point of a
hot iron wire  , join it then adapt your mold  with a
knife , & make there notches at the sides, so that the other
half binds to it.🝋  
 </div> 114v
<div>  This thus prepared, place your de   first
half-mold  on the tourtelle  of earth  clay , & put the circle also around, & make the mark for
the thickness similar to the first. Then, with another rather thick
pinceau  , moisten well everywhere the uncovered half
& le ventre   of your animal
Et  <add>with eau de vye  </add>,
without leaving anything, if it is possible, which is not moistened, for
this is the secret, which makes it come out neat. And next, as promptly
as possible, before the eau de vye  ne   evaporates, wet your sand, and throw it, in
shakes, and while blowing, & moving the mold , as you did
for the first one, making sure that the premier q  
first thing you pour on the animal should be a little clearer than the
next one, so that it moistens everywhere &retrace the more delicate
parts. So, leave it for a quarter hour   to set, then
remove the circle & the clay tourtelle . And, with a
knife , arrange your two molds  uniformly together in a
long shape of a mandore , as mentioned, because of the cast.
Then dip a little the whole mold  evenly, at the level of the
joints, in water , for this is another secret to unjoin them,
otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore by
this mean, and next, extract gently & with patience and immediacy
the half of the animal remaining in one of the molds ,
for  pulling it sometimes from one side & sometimes from
the other, to avoid breaking any of it, or also spoiling something from
your mold . Et   The latter being empty,
retire   rejoints the two halves so that no dust
enters it, & put them aside until you want to reheat them, make a
cast & vents, & place clamps . As for the animal, so
that it does not dry & that you might be able to mold it four of
five times, put in in water . And I think that it would keep even
better in eau de vye  . However, the best would be to mold
in the same day  the 4 or 5 molds  that you can do,
because these infected animals themselves are stinky  in one
day  . Having left your molds  one or two
es  days   to dry, for they stay
damp for a good month  , make the vents on one
half. 
+  Note that when you have made your second
<add>cast</add>, if you leave your mold , for one
day   or a night  , without opening
it, you would need to then dip it in hot water , or else reheat it
before opening it, as for crabs .


If after both halves of the noyau have made a strong & hard set, you
would not dip your mold  in water , it would not unjoin at
all. But as you dip the reverse of the mold  in water ,
the imbibed oil  collects at the top & at the level of the
joints & and makes it separate.


However, take heed your second mold  be of good thickness &
that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having
dipped it in water , & you want to open it, there is a risk
that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open
it, dip all of it in water , <add>and rub it everywhere</add>,
where it will harden if it has set well.Then, take your two
molds , joined with a rough linen  cloth , in in
order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you
wanted to quarter a loaf of bread . But if happens to break, join
it & on the reverse, strenghten the joints with clamps .

 


Next, you can repair the faults with small chisels .

 
</div> 115r
<div>  if you want, which will be enough, or else on the two halves.
But because one needs to cast by the tail or from the back of the
animal, make it so that the vents come from the head & the middle of
the body to respond to the tail, where the cast is done, which is the
end of the mandore. And having done your cast, do not forget to make in
it some holes and notches because the metal will run more neatly, as if
the cast was even, for it gets corrupted in its notches & holes,
&does not go so much at once, & does not become as porous. This
done, join the two halves of your mold & strengthen the joints,
putting around these some small clamps of iron wire of this shape. They
prevent the molds from deforming & corrupting while reheating.
</div><div>Make the cast, reheat the molds , &c Note
about everything above|-| 
If your snake  has been without eating for a long time, it
happens that, when you want to kill it in urine  &
vinegar , it fills with a lot of water  & swells, and
next it dries out as you fix & arrange it on the clay tourtelle , and next it happens that when you have cast your
moule    wet sand on it, & it has set, it
ends up coming out such that between the snake  and animal there
is a line  of distance D  , in which enters
the second batch of cast wet sand M  . Avoid this
therefore if you can. But if this cannot be, do not let this prevent
your second cast, for the sand which will enter in this void, will be so
weak that it will easily be removed with a small point , &
will not have set with the first hardened one.
Note that one needs more alum de plume   for
molds  which should be reheated, like those for gold 
& silver , & things that one needs to burn inside, than
those which release well, & and that are only for casting
lead  & tin . However do not put too much in one or the
other. 
</div><div>Animal after release
If, by chance, you gave your snake  such a writhing shape,
such that the place of the stomach cannot easily come out, especially
since the head & the tail, which are the two ends, are
<corr>thinner</corr>, cut everything which is outside, & reheat the
mold  so well that what remained inside burns, then pass some
quicksilver  inside & attracting ce qui  
the ashes  & the burnt bones  from the inside, it will
also come out, because the conduit is big, & thus will not sour at
all your substance. You can pull really strongly the molded
snake , because it is soft & malleable & obedient &
the mold , having set, is so firm that because of this the
imprint will not be spoiled at all. 
 </div><div>Reheating molds 
After your molds  have been reheated le  
& cleaned, the sooner casted is best, because if you keep them, they
get corrupted and dampened. Reheat the thickest, where the body of the
animal is, cast as soon as possible, because if you keep your
molds  it will corrode and become damp. Reheat the thickest
part, where the body of the animal is, at the top, so that, if there is
something inside to burn, it falls to the bottom.
Mark the part on top to recognize it
It is only a good thing to leave the mold  die down a little
outside pource  , once well reheated, because it
remains red on the inside when you will cast.
It is the shape of the clamps   </div> 115v
<div>Cast of tin 
If the plant or flower that you want to cast in tin  is
delicate & fine, it is necessary that the tin  exceeds
lead  in the mixture & on the contrary, if it is thick, it is
necessary that lead  exceed. Therefore for the mixture 
fine thing, put in some fine tin , not all the quarter
part  of lead . And make sure that your mold  is
hottish, such that you can hold it in your
hand   , when you want to cast. As for the
alloyed tin , the same as mentioned, it is necessary that it is
very hot & almost red for casting, so that it penetrates. Otherwise,
having <add>a </add> to run the length of the fine branches of
the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And do not forget to
mix in it a little looking-glass tin , which makes it run better
& firms it up.

In the lead alloyed with tin , or tin alloyed with lead ,
you can put a little bit of metalline   & it will seem
silver . But do not put too much, for this hardens the substance
& sours it also, so that for a delicate thing like legs &
similar things, it would not be appropriate.
</div><div>For giving vent to the mold 
In addition to your vents, if your es   plant is
very fine, you can pass a thread  through the
<add>clay </add> circle, rather than casting with a
needle , & make sure it passes through the plant. And with
thread , burning like the plant, a hole will remain, which will
give air & venting, to help clean.
</div><div>Reheating the noyau  molds 
After your molds  have their gate, vents &
clamps , as mentioned, make at the end of the forge en  , or in some clean place, a surrounding of
bricks , and fill it with large half lit charcoal. And place your
molds  on top, and leave the charcoals thusly to light by
themselves for a half hour  , so that they heat little
by little and not all at once. Finally as they begin to become white,
beat peu a peu   the thusly half-lit large charcoals
on top & blow with your little bellows , until they are
warmed. And thusly, little <add>by little</add>, invigorate the fire,
without haste, until you mold s are well red on the outside
& the inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which
does not release well & in this case, one needs to burn
<add>it</add> in the mold  & when you look through the gate
& through it you see the molds  are very red & inflamed
inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if
you do not see this signal, increase &continue the fire until it is
the case. If there is nothing in the mold  that needs burning,
it will be enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is
for casting tin , they reheat better in a reverberatory
furnace .
figure/>
Do not pull out your reheated molds  from the fire, before they
have cooled themselves & take care that neither the wind or the
cold  hits them while very hot, for this would make them burst. One
must not reheat them before they are dry and firmed up for they would
cast in a different way, and it is necessary beforehand to make gates
& vents & place clamps .
 
Take care not to heat the fire in one go, for fear f  
that your molds  crack inside.

They are reheated enough when the entire hole of the gate is red. When
it is black, it is not enough.

For casting in silver , one must not reheat two times
& , if there is nothing in the mold  that needs
despouiller   burning, simply because it does not
release well. All the molds of farriers   are reheated
two times, first for  
 </div> 116r
<div>  

burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts remain inside. Next one
needs to clean them & remove the ashes . Secondly, reheat them
& render them red for casting. At the beginning, reheat with some
charcoals, gently lit, and put your noyau  molds  flat
on the charcoals surrounded by bricks . Frame molds  are
reheated on a grill .


</div><div>Molding bouquets, plants and flowers
 One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they
    wilt & dry out. Dip them, therefore,
immediately in good eau-de-vie  & then put them in your
wet sand mold , like snakes . For which one needs no
release, for while the molds  being s  <add>reheated</add>, the plant burns, which does not happen with
animals, which have bones & q  . It is necessary
that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes 
because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.


</div><div>Molding de  en noyau  with the same
sand, wax  images or lead  medals and suchlike
Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with wax 
what does not, and then smear your images of wax  or of
lead  with olive  oil , very thinly & very
lightly, such that the oil  makes no thickness nor body on the
medal. Then, heat a little <corr>eau-de-vie </corr>until  & when it is lukewarm, moisten the oiled 
medal with it, for if it is  the water  were cold, it
would reject the oil , it would not set well. Next, cast your sand
of plaster , bri  matton  , &
wet alum  on top. Having arranged your image on the clay mandore  & having made a circle around it
de   to give it the necessary thickness. These medals
are oiled  and rubbed thusly with <add>eau-de-vie </add>
because they are firm & hard & would not be malleable for taking
out of the la  mold , which is
tenacious, as are the animals from nature, which are soft &
flexible.


When you have wet your sand, do not throw it in the middle of the
mold , but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently, and
that the beginning is not thick & afterwards thick. If your wet sand
sounds like water  falling in the mold , it is a sign that
is not thick enough. Make it therefore of average thickness.


</div><div>Casting for gold  and silver 


It is necessary that the molds  be fiery red & ablaze when
you cast in gold  & silver , or you burn flowers and
bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the

</div><div>A way to unmold enamel gold  
very delicate gold rose  leaves and others


After you have cast or beaten in gold  the thin leaves of a
rose  or other things, if you want to enamel  them, you
need to solder  or braze your delicate gold  leaves onto
silver strips , which uy   will strengthen them
to support the enamel . Next, once the thing has been
enameled , put the work in aqua
d  fortis  , which will eat away the
silver  & leave all the gold  with its enamel .
For this, the gold  needs to be passed

<div>Molding snakes in all weathers 
aulcu   Because in the winter  they hide
within the earth, some feed them des   a lot in
barrels filled with earth  & covered with
manure  . Others make several molds in
summer , because with one snake , you can make four or
five. And others mold, lengthwise, a snake , naturally without
it writhing, with common plaster , <add>reheated as said</add>pu  , en noyau  & in two half
molds , as said, then they cast it in wax . In that way
they have snakes  that they can twist as they like, and then
they cast them in metal , as is said.

If, in twisting the snake  from wax , some parts become
undone, you can repair it by removing the flaws from the molded
wax .
</div><div>Mixture of tin  and lead 
For delicate plants & other flowers or thin foliage, the fine
tin  ought to exceed the lead  more than three parts .
And if it is a thick & coarse material, the lead  ought to
exceed by more than three parts . Heat the mostly tin 
mixture, until it is almost red & very hot. And when you want to
cast, in removing your crucible  from the fire, throw in two or
three grains  of resin , & for one lb & a half
or two  of lead  or tin , put with the resin  as
much looking-glass tin as the size of a hazelnut 
with its shell , & mix & cast. And make sure that there is
more of the metal  than is needed, in order that some is left.
However, if there is not enough, finish casting, &it will take. But
it will not be so neat. After, dip your mold  into water ,
& with a point  release it carefully, so that nothing is
spoiled. Make your cast  elongated. If the material is very
thin, one needs for it to be almost all tin .



If you mold more  want to cast in lead  or
tin en noyau  in the aforementioned sand, reheat your
mold  once, only if there is nothing to burn within. But if it
is for plants, flowers & animals to be burnt, one needs to reheat it
two times, however not as much the second time for lead  &
tin  as for silver  & gold . For for these, they
ought to be red when you cast, but for lead  and tin , let
it cool until you can you can hold the tip of your
finger   in the cast without burning yourself  ,
in such a way you find a lukewarm heat. 
</div><div>Cast for copper  and latten 
For red copper  one needs to put sal ammoniac , which
cleans & cleanses it of all its crust when it is well melted. There
are some who put in large pieces of old leather  new
leather . Others parings of the feet of field mice  .
Others melted common salt  alone, or melted with saltpeter .
The principal is sal ammoniac  & a little fine tin , as
to what you want to cast. Red copper  is more troublesome to melt
M  than latten . But when it is well melted it runs
better, especially if it is alloyed d’un  with latten .
Latten  alloys itself with a quarter  of copper ,and
one puts it in like in copper . But particularly, a little
calamine  makes it run well.

<div>A means of molding flowers and plants
One needs to choose them in their full verdure & vivacity, &
les mou   not pick them, if possible, until the time
one will want to mold them, so that they do not wilt. Or if you need to
carry them from afar, soak their stems in a bottle of
water  , or better still wine . Make, firstly, a
wax  stick pointed like a big peg, of a size appropriate to what
you want to cast, as you see in the margin, marked A. Put & prick at
the foot of this small peg a bit of iron wire , rather thick &
strong. And at the point of this, you will fit your flower stem or your
plant. This done, set it aside neatly. And arrange your
mold  of t  circle & shape of clay  as you
have done for the snakes , in the form of a mandore in such a way that  according to the size of your plant. Then
take the one that you have prepared to be cast, as we have taught you,
& wet & moisten it very carefully with good
<add>eau-de-vie</add>  with a pinceau . Then pass the
wire stem  through the end of the earthen mandore , in order that the wax q  
peg, where the plant is fastened, joins to the end of the earthen mandore . And arrange thusly your plant in such a way lying down
that it remains in the middle of aforesaid mandore , without
touching on either side, so that a  the sand that you will
pour in it will be of equal thickness as  everywhere, &
<corr>is </corr> exceeds everywhere by the height of two good
fingers   the top of the such  plant. And
having secured the wire stem  well, pour quickly wet 
your wet sand, much clearer than the one for snakes , in the
mandore . And the sooner the better, in order that the
eau-de-vie  does not dry. And take heed to put in a little more
water of sal ammoniac among the common  than you would do for the
snakes . And when you will make sand especially for your
bouquets, where you would mix in a little more feather alum , it
will be that much better. Thus your mold  will be in one piece
and it will not be necessary to unjoin it, but rather leave 
separate it from the clay  once it will have set, let it dry, and
then reheat it again until the plants are burnt.
peys   And note that if the plant you want to cast has
a strong stalk & stem, you can cast it lying down, as had been said.
But if it is some weak & delicate <add>flower</add>, cast 
plant it upright with the wax  peg  because the sand will
always cast  lift it up, it being very clear. Do not forget to
adapt two vent holes with two small sticks , starting at the
foot of the cast, which is the pointed end of the wax 
peg .

If the plants are so delicate that they rise to the top when you pour
the wet sand, one can stop and contain them with a thread 
passed through the circle of the mold  with a
needle .
  
The more delicate the fllower is, the clearer the sand must be.

<div>To make the ashes  of flowers and plants leave
molds 
Some mix  put quicksilver  inside it. But, if it is
a little work, or fine & delicate foliage, that only has
p  a slender exit, they make two errors: the first, that
quicksilver  by its heaviness can break f  some delicate
feature inside when shaken, the other, that some grains will always
linger inside that will make metals  sour & hinder the
perfection of the cast. It is true that if it is to empty the
mold  of some animal which is large & which has big conduits
& passages by which the quicksilver  can easily exit, like a
bird  or a serpent , one can indeed put in it some
quicksilver pou   to break by shaking the
calcined bones of the animal , because the aforesaid ☿  will
come out & not remain at all.

The asparagus  stalk is so hard that most often it remains as
charcoal . Because of this, dry it out beforehand, or wet it with
oil of sulfur & turpentine , or cast separately the little
branches & solder  them onto a fat stalk drawn through the
wire drawing plate .

If the burnt thing has left some filth  or ash , let it cool
a little, & with an iron wire  wrapped in
cotton   that can bend according to the cavities that you have
to search out, clean & blow out this defect, or with a soft
brush  or a clipped pinceau  .
</div><div>Daisies 
They can be cast well in gold . But if you want to
enamel  them, you have to make them by hand & enamel 
them & then attach them. Otherwise, the leaves would be so pressed
together that the enamel  would muddle together there. 
</div><div>Sand that was used
Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with alum de plume ,
you can use it in the mixture of other things & it can serve in
place of brick .
</div><div>Molding en noyau  figures of wax  or medals of
lead 
Rub them with oil  with a pinceau  , but let
it be so lightly that your medal is almost rubbed dry & that it
hardly appears to have been smeared. After destr   rub
it with eau-de-vie  and heat the water  with which you will
wet your aforementioned sand, with plaster , brick  &
alum , in order that being chau   like lukewarm
when you cast it, the oil  will not refuse it, as it does with
cold water , & <add>do not forget when moistening your sand to
always mix in it a little sal ammoniac </add>.

</div><div>Blood of snakes  
If you need to cut some snake  inside the mold  to
burn <corr>it</corr>, cut <corr>it</corr> far from the entrance of the
mold  in order that no blood  at all remains, for it would
make a crust that afterwards would not be taken away by the same
quicksilver  & would remove the imprints from your
mold .
</div> 118r
<div>Snails 
Those which are found in the sea  & similarly those in
which certain small crabs  dwell are very beautiful for

If your molds  are of good plaster  which withstands

if, with presses , they are well squeezed well between two

sand , & in this way they will make any flaws. But if they do
make some, you can remove them with a burin  that one calls
chaple   , which has a tip like a small
chisel .
</div><div>For grottos 

The old vine  stocks 
Stones made from water  called stuf  ;
charcoal ; the compound of tin & fine latten ; paper
pestled  & mixed with pestled glass ; cork ;
heated parchment ; white coral  are appropriate for making
grottos . But fantastical pieces of wood  which are
found in the forests  & mushrooms   and
potirons   of trees , once dry, are better than
any other because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
looking-glass tin  which has a shiny luster. One finely pestles in
a different kind of marcasite  which one washes to cleanse them of
earth , &one sprinkles the work with it, which is very
beautiful. If there is no fountain in the grotto , one
glues  all a l   of this with colle
forte  , which  and it is soon done. <add>Take
specimens of all kinds of mines . The sulfurous marcasites ,
which do not have a grain but are even like looking-glass tin ,
are very beautiful.</add>
Rosette   is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
lumps which are pulverized under the hammer , which are very
beautiful pulverized on grottos .

</div><div>Sal ammoniac 
It Sal ammoniac water  is very natural for casting
in gold  & in silver .
</div> 118v
<div>Casting in frames 
The same sand that was used in the reheated noyaulx ,
composed, as is said, of plaster , brick  & alum
de plume   , is excellent for casting in frames , and I
have experienced it thus: I crushed the pieces which had come out of
molds en noyau   in a mortar , dragging the
pestle , because this sand is very doulx . I did not
pass it through the sieve , because the alum de
plume   mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I
ground finely upon marble   what seemed to me too coarse.
And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with sal ammoniac
water , made of sal ammoniac , as much as the size of two
walnuts  , in a bottle of common water  , the
same size as a bottle in which one boils tisane  , or in a
good pot of water   so that you find d  
the water moderately salty . I mixed throughout water 
of half a glass   of sal ammoniac , two
othe  two au t  silver 
spoonfuls   of eau-de-vie  .
J’a   Having thus moistened the sand in such a way
that it took hold well, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my
medal with pulverized charcoal  with a file , to rid it of
oil , and all other grease , that are necessary to avoid,
for they make  would hinder a good release. I blew on my medal
& molded it, <add>and the female part of the frame  once
filled</add>, I marked & made a line on the reverse of
the  & edge of the medal, & on the nearby sand as well. In
order that the second frame s’em   take the
imprint thereupon to denote the place for making the cast, once
filled the female part of the box mold once filled  I
uncovered the outline of the medal and pounced the whole side with
pulverized charcoal , and then filled the male part with sand.
Once mad  I separated the frame  and did not hit the
corners of the d   medal to make it release, because
that knocks the sand & makes it esp   crumble.
Rather I struck the back of the frame , retaining the obverse of
the medal on the bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not
stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it until the
frames  had been dried out over fire. I lit the  a row
of charcoals between two little trivets of iron   in the
form that you see, and put the back the  & reverse of the
frames  thereupon, & the imprint on top, because in this
way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should crack from
being too moistened, it is on the back,which pr  
takes the harshest fire, & the imprint remains safe &
<corr>whole</corr>.

For the best, one needs to reheat the sand used in the noyau 
before using it in the frames , until it no longer
contracts.
 
 </div><div>Excellent sand
Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, to cover
the medal with.  

For medals & flat things, the true heat of lead  &
tin  is when it is melted gently.

Note that I filled the frame  before pressing it, and did not
hit it at all, but rather pressed it only with the strength of my
hands  , because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure
your frame  that it does not shift at all, & if you put some
moistened sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.

Make the gate so that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the
medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part. Do
not forget the vents.

To dry frames  is to rid them of humidity, so that they no
longer smoke, once nevertheless having been very hot.
Recuire   is to redden the frame, which is done for
gold  and for silver .
</div> 119r
<div>  As I saw that they did not smoke anymore, & that, scratching
the back & the front of the cast & having found that they are
rough & firm & hard on one side and the other, which is a good
sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some fine
tin f  , one lb , & one ounce 
of lead fine & new . I melted it in a crucible  until
it was a little  like a bit red. Being in this way quite hot
I smoked & not p  & being ready to cast & not
before, I smoked with the smoke of a tallow candle   all
sides of my frames  & imprints & cast & everything.
I set my frame , well joined, in the press . I drew my
crucible  from the fire. I left it a bit pass  so that
the redness at the bottom of the crucible  could <add>die
down</add>. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three
grains , like pitch rosin , & when & when the
measure of a bean   of looking-glass tin  & I
mixed, & stirred a little the crucible , and I cast. And the
medal came out as neat as the original. I smoked it with the
candle   & cleaned it with small
brushes .

Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
lower, will come out better, & make the cast longish. And when you
will cast in a large frame  several medals, they will come out
better.
</div><div>Advice about the above
Good tin   is that which is hard as silver 
& soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
tin  & alloyed as is said.
Looking-glass tin  must not be smoked  mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.
 Nor must the forms be smoked until then.
 If the sand shrinks in the frame , this means that it must
be reheated & reddened on the fire.
Good sand when moistened does not stick at all to the
hand   when pressed.
The perfect sand for the frame  is aspalt  
which is found in Germany , which is soft as flour & almo  when wet, and almost all the others are
lumpy.
Nota   that the cast must be thin & hardly thick
in order that it does not overtax the material at all, and must not
exceed the thickness of the width of a grain of
wheat   , likewise for tin , that wants to be cast
very thinly. For lead , a little thicker. There is no need to make
the vents very large & deep either.

For frames , the sand that you use for the noyau  of the
composition aforementioned is excellent. But in washing, crushing &
reheating it several times, it must be corrupted from its nature &
so that it will no longer be fit to grip & for molding en
noyau .
</div> 119v
<div>Fashion of preparing aspalt  <add>spat</add>
It is found in earth in Germany , the color of cooked
plaster , made of long filaments, very soft to handle. And because it
is mixed with earth  and filth , one pestles it roughly
&one makes little balls, having, for this purpose, soaked it in
sal ammoniac water  of such a composition that you were told
above. One places these balls to reheat in the fire of the furnace
of the potters  , then one soaks it again in the same
water . The earth  and <add>the</add> coarseness and
filth  go to the bottom, and the pure aspalt  ,
which is light & soft and handleable as wet flour , adheres
with the water  and goes to the surface, clouding the
water , empty that cloudy part in a separate receptacle .
Having sat, one, one empties the water  by tilting, or by taking
it away with a sponge , and thepure aspalt  
remains at the bottom. Dry it & employ it in frame , having
been moistened with sal ammoniac water . And try it in the
frame , in which it shrinks when reheated or dried, that is to
say that one needs to reheat it again on a good fire and redden it.
Thus, for medals and flat things, you should use this one, because it is
the most perfect of all for gold , silver , copper ,
lead , latten , & tin , for it withstands the fire
& reddens whenever need be, without corrupting. The more it is used,
the b  better it is, & it does not spoil. At the beginning
it is white, & being used it becomes grey. However make sure to put
aside the one that served for casting lead  & tin  &
latten , for gold  would sour in it, & would not come
out of it well. And to do this better, you could put it aside to be used
for each metal . 


See Gesnerus , De lapidibus 


It endures ten or twelve castings without corrupting, it withstands the
fire & reddens, it is suitable for all metals . It is so
tenacious that should the frame  be straked, it holds.




The spat  almost does not set, even though it is reheated & is
a kind of plaster . Raw, it breaks easily with the
fingers  .

</div><div>Sand for casting in gold 
Take common sand  of alum , of plaster  &
brick , according to the composition as said above. Add to it some
more alum de plume . And mix in not the whole of a third
part  of crocum ferri  . However its quantity cannot
be harmful, for it is that which receives the gold , & thanks
to which it comes out very neatly. But it is good that your
crocum   will have been previously in the furnace of
glassmakers  , three or four days  and three days   and three
nights  , in a flat box , where it will be not
very thick, so that it will reheat better.

You could cast well gold  in common sand of
goldsmiths  , should you add some substance that makes it
run. Before the invention of crocum  , one would cast
flowers in silver , but not at all in gold . It has not been
forty years   that one knows this in
Germany .
Sublimate  is commonly employed by goldsmiths  for
gold . Some add sulphur , but they & others are wrong,
for sulphur  sours, even as it heats. And the sublimate  is
agitated, boils and bubbles. It is very good to clean gold 
because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in
smoke. But to warm gold , & conserve its heat, there is only
the color, which is verdet , sal ammoniac ,
saltpeter , & borax . This makes it run & you can
throw in a branch of wormseed  .

best.
River  sand  washed by the current of the

aquosity, it would rot. It also ought not to be too  coarse,
for with its heaviness it would weigh down the flower & make it lose
its form. Having thus chosen it as is needed, take a box , in
which you first make a mound of the said sand, on which you will set the
stalk of your flower so that  laid down so that the flower
touches neither the bottom nor the sides of the box , but
remains in the air. Then weigh down the stalk with more on 
sand in order that it remains firm & fixed. Finally take some of the
same sand & with two fingers   pulverize & cast
it delicately on the flower, e  imitating in this the flow of
an hourglass  . And when the flower is somewhat
half  covered, strike your fist   on the table
where the box  is set in order that the sand drops & enters
everywhere. Finally cover it all over and lay thus there other flowers,
in order, one over the other, as many as your box  can contain.
That being thus arranged, expose it for several
days  to hot sun . And while the flower dries, the
sand, which ever accompanies it & holds it, does not allow that in
contracting, it shrivels & closes in on itself, rather it is
necessary that it dries in the same state as when you put it there. Now

<div>For casting in silver 
You need to arrange your animals as said, and compose the same sand
two parts  of  out of 4 parts  of
plaster , of two parts reheated brick , & one
part alum <add>de plume </add> reheated , and mix
it well. Then, having been prepared thus, and you wishing to mold it,
take the three parts  of an earthenware bowl, from which
the peasants  eat their soup  , of the aforementioned
sand, & add to it pure alum <add>de plume</add> ,
reheated & pulverized  in the mortar , as much as you
can grab with 4 fingers  and the thumb  , or a
small double handful  . Then, mix mix well & wet
with a little sal ammoniac  & the rest of the common
water +  & stir it with your pallet , so
that it all becomes like a thick sauce  or light
mustard  . & having rubbed, with the
pinceau  , the animal with eau-de-vie , cast &
blow, and beat the table  to shake the mold  & do as
with others.

<add>Do not forget to put in it crocum  , for it prevents
the molds  from cracking, & is appropriate for all
metals .</add>
Alloyed silver is better for casting than the fine one , provided
that it is doulx .

One needs for the alum de plume   to be well pulverized
and well mixed.
Sal ammoniac  is a friend of gold  & of
silver .
<add>Which needs to be placed before the sand in the bowl ,
which is put in the water , & not the water  in the
sand</add>
Latten  is the enemy ofgold  & the friend of
silver .
</div><div>Silver  for casting
It is not fine silver but alloyed , & which does not
become perfectly white on the fire, they put it to whiten after the
fusion to also clean it of the solder . or of the  When
you need to attach some leg  animal against another or to
repair, it is commonly teston   silver . And, all
alloyed silver , as long as it is douls , is good.
Before starting to cast <add>in silver </add>, one needs to
have earth of which  which withstands the fire, like
the sandy earth de qu   mixed with cloth
waste which founders  use to cast their canons , or any
good lute  which withstand fire, in order to surround your
molds  & fortify them, for one needs for them to be red. One
needs to also tie them with iron wire  .
That before casting sil  reheating the molds , you
have the mixture one needs to make the silver  run.
If the goldsmiths  knew knew the substance to make
silver  run in their works, they would buy a lot. Some buy it five
sols  for a denier .

I have used silver from the capital  .

Before binding  luting & strengthening your molds 
for gold  & silver  with the said earth , one
needs for the cast to be made & the vents, & the molds 
to have been reheated of  very red, to burn the animals,
flowers and plants that are inside, & to clean them well of the
ashes . Once well clean & prepared, lute them & bind them
with iron wire  , & reheat them again until they will
be well red.
</div> 122r
<div>Arranging various animals
When you discover some lizards , writhing while biting each
other & , which is the most difficult thing to mold,
because of the number of feet & because of the tip of their tails
which are very fine, Il   take heed that should
trou   some part be uncovered, that remains as if
suspended in mid air, to steady it, in order that the second cast, which
you will do on top for the second half, will not vary. And to steady it
over the void, take a little wax , & rub it & lay it on a
table , shaped like a big needle , then cut that which
you will need, & with the tip of a hot iron wire  
join it where it will be necessary. Steady also
frame   on the <add>mold </add> all that will
have detached from it (when you uncover the half of the stomach) with
some wax , taken lightly with the point of a pen-knife ,
& joined & melted with the iron wire  . And when
you will make your cast, one ought only to bring the wax to there &
the edge of the wax  joined to the animal, & which, while
melting, will continue the casting up to the animal, without spoiling
anything, which is a secret.
 One can arrange snakes  bound together in embraces of love,
but that is only when they are small.
</div><div>Flower in the mouth of the snake 
If you want to put in the mouth of the snake  some flower
q   or some branch of a plant which contains the
antidote  against its bite, take a little branch, as best
arranged as you can find, & pose its stem into its mouth. Then put
two little pieces of wax  around the stem of the plant. And with
the end of a iron  wire , that is hot , melt the
wax  a little, & with the other hand  , close
the jaws of the animal. And then you can cut the head to make it burn
with the flower. If the plant s   is strong enough, it
will hold up by itself, and should it be weak like wormwood 
leaf, which droops, the dampness of the sand will lift it up, & make
it swim & hold up without putting anything there, although you could
pass underneath it some thread , going through with a
needle .
     </div> 122v
<div>Cleaning the bowl  and the spoon  with which one
wets the sand
Be careful to clean, as soon as & quickly after you have cast,
your bowl  & your pallet  or spoon  with
which you wet your sand, because ’il   if it dries in
them, it crumbles & falls into the fresh sand & makes a hole or
a fault in the work. When also the mold  is reheated, these
little pieces crust up & flake off & prevent neat
casting.
</div><div>Molding hollow
Wax  on its own cools too quickly & does not run well
everywhere, & tallow  keeps well its heat & runs
everywhere, but on its own it is not good. But when wax  &
tallow  are mixed, the work is only better. Crayfish  &
other small animals can easily be molded hollow for the body, but as for
the legs, it will be troublesome.


The first part of the mold , that is the first cast on the
slab of clay  , cracks more readily in the fire than the
second.
</div><div>Molding medals and flat things
You are not bound to making the gate for legs thus

 

, but rather in this way

 

, which embraces the medal well. For the other way with legs is only
done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, <add>which is
wide and in one piece</add>, works better for flat medals. But take heed
that all gates be very thin close to the medal & almost not as thick
as the medal, if it is not very thin like paper . And then, from
the medal towards the gate, thicken it as it goes, for it comes better
thus. If the gate is thick, at the entry to the medal, the work will
never come out well. Make that, desp   from the middle
of the gate to the top it is moderately thick, & from the same
middle to the bottom very thin. Do not forget to makes grooves at
au hau   the top of the gate to prevent that the
metal  runs furiously.

that the substances can have space of the fourth or fifth part .
Cover the crucible  with a good tile , adapted in a
circle precisely on its opening. And having bound it from top to bottom
and on the sides with iron wire   quite strongly, lute it
with earth mixed with dung or founder’s earth, that artillery
founders  use . And in this, be careful & diligent, & do
not forget to mix in crushed glass  throughout the lute  to
fortify your crucible , in a way that it takes no air, for the
substance would be worth little, because the 4 <add>five</add> last ingredients would be exhaled. 

Note that you need to lute well your crucible , so that the
substances do not take air, for they would be exhaled.


Lute well your crucible , in order that it does not break. For
if it breaks, the substances evaporate & the fumes in it are
dangerous . If within 12 hours   it is not melted
and mixed, it will not be well made. 
Goldsmiths  who know about this substance sell a
denier   of it for 5 sols   to other
goldsmiths , & especially to those who make dishware
in quantity , for at the end of their works, they can solder 
over the first solder  by means of this mixture. In general, all
those who want to mold & cast something delicate. This mixture
should not be divulged, in order that it is not abused.

The grain is like broken steel

<div> Your lute  once dry, put, in the early
morning  , your crucible  in a four à
vent  , & at the beginning, give slow fire, as much for
reheating your crucible  than for gently letting the fury of the
saltpeter  pass. Then, invigorate little by little & with
judgment the fire. And y  leave in the fire’s full vigor, your
substances, for 12 hours  , or a natural
day  . Make each time a good quantity of this substance, to
not repeat it often, because the fumes, which are dangerous, could
hurt you . And before working at it, take in the
morning  good buttered toast , and hold the
said butter , or zedoary  , or gold coins , in
your mouth , and ada   cover your
face  with a cloth  from the eyes  down. From
this mass, the crust will serve you make run <add>to
clear</add>the great works of  the silver <add>from
the metallic  mass</add>like snakes  & similar
things  when it starts to melt. But  And then, the grain
that will be at the bottom of the crucible  should be put aside
for principally delicate flowers and herbs  putting a little
in the melted silver  when you want to cast it, However is it
necessary to always put a little of this grain in the silver  when
you want to cast  it is well melted and when you are ready to
cast . Thusly, do as you make fine tin  on copper ,
& for looking-glass tin  on lead  and on tin .
And, just as looking-glass tin  sours lead  and tin 
too much, if you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain
composed of the above-mentioned substances would sour your silver if
l  you were to put in too much, and obscure it. This
above-mentioned composition will suffice you for a long time, when it
has been for a whole day on a gentle  gentle fire at the
beginning & invigorated degree by degree until the end. Then, having
given it one load of charcoal, let it consume it by itself, & let
your crucible  cool. Next, break it. You will find two hard
slabs & tourtelles  in the crucible . The upper one
is like petrified Once , composed of salts  sublimated
& mixed together. The lower one is metallic, composed of fillings,
aes ustum  & antimony , having the grain very small.
Pulverize the upper tourtelle , made from salts , &
put some to clear & clean the silver , and the metallic grain
can be used to put in the melted metal.
Charcoal  fire

Or, after you have had your drugs  pestled by a peasant. And
having put them in your crucible, & the latter luted & dry as
said & placed into the furnace, have the fire managed by a shop boy,
familiar with charcoal . 

One sells well to silversmiths this metallic mass to soften their
solder, because when melting, latten  exhales. And with a little
of this substance, they solder over the other solder.
</div> 124r
<div>Animals with hair and fragile and very thin flowers
Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hairs raise up
& come out looking mixed up & to  clumped together.
Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative &
that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is wheat
oil , with which you will smear it. Once cast, you will be able to
repair it. The bodies of butterflies  and plants , that have
the stem  & the leaves  that are wooly with some hair,
capricious & downy, need also to be smeared with the same
oil , to keep these hairs laid down; likewise flowers  that
have leaves  very delicate & thin, for dry wheat oil 
makes them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called
dandelion  or a pappus , which comes from the seeds of
burdock  & flies away at the slightest sigh of wind.
</div><div>Noyaulx  for molding hollow
Animals of gold  & silver  can readily be molded
hollow, to avoid weightiness, and costs as well, if they are not very
small. But to make the core & the noyau , one needs the mold
to be freshly molded & not dry.
</div><div>Spider ’s web
It comes undone in water  & thusly, cannot be molded in a
noyau , but one casts the spider  and then one draws the
drawn threads between the grass that they make in the fields on some
carton   with a point. One makes around an edge of
paper , glued to the carton   & one casts with
tin , very little alloyed with lead .
</div><div>Fine gold 
There is a species of gold  which, even though it is very fine
& unalloyed & has been passed through aquafortis  &
antimony , is however so brittle that it hardly withstands the
hammer. And the composition of verdet  described above to make
gold  run, makes it as doux  as lead .
</div> 124v
<div>Rouge clair  @ <add>enamel </add>
Fine gold  is opposed to it, for    on it it
remains yellowish. But alloyed gold  is more appropriate for it,
such as that of escu  & pistolet . If Gold f is not put back on the fire  with its
own pale color renders the enamel  a dead colour.
Ma   And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back
on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the enamels 
beautiful. <add>Otherwise, they are matte.</add>
There is rouge clair  which, once it is used with
arene  , loses its beauty.
Some can be found that have grains of gold  inside, and it is
also the opinion of good goldsmiths  that the good one is made
with gold .
</div><div>Casting with gold 
Molds are reheated better & more surely in a closed fire, such
as pot   in a reverberatory furnace . So that
when goldsmiths want to cast some important piece d’or 
e  that cost a lot to rough out in wax, they put the molds 
in a pot  & cover them, & fill the pot with earth,
sustaining the fire that holds them together & tight. Then, they
reheat the mold , earth  & pot  together, and
when everything is well red, they cast the gold . Fine gold 
does not run well, but alloyed gold does well .
Gold  & silver  do not sour, having been, once
entirely red and hot, dipped in water .
Gold  is a quarter heavier than lead .


When gold  reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
emerald .


Take care that where you want to cast the gold , there has been no
fall of lead , tin , or lime  thereof in the
forge .
</div><div>A means to make the gate for small female lizards 
Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is
so delicate and thin that the casting will find it hard  metal
would run with difficulty, especially when it is curled, roll wax 
in little threads of this size

 

and apply some with the hot iron wire , as said, one at the end of
the tail & the others, that are applied in the same way, from one
edge <add>side</add> of the tail to the other, as you see
depicted. But take heed to make sure, that with the end of the hot
iron wire , the end of the wax barely touches the animal, for the
sand of the second cast will not touch this part. But make sure that the
end of the wax  arranges itself only at the edge of the empty part
of the first mold. Make also conduits of wax  around the legs
&, around the contours of the body, which are a little long &
they will serve as abreuvoirs  for the molded thing. 
<add>Follow here above</add>  


When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate, comes out well,
the rest will also come out well.


The principal thing is that the ears of the snake  come out
well-molded.


Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal & of the
thickness of a knife.
  </div> 125r
<div> & from these conduits & abrevouers , you can also
put there small threads of wax , which are joined to the body, in
order that the metal  goes more easily from one part to another
& runs quickly everywhere. And from these conduits, you lead your
gates & your vents without spoiling anything.
  
From small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of
crusting & removing anything from the mold, because the wax, being
taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make your vents coming from
the head, which is in the bottom, towards the gate. Make also your gate
so that it is too  but little thick, and make within its
course two or three notches, for this breaks up the fury of
themetal  and makes it flow with ease, without bubbling nor making
too much smoke, which hinders its run. You can divide it also in two or
three branches thus

 

when it approaches the molded thing, and always make holes in the
gate.
+ </div><div>Plaster 
When you v  mold something to cast wax  in it, you
mold in plaster alone, reheated after having been pulverized. For, once
reheated in stone , the outside is cooked, and the inside stays
almost raw. Transparent grey plaster  is not strong, but a good
one, is one, that, once wet, is white & sets very quickly. However,
the grey I have found to be quite firm, & hard after having set, but
its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the nature of each. 
If you  You will never mold very neatly if
<corr>ne </corr> you do not wet, very thin & liquid, your
plaster or your sand for noyau . Wet it
mortar   quickly after it has been reheated.

If you mold with plaster crud  alone, reheat it
nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first mold. And when the
second one has set well, and it is ready, soak it for a long time in
water. And if it does not want to release, soak it in hot water ,
for cold water  hardens it, and hot water  softens it
further. Cold water does not penetrate it like it does with mixed
plaster, because it is harder & the mixed one is more spongy. With
this plaster, thus reheated as powder, one can cast medals that do not
fear the rain, especially if they are varnished. One can find these in
Germany, on the houses. But take heed that the water be very hot, &
if it is boiling, there is no danger. All plaster molds, pure or mixed,
release in it. 
To know
</div><div>Scimitars
THe workers  from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to
the Turks, separate, in the mine, iron  from steel . And,
from this first steel, melted when it is first mined, they cast in sand
the sab  blades of the scimitar, that after, cut the other
iron without any difficulty, because any melted iron is harder than
douls  iron beated in pigs & bars. Thus is the steel 
of scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When one takes off the hilt of a
scimitar, one recognizes by the tip that enters the hilt that is cast in
sand .

</div><div>Secret
</div> 125v
<div>Vipers and snakes


I molded a viper, which, for casting, is more appropriate than any other
snake, because it has scales beautiful & very visible on all the
body & principally on the head and under the throat. It has a flat
head, the snout reddish, tending towards carnation, & snubbed like
the horned aspic or like un  the top of a pig's snout, big
jowls, the eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open, where
it has double canine teeth on each side, all coming out of a strip of
flesh that covers and clothed them. It also has, in the throat, a tube
of flesh, made like a dog's penis, from which comes its stinger. Other
snakes have a double row of teeth.


If you want cut the  to mold the snakes their
mouths open, you must cut off the head & leave it inside, for it
will not be released.
</div><div>Molding turtles


It is a particular manner than the casting of snakes & plants and
flowers, because the cavities that are between the two shells require
several pieces. They are molded in plaster to be cast in sugar without
making a gate, as do all other things, that you want.
</div><div>Plaster  for casting in wax 


When you want to cast in wax  in the plaster  mold, you must
know as secret that there is need for your mold to be in hot
water . Never does the animal come out so neatly than in metal,
because the wax sticks. But it is to model an animal as close to the
natural et , to then repair it. One needs to smooth well away
all the scales, when  for wax would enter there, & not
release well. In molding thus the animal, flatten down the scales for
wax, &, on the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they
stand up, for animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not
wait for the wax to cool completely to release it, but do so when it is
still a bit warm. When you have also molded the first cast of the
animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its release, there is
as much of it in one half than in the other. Make also strong wide
gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified when it is
released, & after, you cut that off.
+ Alabaster , commonly called so, is nevertheless
plaster, is very hard, but it shrinks a lot. It is very good to make
medals, but it wants to be very finely sieved.
</div> 126r
<div>Molding fruits and animals in sugar
Sugar  is fatty when runny and brittle & breakable when
dry, and with it, one casts well round things & large muscles, but
awkwardly things fine & delicate. However, try well clarified
sugar . One needs to soak for one night or one day the plaster
mold before casting the sugar, in order that is very full of water &
does not drink the syrup. One needs also for it to be of easy release,
for the sugar is sour & brittle. Finally, do not consider casting
anything in sugar that does not release well and that cannot be neatly
molded in two halves, to open it when you will need to. If you want to
mold a bunch of grapes, one needs to take it, like any other fruit, in
its true vigor, for if it is withered, it will ne  come out
that way. Take heed, therefore, to make your molds in the natural season
of all things. The grapes, that are usually wanted cast in sugar, can be
made artificially or with wax or earth, or even with some grapes
attached with some melted wax on some slab & other full thing, so
that they are very close together and when released & only make up
one half. Or, if you have some of those grapes called chauches or
sauvignons, which have the grapes very close together, encase half of
them sur  in the slab of clay and cast on the other half. And
if some of the grapes are not released, pluck them out. Note that
neither in sugar, nor in metal, can a bunch which has light &
separated grapes be cast properly, because the end of the bunch is so
delicate, especially if you keep the bunch, that it could not withstand
the large grapes. Thusly, you will need to cast hollow, which you could
not do if the bunch does not have close grapes & molds 
without having them scattered & spread apart.
+  To cast pears and apples in sugar , one ought
not make any gates, but rather, fill one half of the mold and then join
the two, and keep turning it until the sugar has set and is cold. One
ought to mix nothing in the mold apart from plaster, reheated as you
know.


One needs for the mold to have soaked one day and one night in cold
water for , and to be humid, when you cast in sugar.


The sign that the syrup  or the sugar  melted in water is
cooked enough to cast fruits, is when it makes threads when shook. And
if it passes that point, it is not good, for it will always be humid. If
the sugar attaches to it, one needs to throw some wheat starch in the
mold, or to rub it with an almond.
</div> 126v
<div>Crocum ferri 
It is best made rather with iron rust  than with
filings . For if the vinegar is good, you will see it boil with
large bubbles as if it  on the rust, as it it were on the
fire, on the fillings, it does not boil unless it is put on the fire or
hot ashes. However, when the fillings are passed through vinegar &
you have made it evaporate & heat up & it is very red, if you do
this again for a second time, the vinegar will have much more strength,
& the crocum will only be finer for it & redder. Those who use
it to cast in gold ven  buy the ounce for forty or
fifty sols.
It does not harden the molds, and, in
scraping, one cannot tell that they are harder from it. But it makes the
mold less dense, and it drinks in and attracts the gold 
better.
</div><div>Plaster 
You can mold with it as large a piece as you please. But if you take
your molds from large works & pieces of wood , it will not
release well, unless you boil  make your wood drink up very
hot wax. For the wood absorbs & drinks & in this way attracts
the plaster. You can assume the same thing for any other large piece of
work. But the cure is to l’ab  soak l’ouvra  with
very hot wax the work on which you want to cast your plaster. For, by
this means, it will not drink it up & will release very neatly.


If the plaster  shrinks, it will always make flaws. Find some hard
ones and it  press your molds well together before
casting.
It is not good when it
shrinks.
</div><div>Plants difficult to burn in the noyau 
Any plant which has a hard stem & like wood  is very
difficult to burn in the noyau , such as asparagus, thyme, &
similar things, because they stay as coal  in the small conduits,
& if they do not reduce well into ashes, it is not possible to empty
them from the mold. Some reheat them, to this effect, two or
d  three times. Others, putting several plants together in the
mold, pass through threads  the plants & the circle of
earth, which is to receive the wet sand,plusi 
This does proceed from plants that have a stem with lines, because
rosemary burns well, but it is in the nature of certain plants.
 </div> 127r
<div> some thread, as much to secure the plants, in order that they do not
rise par  when you throw in your clear sand , as to give
them air when the mold is reheated. For, in doing this, the
mold   thread burns & leaves some empty space
around the plants, which serves as vents, & places for evacuating,
& to give air to the plants so that they burn better. For what makes
them stay as charcoal is that they burn in a closed fire & without
empty space because of their fine sprigs. Try, therefore, to enlarge the
main stem with a little melted wax  & let it cool, then mold
it. And when the wax  melts, it airs it, the principal stem, with
space & as if loose, so that it burns better. Or else, smear them
with oil of petrol  or sulphur , turpentine , oil
of brick , & similar things, or aqua fortis  or
eau-de-vie , or make sands  with crocum , lumps of
iron , emery, & things that withstand several days of great
firing.
Animal bones are not so difficult to burn & reduce to ashes,
because the flesh, once burned, the bones remain loose & the weight
of the quicksilver  makes them break & disintegrate, once
calcined & burnt.

Asparagus always stays as charcoal, like little pins. Try to take it,
and thyme, at the beginning, when they are growing, so that their stem
is still thin.
</div><div>Molds of plaster for wax 
When your mold of plaster is done & dried, take heed that your
mold be of good release, for sometimes it happens that the animal, being
wounded or thin & withered, makes wrinkles, where retire 
there being some scales, that is where the plaster enters. And this not
being of good release, the wax animal attaches itself & breaks &
you would never have it perfect. Take heed also to make your gates for
the wax very wide. Thusly & that the gates are not too thick. They
are made when the animal is   the mold with both sides is made & the animal is outside
of it.
</div> 127v
<div>Founder's earth
It is terre bolbene   mixed with dung or cloth waste,
which withstand fire, which you need to always have provision of, to
lute your molds which must be used to cast silver & that you need to
reheat. Those, where one needs to burn some flower or animal, should not
be luted, until they have been reheated once and they have been cleaned
from bones & ashes remaining inside, and having removed the clamps,
you have opened the two halves to see if they have any cracks. For there
is some plaster that is not so hard in the fire, the one as much as the
other. Moreover, there is some which makes crusty the things which stay
burning inside. And these are imperfections that one needs to avoid,
either by  by bathing well with eau-de-vie the animal before
casting in the wet sand, or mixing in more or less brick, or alum, or
reheating the brick more, or in place of the brick, mixing in crucible
bottoms & similar things which resist well in the fire. Having
therefore reheated your mold to burn it inside, leave to cool well. And
if it is neat & not cracked, reput the clamps & lute with this
above mentioned founder’s earth & sprinkle a little sifted ash &
let dry a little. But keep yourself from luting that they are
not  until the molds are colde. Those for casting silver, where
there is nothing to burn inside, only need, except when the gate &
vents are made, luting & reheating once. Do not lute the end of the
mold where you want to make your gate, rather leave it uncovered &
the exit of the vent as well. 
If the molds that  were do  to crack, it is
make thus  at the first reheating, for at the second, they no
longer crack.
The smallest molds are reheated more quickly. Take the 
therefore the first ones reheated when you cast, for you can put several
of them to reheat. .
Light the charcoals, firstly in the forge, or in some other place
nearby, & having placed your molds on a layer of good embers, not
burning too much, to have a slow fire at the beginning, put there &
adjust a little the half lit charcoals in the forge.

The earth that founders use to braze or solder, which is sandy clay
earth, or else clay mixed with sand, after having dried & sieved
& then composed it, is good for luting your molds, because this
earth melts rather than cracks. And any earth that melts is 
cannot be lacking in this.

Iron wire to give it bond.
 
Lute thickly your molds, & if they are small, you can reheat them
immediately in a good fire, especially those of crocum.

If the earth is good, & l  does not crack while reheating,
& does not separate from the mold, the molds will also not crack
& will not make flaws at the casting. Reheat with slow ease in a
closed fire & do not expose them hot to the air.

Lute rather thickly in two or three layers, especially right in the
joints, in order that the silver does not come out of the mold. 

Reheat in a four de reverberation .

To test if your earth is good, before putting it on your mold, lute at
the place of the wall of the forge which is around the tuelle 
& barrel of the bellow, & light the fire and if it withstands
this without cracking, it will be good.

<div>Casting in silver  and gold 


Wanting to melt, always put for these two metals, a small stone of
pulverized borax at the bottom of the crucible & the gold and silver
on top. This makes it so that if the crucible renders some steam or sour
smoke, it will not impair these two metals. For gold mainly, this is
good.


If you have several molds to cast, do not think of filling them in one
cast, for the metal  would be cold. But having cast while hot
& filling one, remelt & cast in the other. 
When your mold starts to redden on the inside, & that the
cast loses its blackness, then put your  & that looking inside
the cast you you  do not see a single point of blackness,
continue to maintain it in this heat & if needs be, adjust it in
some half lit charcoals with your molletes . However,
com  put in the forge your crucible with a little ground borax
at the bottom, & the silver that you want to cast in your
forge should be on top. Let your crucible reheat between the lit
charcoals jus without blowing  until it is red, for
before, one ought not to blow. And when you do blow, push in a long and
continuous movement the bellows, giving them a little shake when pushing
& another when pulling towards you. In this way, the heat becomes
stronger. Com Ne Take heed to raise sometimes your
crucible with the with hot pincers, because that if
it is placed right in front of the tuelle  & the
bellow  b <add>wind builds the</add> wind
of the bellows hits the crucible, it will cool your silver rather than
heating it. Make sure that the lit charcoals support it from above the
tuelle  & take care that it is at a distance of three good
fingers from the wall of the forge. In this way, it heats better.
Therefore, when your silver starts to melt, if you recognize that it is
brittle, seeing cracked & burst lumps, take the size of a hazelnut
of arsenic & two times as much of raw tartar, coarsely pulverized,
for in this way, they have more ability to heat. And throw it sometimes
in the crucible on the silver, which clarifies it. But if you have some
of that sublimated crust on a metal substance, which looks like
grain  of steel, as previously described, take a little of that,
leaving #  the others & throw it on your melted
silver.


Some let the silver rest a little outside before casting.
Gold  and silver , melted with the above said things,
scarcely become porous .


For gold , one does not need d  as much tin 
crocum as alum de plume  .


Small molds are reheated quickly, but big & small ones should dry
beforehand in the oven, for the humidity of the mold, by e fo 
the heat of the oven, is attracted outside. But the fierce heat of the
charcoals chases it from the exterior through the inside.

You will see that it will torment it & heat it very well and soon
render it very liquid & ready to cast and be clarified, as it should
be. When it is in this state & that it is very white and polished,
shining like quicksilver, prepare yourself to cast. And to this effect,
have some thin delicate sand, in a terrine  or another vessel,
that you would like to help yourself to. Make a pit in your sand, then,
with your pincers, take your well red mold & place it in this pit of
sand. Cover immediately the opening of your mold in order that no ash
& dust enters inside, & then enclose it with sand up to end of
the gate & the vents. This done, uncover your mold & throw on
top of your well melted silver, the size of a pea, or thereabouts, some
of this metallic grain , which will immediately spread through
all your silver  & make it boil & turn. Cast as soon as
you have put in this substance, for it is this that is the secret to
making the silver run, since its crust heats it & clarifies it. You
can cast silver finer than the alloy from the capital and like the
realle, but you must add this grain  in.


With all of this, do not let yourself forget to put, before all things,
a little borax in the melted silver, for even though goldsmiths do not
put any in, however it is good, and I have seen it practised well. Next,
one puts in the crust of the substance at two different times & then
the metallic thing. Then make sure that it be placed at the end of your
forge.


If you want to blow the ash that is around your mold when you hold it
between the pincers, hold it with the opening at the bottom, &
blow.


When silver  is well melted you can uncover it and blow with the
small bellows, not continually like with gold , but only to cast
out the charcoals  in order to put in the substances that make it
run.
</div><div>Whitening of cast silver 


Because one commonly casts in base silver, & especially the Germans,
and that such an alloy readily makes chappe  or crust,
which is opposite to our  some goldsmiths from
France   are usually quick to whiten their works,
especially for big quantities, because they only use common
bullitoyre , which is tartar & common salt, nearly as much
of one as the other. But I have seen an excellent German working thus.
Having, in my presence, cast a little lizard with an alloy of teston, he
made a greyish crust. And to clean it from it, he boiled it in the above
mentioned bullitoyre  of tartar  & pulverized
common salt and  mixed with common water , in the
fire of his forge. Once taken out, he brushed it. And because it was not
as clean of this crust as he fancied, he burned some tartar in some
paper until it was black & no longer smoked. Then, he wet the
aforesaid tartar d  with the bullitoyre  water,
composed of salt & tartar, & covered all his lizard with it.
Then he put it between the live of  charcoals of his forge
& blew a little. When the lizard  was red, he took it out,
let it cool, then reheated it in the bullitoyre , next he
brushed it in clear water. 
+ 

Note that the bullitoyre  for silver  is never good in a
crucible because the water, taking the form of the f  tartar,
evaporates. But the vessel for boiling, being of copper , is
excellent for whitening silver  & for the mixture which colors
gold .


He heeded to not let his tartar water  boil so much that it poured
out on top, because then its strength goes away. Therefore, when this
first fury of boiling comes, remove it from the fire & put it back.
He held as a secret this burned tartar put on top for base silver.

</div><div>Spider molded on a leaf


The very big ones usually have hairy feet, which are difficult to mold
if you do not keep them flat with some , or burn them with a
candle, or stiffen them & lay them flat, smearing  them with
wheat oil . Kill them in vinegar  & urine , like
snakes & , or in eau-de-vie , and then
shape them on a well-made vine leaf, or other thing. Next, you can give
them back their capricious hair with bourr  the sieved fine
hair of cloth waste, by smearing them with dun  fish glue, or
similar things. Their true color is of vinegar  & greenish,
& then fumigate them in various places with sulphur. Having made
your tourt  clay slab, place on it your vine leaf, and the
dead spider in the middle, & pierce with a point of iron or latten
wire the middle of the spider’s body & the leaf together. Next,
place diagonally somal points of latten wire around the vine leaf to
secure it well. Then fix, with a little melted was and the point of a
hot iron wire, the end of the legs, adapting them with the end of small
pincers. Do the same thing with the end of the spider’s small brows.
Return🜊 
 

To make the gate for the spider  on the leaf, and to prevent the
sand from covering the spider from underneath the belly, furnish the end
of the tail & the bottom of the body with a little melted wax, &
applied with the hot iron wire, as you know. In this way, the leaf
burning & the wax having melted, there will remain two little holes
in the meaf which will be the gate of the the spider.
🜊 

The wax once cooled, scrape the excess with the point of a pen-knife, in
order that the end of the legs stay neat. Next, place the circle of
earth around & cast your wet sand, like for other things. In this
way, one will need to burn the vine leaf in the mold, otherwise not. And
to cast more easily, let the animal die fully, in order that, when
struggling in does not mix up its legs. Having made your first cast,
uncover the reverse of the leaf, and make the second cast.

<div>Molding a crab
It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold it well, because one needs
to proceed differently than with other animals, because its shell is
very difficult to mold  burn & in this case, one
le  needs to sometimes reheat the mold three or four times.
And with all of this, it leaves a hard crust, grey like ash. But because
it does not mold in one piece & one cast, like plants, but rather in
two casts like snakes that release well, one removes this crust, not
with quicksilver, which would do nothing, after it is open, with the
very fine point of a pen-knife with dexterity, as with the little crusts
of the second cast, which enter in the nooks that the sand or the molded
animal made. But, la  because it has curved legs, here is the
cunning way & secret for releasing it. Therefore, as you have molded
it on one side, which is on the back, in the same way as others, uncover
its belly, & all its curved legs. Make your second cast in the same
way as others, but, as it will have set, keep from opening the mold
until you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because of its curved
legs, you would break everything. In this lies the dexterity. If you
recognize, after having reheated & opened it, that the crust is not
burned enough, reheat until it does.

this roughed out ci  figure of wax. But if it is composed of
ceruse or similar things, it is necessary that you put your mold in
boiling water.

For figures of flat wax, there is no need for all this, for the wax

</div><div>When the cast of tin  or lead  becomes porous


If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
wax, that you can gilt afterwards with silver or gold. To prevent this,
if you cast thin, the alloy of one ℥ d’est  of lead
for one lb  of tin is good. But if you cast with lead for a
thick thing, one needs for one lb  of the latter, two ℥ 
of tin, for the lead being fat & weighty, carries more. From this
alloy, I cast a large lizard, as if natural. In thick things,
if  which keep their heat a long time, if there is little tin,
it makes it porous. Your mold must not be cold, but of such a heat that
you can handle without harm, or that you can keep your finger in the
cast without burning it. It also necessary that your lead or tin be like
red.Melt firstly the lead, & then the alloy of tin on top. And as
you want to cast, put a piece of resin & then a little looking-glass
tin. @If you put into the tin too much lead, it does not run very thin.
And to know this, if l  the tin shouts loudly, it is a sign
there is not enough lead. If it shouts slowly, that means that is there
is too much. Take heed

You can solder with the l’es  same substance, then repair it
with the burin, file, chaple  & similar things.
Tin  is a metal that penetrates, that becomes porous & burns,
and is fanciful to us, more than gold and silver.
Lead  wants not only to be red, but also lively & runny &
liquid as water, which is a sign of its perfect heat & the mold
ch f  is so hot that you suffer with your finger in
it. Do not open until it is cooled. It is a sign of a good cast, as much
for it as for gold & silver when it exits by the vents.
 </div> 132r

</div><div>Mold made in two casts
It opens once reheated to be cleaned, next, one puts the clamps on
again, one lutes the mold & especially the joints, then one slowly
dries the earth. And then, as it no longer smokes, one leaves the mold
to cool until you hold it without harm. Next, put in the presses or in
the sand in a terrine , & cast in tin. For if you were to
cast in silver or gold, it would be necessary that your mold be reheated
twice & cast, as it would be red.

If your mold f , through the fault of the plaster, retracts in
the fire, one needs to open it, after the first reheating, to tighten it
again & clamp it and lute again and tighten again. 
</div><div>Method for reheating the molds
Light charcoals  in the forge, & then arrange them in rows
in a corner of it, according to the size of your mold, in such a way
that it can be furnished with three or 4 fingers all around, and
especially at the bottom of the mold, which is the thickest, and
which . Your charcoals thus arranged, place your molds on top of
them, & not on a grille , as some do, because they would
take the fire too harshly. And leave for some time thusly, & little
& by little warm your oven, always adding some lit charcoal. And as
long as the mold is damp, the charcoals will be as if died down from
below. But as it dries, they will light themselves. And when it is dry
on one side, turn it to the other. And when it is dry on both, & it
no longer smokes. At that moment, invigorate the fire & cover it
with lit charcoals. And as it begins to redden, do not blow the
charcoals with a little bellows, for this would make it blow 
burst. And similarly, when it is red, keep it well covered with lit
charcoals & do not uncover it, for it would break. Make sure wind
from a window does not beat on it. Let cool

When you want to reheat your molds, &  be they luted or
not, mark the place on the belly to put it under, against the lit
charcoals que  because if the ardor of the fire would make
them crack, it would be better that this be at the belly & from
underneath, than on the back.

@If your mold is small, one ought not to leave it rest  so
much in the fire, for it corrupts and breaks there, for it reheats more
quickly than a big one.

</div><div>Common sand  from the mine 
In a frame, if one casts hot, it becomes porous, therefore one only

</div><div>Crocum ferri 
Having d  passed it through vinegar & reddened it in
the fire, I had it finely ground on the porphyry, until no roughness was
recognisable on the nail. Then, I wet it with very good vinegar, &
la <corr>u</corr>’y  left it two or three days,
stirring it several times each day. Finally I boiled it, & reddened
in  the pot & crocum all together in the four à
vent . It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that can be
pulverized very finely between the fingers. I put some in the sand,
a  half as much as alum de plume. I wet the sand quite thinly
& molded out of it a very small lizard, which molded very neatly
& delicately & very finely. The crocum ferri did not render the
mold harder, but it firmed it. And when your mold is douls 
& fat, when scrapping it with a nail, it is a sign that the crocum
is good, very fine & well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the
mold, because it is a friend to gold. And I believe that silver would
come out well. And that the mold, through this means, does not crack.
Make it from fillings of needles.

One can put some amongst the molds, where you want to cast silver, for
it firms the molds, and you will find it so, by scrapping a little
harder than the other where there is none. It molds very neatly.

This one is appropriate for all molds, & keeps them from breaking
& bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands several
casts. The one of steel fillings & needles is redder &
better.

gate for the aforesaid feet. And should the bottom of these come of in

will come out well.

L With the points, one has previously set the shape,

around the hole some moisture and a little excretion , which hinders the
sand from covering the point & there always remains some little
openingg . But to avoid this, you can plant in the slab a iron
point, arro  cleaned & rounded at the top end & on
this end place there a little hard wax or du  some mastic or
cement, and through the means of this hot iron wire, hold thre the
throat of the animal, which can be removed when you come to uncover the
belly & the throat to make the second cast.
</div><div>Clamps and broken mold
When you have made the first reheating & removed the clamps, and
you have the  opened your mold to clean it by blowing, with
quicksilver, which is used only in enclosed molds, close the mold again
& put the clamps on again, but not in the first place where they
were. Lut again & dry again. But if it is for a cast with silver or
gold, lute with the remainder of the sand that was used, for it is the
safest. If you mold, while reheating, is broken, you can adjust it with
some clamps & lute.

strongly enough when casting on the wet & cast sand in order to
dissipate these small bubbles.


When the sand is cast thickly, it readily becomes porous


</div><div>Thing that does not release


One needs to cut it to make it burn in the mold, but cut it with chisels
in one go, in order that the blood does not fall on the mold & does
not create filth, which, once reheated, is difficult to remove. Next,
put your mold in the oven or similar heat, in order that it quickly
dries & retracts, before making a crust or mold on the mold.

When you mold small lizards , and you want to uncover the first
molded part, begin to uncover the heads & you will recognize its
place by the pin. Do not attempt to uncover the legs until you have
uncovered the rest of the body, in order that the bared body, when
moving, does not remove the legs from their place, where it is difficult
to put them back. When you remove little points which hold the legs, fix
them & press them with something, in order that, when removing the
pin, they are not removed from their place, or, in the end, you can put
them back with some wax.
</div><div>Various animals entwined


You can entwine a snake entwine  with a
lizard , one biting the other, or a snake  that eats a
frog  or a wall lizard s  & similar
things. But because these entwinings can in no way make a good release,
cut what you can & leave the rest to burn. And to keep a wall
lizard, which is small, in the mouth of the snake, which is raised &
needs to be supported in the air, po , because the head of the
snake is placed raised, put underneath the wall lizard se  an
elevation of earth suited to support it. And if you put your mold in the
oven, the animal, drying quickly, retracts & burns better after.
if you see  These entwinings are also made to cover a wound or
fault in the animals, that one usually wounds when one catches them.
Also, do not forget to attach & join, with some wax, finely applied
with hot iron wire, all the parts of the animal which pass one on top of
the other or those that you notice are not well fixed on the slab of
wax  earth, in order that the wet sand does not remove it. And
it is to
 </div> 134r
<div> 

avoid putting points, which should not be put except at the raising of
the head, at the thickest places of the body & the simple &
delicate parts in the middle of the lizard’s feet, the nails of which
you will enter into the slab of clay, in order that they remain secure.
When you have made the first cast & uncovered the belly of the
animal; do not forget to put small thin s  slabs of wax at the
end of the lizard’s legs. But, if it is a small wall lizard, lightly
cover with wax the entire bottom of the foot, and  and
this  the wax, being removed after the second cast, leaves a
cavity which fills these small fingers with metal, & then one
repairs them. Take heed therefore to attach well with wax the parts of
the animal which pass one on top of the other, in order that the wet
sand entering between two does not take it away. And if  For,
if this were to happenmold would corrupt , the shape in
the first place  would spoil  corrupt & your mold
also, because it would not have the thickness that it  you
think & would be pierced & spoiled. And, even though to avoid
this you can make the mold thicker, however, should l  this
mishap happpen, you will be able to repair it in this way.
</div><div>For mending a pierced mold


If the molded animal comes away in some place and deviates from the
shape to not have  that you gave it, because it was not very
dead, or because it was not well attached with the iron points or with
melted wax, and it does not have the thickness that it needs on the
outside, at the middle of the swelling, or is pierced, before removing
the animal from inside, uncover what seems to you the weakest part, or
else the place that is pierced, and make small holes all around
<corr>all around </corr>, then soak the back of the mold. And
cast quickly on top of the same wet sand, which will enter in these
openings & mold & attach to the other. But, one will need to
lute this place well, after. 
</div><div>Sand of crocum 


One can use the mixture of crocum ferri in molds for silver as well as
for gold, for it firms them & keeps them from cracking & making
flaws. And I believe that for flat things it would withstand bien

done.

grind them again with some good strong vinegar until it is fine, like a

have time, or in the fire lent  of the forge, & make sure
it is well dry.

</div><div>Secret for soldering gold  and silver  for small
works


If some piece of small leg does not come out well in gold  or
silver , by fault of not having made, underneath, a gate of wax,
beat some soldering gold very thinly, then cut it in as many small
spangles as you need. Take some of this phlegm or white thick
which saliva  that is found on the teeth, & with
the point of a burin, apply it to the place you want to solder &
place there a little spangle of gold & next, with a little fat
earth, wet with saliva, make a small layer, on the opposite side, to
hold solder better. Next, pulverize on top a little borax & put in
the fire. Boiled quince seed water  & others also.
</div> 135r
<div>Colors for gold  or mixture
Verdigris  & sal ammoniac , as much of one as the other,
& as big as a bean of saltpeter . For if you put a quantity,
it would make it all boil so much that it would boil over. Saltpeter is
only put in to make it boil, in order that one recognizes when the
substance has boiled enough. This color, put on sour melted gold,
renders it doulx  immediately.
Softening gold  </div><div>Gate


It is necessary that it be longish with regard to the thing that you
molded. And for big molds, at the very least, it is necessary that it
have four of five fingers of length. You can make it wide up until the
middle & then divide it in three points in this way. And as much as
the molded thing is small, it is also necessary that your points be
small. And in the middle of the gate & of its points, make there
some openings in order to prevent the fury of the metal & make it
run gently. One also needs to c  conjoin the folded parts of
the animal with little notched lines, a especially the end of
the tail or other delicate part, in order that the metal flows
everywhere & carries itself from e l  one part to the
other.


Do not forget to make a gate of wax for the legs of sand lizards &
delicate things like this.


When you have molded an animal in the first part of the mold, do not let
this part dry before you have taken away the said animal, for the mold,
in drying, contracts and would also make the animal contract. Keep it
therefore in some moist & humid place until you have done it.
 </div><div>Vine leaf  and small frog 


Take vine leaves  to mold, as they are in growth, likewise with
all plants & flowers or a young vine growing again after having been
cut, or when they rebud in autumn, because the new leaves are more lumpy
& have more apparent lineation. On the contrary old leaves are
smooth on the inside & pierced in several places. Therefore place
your leaf bottom down on the clay slab, and secure it with small points,
nevertheless leaving it its natural curve. And make a notch in the clay
to hide the stem at the first gate, which, once made & dry, you will
take away the stem from the leaf & clean with it well with small
bristle brushes & fix it with a small mount of clay. Next, make
several gates around the leaf with wax as you know & gec 
make the gate thin & with several lines & lumpy.


The vine leaf  is painted with green made of stil de grain
yellow  & verd de terre  .


You can cast on the leaf a spider or frog & whatever you like.

<div>Casting in ☼  
Take a crucible with a capacity suitable for what you want to put in
it, crush a little borax coarsely & put it at the bottom, then the
☼   on top. Arrange the crucible on the charcoals
of the forge in such a way that the wind of the bellows blows on it from
underneath and not at the side, for this cools it & does not heat it
enough. Make sure also that it is distanced three fingers from the wall
of the forge, in order that it can be surrounded with charcoal. Let the
said crucible reheat, until it is well red. Then, make your boy blow on
it with long and strong pushes, for in this way it heats well 
better. And nevertheless blow by  when the gold is melted,
blow on top with a little bellows, for the gold will become brittle
& take on a chappe . And as long as it makes a swirling
smoke, as you blow thusly, it means that is not doulx  enough
for the cast. Uncover therefore the crucible & without moving
ch  it from its place and without interrupting the blowing,
make it lean towards you in order to see well inside. Throw in it the
size of a bean of borax & blow inside in jolts with the little
bellows. But if there is charcoal inside, blow a little stronger to make
it go out. And if the gold smokes & swirls, put some more borax in
and note  blow on top, making sure that, if it is still
brittle & not softened enough, it does not cover itself when you
blow, as if it had cooled. But if it does not make this sign, it is
douls  enough. @At that point blow very strongly in order to
heat it well, and as you think it is hot enough, throw in on top, in the
crucible, the color composed, as said beforehand here, of verdet,
saltpeter, sal ammoniac & a little borax. And let rest 
blow always with the small bellows, and the gold will become shiny
like

If you cast in gold  some important piece, lute your mold with the
same sand  where there is  there is some crocum.

If you want to cast some large work in gold, or which is important, make
at the foot of the forge, or at one end of it a four à vent ,
where you can hold your mold in the completely n  red sand.


One can cast two or three lb  of gold .
 </div> 136r
<div> a mirror. And since you want to cast  cast, put again a
little of the color & let rest a little, always blowing with the
small & large bellows. Finally, arrange your very red mold between
the moulet  or in a crucible full of very hot sand & cast.
And when it has set, throw, if you want, in the water. For gold does not
get damaged like tin, which jumps.
To melt gold  in ingots, it is of no importance
togec  blow on top with little bellows.
For large works, the crucible of sand  needs to be put in a
fourneau à vent , to become entirely red at the end of the
fournaise .
The gold  that the wind hits or that one forges, becomes
black. But a little aquafortis uncovers it immediately..
If you have some work of sol  on latten to forge, like one
does small statues, put between the gold & the latten a blade of
lead. And before reheating the gold & reputting it in the fire, soak
in aquafortis & it will be douls .
It is enough that the gate be of the thickness of the medal
  , that is to say from the middle of the gate to the
medal. But if the medal is very thick, one ought not, for this reason,
to thicken the gate, for a very thick gate never comes out well.
Mai  It could well be made wide, to embrace the medal, the
most possible that can be done.
</div><div>D Esm Enamelling thin works
Goldsmiths  scrape gold  leaf with the brim of a
burin  & then they set enamel  down on it.
</div> 136v
<div>For casting with latten 


The latten  from skillets, where one makes the mush for little
children, which is doulx  is appropriate for the cast. Some say
that German tokens are  contains a lot of calamine. However,
as they are thin, the calamine exhales out when melting them, as it does
in all meta  remelted latten, which through melting again
returns red. However, fresh calamine & on its own, put again on
melted latten, makes it run & cast neatly, because the one that is
in the remelted latten is half corrupted in its natural state, &
makes it become porous & blusters because it is disposed to
exhaling. Therefore use calamine alone, on its own, very recent, on the
melted latten. Take heed to cast very hot & that your mold be red
like for gold, silver, copper & metal. If you cast with recent
calamine, keep yourself away from the smoke, for it is pernicious. I
wanted to use German tokens to cast medals & took thirty & xii
nails of rosette , like for chairs, which are of doulx 
latten. This substance, containing a lot of calamine, like all strong
yellow latten, strongly smoked, which is what prevents latten from
running and makes it porous. Make many vents & cast very hot, that
your latten is white like water or melted silver & similar to a very
polished steel mirror. The second fusion comes out better, because there
is exhaled calamine and does not make as much smoke. If it is in a
frame, which does not break & withstands a , the second
cast comes out neat, because it is imbued with calamine smoke, which
embraces & receives the second one. Sal ammoniac alone, put in
latten, renders it net & shiny. Huile tingente  even more
so. It does not need any sand other than the previous in noyau 
& that the mold be red like for gold. Make many vents. And if you
cast yellowed latten with the prepared tutty, you will not have any bad
smoke.


This metal is very fanciful to cast, because of the calamine smoke, and
one ought not leave it pass  rest even a little bit outside
the fire, like some do with silver, for it is immediately cold when it
feels the air and the wind. It always leaves some type of tail, like
glass, when you cast it. Casters do not usually take such yellow latten,
because of the calamine passed through the fire. But when wanting to
cast red copper, they yellow it either with fresh calamine, or with
prepared tutty. Wanting to cast, one purifies it well of charcoal, with
a stalk of copper or iron, and one covers it with a cloth, soaked in pig
fat, mixed with saltpeter or sal ammoniac to keep it from the wind &
from cooling. 
</div> 137r
<div>For casting in red copper 
Pure red copper from a cauldron or other thin works is appropriate
for casting. And to make it run, throw in some sal ammoniac & when
you are ready to cast, put in a little fine tin & very little. And
note that one needs to cast copper very hot in the mold, which needs to
also be inflamed & entirely red like for gold, silver, latten &
metal. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it is smooth, thin
& shiny like a mirror de cu  of steel, newly polished, or
like melted silver. Keep it from the wind, for it will quickly cool. Fix
the cast with tows or  to keep it from cooling. Red copper
comes out more neatly than latten, which has strong smoke that prevents
it from running. I molded it in noyau  neatly like the principal
one & thin like paper. It is necessary that it be so hot that it is
white & shiny & polished like melted silver and like a mirror. I
cast it in the same sand as above in noyau .


Copper and latten are the longest to melt, longer than any other metal,
especially red copper. But also it flows & comes out very neat,
provided that it is cast very hot, that it is like water.


Removing your mold from the fire, plant it in es  a brazier,
that fills a pot or a vessel.
</div><div>Huile tingente  to make metals run
Take some ☿   sublimate of Venice, true &
not arsenic sublimate, pea size, aes ustum, pea size, sal ammoniac, pea
size. Pulverize everything separately & next mix everything in a
glass bottle & put on hot ash. You will see that everything
dissolves like wax, making many colors. Let it everything  set
& put a little of it on each melted metal & it will run
marvelously.
Founders , with large casts for statues, throw in much tartar,
to clean it of its filth & nastiness & much sal ammoniac to
render it thin & neat. And when they want to cast, they put in much
tin. The cold & humidity strongly disagrees with it, which renders
dangerous the work of the founder, for one only needs a spring of water
in the pit to lose everything.
</div><div>Clamps
They are made with flat pincers of iron wire, reheated &
refolded then beaten at the ends, on the anvil. When they are thusly
fine, they are subject to burning, being put often in the molds for
reheating. Therefore use the new ones.
 </div> 137v
<div>Tempering sand  for molds of flat medals
Flat medals, of wax  or metal , are oiled very lightly
& then are touched with a pinceau  of eau-de-vie. And in
order that the mold, wet with water, takes without refusing the oiled
thing, one heats the water well for wetting the sand, for with cold
water it would refuse. Medals are oiled because they are not malleable
& thusly, could break the mold. And animals, which are malleable, do
not want to be oiled. Hot water should be of such heat that you cannot
hold your finger there, without feeling strong heat. Wet your sand
thicker for flat medals & solids than for lizards & fine things.
Your sand, having set, clean & scrape your mold on one side &
the other & make a notch at the foot & the border of the medal
on the side of the gate, in order that you can take it away better.
Lower also the mold, scraping the surround of the medal, in order that,
from all sides, you can take it away without it corrupting the mold.
Next, make your scorings around d’un  the first cast mold
mes , in order that the second cast joins with it without
varying, & especially make a notch at the bottom of the mold where
the head of the molded thing is. Make some also at the sides of the
gate. This done, dip the reverse of the first mold in water, oil it,
& thusly it will not be imbibed. Rub the reverse of the medal with
eau-de-vie & secondly cast, wetting in hot water. If you have molded
a medal en noyau , having made the first cast & this one
having set, outline, with the point of a knife, the surround of the
medal, in order that it is raised on the cast & and not buried in
it. Then having made the second cast, & having opened your mold,
have  take away the medal, in one go, with one  two
knife points q , and that one takes it from the side of the
gate & the other from the side of the head, which is opposite.

Take care not to oil your medal too much, for if the oil seeps out, it
diverts the sand from becoming smooth & amassing & makes it wavy
& lumpy. One should only touch the middle of the medal d’un
p  with the point of an oiled pinceau , & then spread
the oil everywhere.


Make especially sure that the gate be the widest you can p 
towards the medal & embraces it well, that the entrance of the gate
is ample, always narrowing towards the medal. Do not forget also to
notch the entrance of the gate.
 </div> 138r
<div> If you want to cast gold , silver , copper  or
latten , it is necessary that they be perfectly red, &
inflammed on the inside when you cast, & perfectly reheated two
times, if there is something inside to be burnt & cleaned.
The molds of animals that one burns must be reheated in such a way
that the animal burns. But if it has big bones, it is troublesome to
pull out & ☿   often breaks some fine things
by its weightiness. One does not put ☿  in molds
that can open. This readily happens with flowers, the mold of these does
not open because they are made all in one go.
When you want to reheat your molds, put the clamps on the joints, in
order that, when reheating, they do not bend, contract or break. This is
done after the gate is made.
The scrapings of the mold can still be used, using them in place of
brick , after having reheated them, & also the pieces of the
molds that have been used. One lutes with it also important things, like
works of gold or silver. One also reheats it, & prepares it with
se  water of sal ammoniac, as spat from Germany, & it is
excellent sand  for frames for all metals.
The molds of things where one needs to burn them inside, do
souf  not open until the things which are inside are burnt,
like with molds of crayfish, crabs, stag beetles, representations &
pieces of sulphured black wax, which do not release well.
One ought not to mold on brick  or wood  because they
l’ea  drink & attract water too soon, and do not allow the
sand to set. It would never be better than on a fresh clay  slab.
Yet, I have experienced that grey earth  dries the mold too soon.
The yellow  one is better.

For medals, and flat things, it is necessary that the sand  be
thick enough, wet, because it sets quickly. And when the sand  is
thusly thick, one can hit and shake the table where the mold is placed,
to make it run everywhere. But when the sand  is thin, like for
flowers and plants, one ought not to hit, nor when there is something
attached with wax or another thing that is subject to coming off, like
crayfish legs or similar things. And if the sand is, by chance, too
thick, you quickly put in it some <corr>pour </corr> water.
Having put the sand  in water, le  examine that it is
thick at the bottom & thin on top. The thinnest is cast at the
beginning and then becomes porous & the thickest at the end in order
to fortify the mold.
</div> 138v
<div>Talcum  mixed in the molds
I took the one from which I had pulled the oil . I crushed it
very finely even more s  into a steel  mortar with a
pestle, very lumpy like a file. I rendered it very fine & in a
cottony & downy powder. I mixed it with sand  & mixed it
together & cast it in noyau . It molded en no

</div><div>Gold  cast very thinly
When goldsmiths have something to solder quickly and do not have
time to forge it, they melt some from gold, and then throw it on a cloth
or other things that withstand the fire, and they flatten it immediately
with a hammer or similar thing. And it ends up very thin & even
receives the impression of the cloth.
Fine gold , not alloyed, can be cast for medals, but not for
plants & lizards & very fine things if it is not alloyed.
A pansy  smeared with wheat oil  can be cast in alloyed
gold .
And other thin leaves , but only if the branch is not too big,
and the leaves, especially, cast, can be soldered.
</div><div>Counterfeit diamonds put in a work

join the edge of the setting to the stone  in order that
daylight  does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
stone , which would break.

<div>Casts of lead  and tin 
<add>When it is often melted, it becomes brittle & fl 
frangible, because it is cast very hot & renders it half calcined.
Therefore, use new ones. </add>
The alloy that I have put in use for lizards & snakes is two
℥  of fine tin for one lb  of new & unadulterated
lead. The mold is made of the above said sand, common to all metals,
when it is reheated let it cool until you can hold your finger without
harm in the hole of the gate. As for lead, one melts it in a crucible
ju  in the fire, with bellows, until the crucible & the
lead are red. When it is in this state, purge it again of charcoal,
either with a scraper made for this purpose or with the wind of a little
bellows. l  This done, let it rest thusly red & reheat a
little on its own, then throw in, if you want, a little resin, to burn
the filth. However some find it better not to put any in, because it
leaves filth. But, when they are ready to cast, they ought not to forget
to throw inside as well, as big a bean of looking-glass tin for each
lb  of lead, and that it e  should be red like melted
metal when it enters in the mold. And if the mold is big, it is better
to put it in a press, in order that it joins well & that the lead
does not spread at all outside the mold. However, should this happen
& that for the first or second or third time your mold were not
full, cast boldly, for, provided that your metal is red, it will set
again & join with the other, and come out very neat, like the
principal one. The same can be said for fine tin for thin things. And
the alloy of fine tin is one ℥  of new lead for one lb 
of this. Large molds should be placed in very tight presses, between two
sheets of copper pu  & then bury them in the sand, which
is better than ash, because i l est  by its weight
it seals better. Otherwise these large molds are subject to opening
slightly by the weight of the metal. Some make square pots

When the medal is thick, one is not bound to casting as hot as when it
is thin.
+ 
Note that if you want to cast with cuttlefish bone , they ought
not be very hot, because they will burn the cuttlefish bone . Test
for this effect with paper. If it reddens the paper, it is enough, it is
good to cast, but if it blackens the paper, it is too hot.

@If you want to cast a written paper, make your alloy with
plom  half lead & half tin & as soon as it is melted,
cast between two carton , in a very flat & level place &
with a point of gold or hard wood, etch on the left the writing that you
want. And having poured lead on a carton , press on top with the

</div><div>Cast of wax  to represent an animal that one has not
got
Take some white wax  which is more appropriate for this work
than anything else, because it is firmer & does not leave as much
filth, as much as you need to mold the animal that you propose, & no
more, and half as much charcoal, pestled & finely passed through a
linen or a sleeve. The charcoal gives color and body to the wax, which
would otherwise be transparent & the features would not be seen as
well. Therefore, put your wax  to melt in the fire or charcoal.
And as it is well melted & liquid, have, for a bowl with handles
full of melted wax, as much sulphur la  as a large
walnut. Pulverize it, melt it over a slow fire & when it is melted,
do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hard, but take it
away, & always agitate it with a little stick & let it finish
its bubbling & as it is liquid as water, throw it in the wax 
that you have removed from the fire. And mix & always stir the one
& the other, in order that they mix well. Next, mix in, always
stirring & in several goes, the above said pulverized charcoal
<corr>in several goes </corr>. And as it will be well
incorporated, take heed if your wax has passed its high heat, which you
will recognize when it no longer smokes, when, pulling at the edges, it
makes large tracts <add>se</add> re ,&
unmoving, & close de  one to another. For, if you were to
cast too hot, you could not separate your wax from the mold, & it
would set in the cast. When it is in this good state, stir it with a
little stick, in order that the pulverized charcoal is everywhere &
not placed at the bottom. And in this way, cast in your mold, little by
little, & not in one go, because the wax, by its unctuousness, does
not flow 

This black sulphured wax  is for modelling round figures that are
not for releasing, and that one needs to burn in the mold à
noyau  before opening it, po  like those which have arms
& legs out front or entwined. And then this wax, by means of
sulphur, melts with very little heat, and exits without leaving any
filth. If, by chance, the pestled charcoal remains there as ash, by
opening the mold & blowing inside, it stays neat.

@To make snakes with wax, or another thing to fix on a candle, one needs
to cast with modelling wax, in all colors.
</div> 140r
<div>  like other things, & on this occasion, you can cast in two or
three times until your mold is full. As for the mold which is of white
plaster, pulverized & reheated as for previous sands, you should
have made it a long time ago, for it serves several times. But before
you use it, soak it for a good hour in cold water & for at least as
long in water so hot, that, at the beginning, you cannot hold your
finger in it. And q  take heed that it does not imbibe
b  more,thusly  but rather that it shows itself to
be very wet everywhere, without the water being imbibed in it. And,
removing it from the hot water, closed, cast your wax in such a state of
heat as has been said. And readily, neither the first nor second cast
come out until the mold is imbibed. Let it cool before opening it, in
order that the cast thing does not break. You will recognize that the
cast is good when the wax spilled out onto the outside of the mold is
thin and smooth. Remember to make many gates all along the mold, in
order that the wax run better thusly.
Make the first

  gate twice as large as for other molds. And if, in the first
cast, your work becomes porous and does not come out neat,
  , it is all the same, for it is necessary that you
realise that the three of four first ones are not readily good. In the
first one, you recognize if there are some flashings, which keep from
releasing well and you remove them if they do not remove themselves at
the second or third first cast. And the more you cast, the neater you
will make it, and your mold will serve you for more than a hundred
times, if it is well overseen. But it is good to soak it one night ot
one day before casting in it, in order that it be well imbibed. The same
must be done for fruits of sugar. This wax is very doulce  &
amiable & pliant as copper, and if it is strong because of the
sulphur, which renders it melted, far before the other, that you can
thusly prove on a hot slate. And the sulfur  that you will have
put in it, will be found, the second time that you melt it, cracked at
the bottom. Having thusly passed through the wax, it does not inflame
from a candle. And on this occasion, que  I think it will cast
very neatly for medals. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to
etch  

When your animal is cast, cut with a hot penknife the flaws &
superfluous things. And if you want to refold it & twist it around
on some stick or taper, put it to soften sur  in hot water,
and hold it while twisting it around.

Cut down the protuberance of the gates, in order that they are smooth
& that the wax has more of the silver to run, in one go, without
turning around in the folds of the snake.

etch on silver  & copper  with aquafortis. With this
also, one takes the hollow of the relief & then one throws in this
hollow some wet sand, which immediately represents the relief very
neatly. And then, you can cast on this one, the hollow of this one in
copper, gold and silver, and make seals of great singularity.

</div><div>For casting in sulfur 


To cast neatly in sulfur , arrange the bread pith  under the
brazier, as you know. Mold in it what you want & let dry & you
will have very neat work.


Try sulfur  passed through melted wax , because it no longer
inflames & and no longer makes eyelets.
</div><div>Molding and shrinking a large figure


Mold it with bread pith , having come from the oven, or as the
above, & in drying out it will shrink & consequently the medal
that you will cast. You it  can, by this means, by elongating
and widening the imprinted bread pith , vary the figure & with
one image make many various ones. Bread coming from the oven is better.
And the one that is reheated twice retracts more. You can cast sulphur
without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry, if you want to mold as
big as it is. But if you want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more
or less.
</div><div>Cast of lead  and tin  in plaster 


If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very
weighty, and that does not need to burn in the mold, you can cast in
plaster  & brick  mixed like above, and not in
plaster  alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if
it does not have a companion. But, with brick , it holds well.
However, take heed to dry out your mold at length & on a slow fire
& with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But when your
work is of flowers  or other things that want to be 
their molds reheated & set ablaze, mix in some alum de plume 
& even some crocum . I have molded in plaster  &
brick  very neatly & it withstood several castings.


I tried plaster  & brick  alone and molded en
noyau  like others. My mold was very neat, having lightly
oiled  & rubbed with eau-de-vie my medal. I made my gate ample
at the entrance, narrowing it until the medal, which was very thin. I
notched the gate which embraced well the medal. I dried the mold well on
a slow fire & at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let
it cool in such a way that I could hold my finger to it without burning
myself. I made an alloy of 4 ℥ of tin , & six deniers 
of lead . I cast red, and it came out well. I put in, afterwards,
for 4 ℥ of tin  xii deniers  of lead, it came out very
well.


When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat
it for lead  & tin . But for flowers  & what
should burn, yes.

<div>Molding a crayfish 
If some little thing is missing from it, you can
reattach it or else fill it with goldsmith 's
cement .
Thecrayfish  is one of the most fanciful to mold, but also
provides an example for casting many other very difficult things. Males
are distinguished by the eggs that females carry, and by the four
legs  little white leglets at the back that males
ap  have inside their tail, after the eight main legs. It is
only a good thing to dry them out a little, because the lumps only come
out hard  rougher & more beautiful, for everything that is
of shell does not diminish. It is true that if you let them dry too
much, these little inside leglets diminish & rendered more slender
& do not have as much body. If also they are too dry, the flesh
separates from the scales. Take heed, therefore, to use the average.
They have some hair between the legs & at the end of the tail. And
because all hair is troublesome to mold, because it gets mixed up with
the sand & is not released, you can burn it with a hot iron on the
crayfish , so that no one sees it. As for animals that have hair
or feathers, it is necessary that you smear them with oil of olive,
of wheat , which is quickly dry & which will keep the hair flat
& spread out. Thus, you will have the form of your animal and the
hair will also show, but made in waves, and this is something which can
be repaired. If your crayfish  has eggs, which are delicate, and
which would be awkward to uncover without breaking, you would do better
to make the first cast on the belly & eggs, in order that
te  you only need to uncover the back, which is hard &
easy to handle. And the belly & the eggs will remain in the mold,
and one will need to burn them inside before opening your mold
& en  for the second time. Thus, all  it will
open easily, for what is burned will no longer be attached. Thus, the
second cast, which is made on the first one, which has set well,
separates easily from the first, after having been reheated, which is a
singular secret for similar molds.
The gate is made by the tail, very
thin.
Do not forget to rub with eau-de-vie before
molding.
Stag beetles , crayfish 
& crabs  are molded in the same way.
If your crayfish a d 
has no eggs, mold the back on top & the belly on the bottom. You can
give it some.
It can be molded hollow as for the body,
but the legs cannot. And to do it well, crayfish  are already
fanciful enough to mold without looking for the hollow, this ought to be
reserved for turtles .
When you open your mold, you will find
the crayfish  with white bones, but not in powder. And without
opening it, the ☿   will have done nothing.
Layer these oily colors very
transparently.
To paint it, boil it with wine  & a
little salt  in order that they become very red & take this as
a model. Paint the back with vermeillon   mixed with
lake , & the sides & underneath the belly & the legs
with vermeillon  & yellow ochre  and white .
 </div> 141v
<div> Having therefore let your crayfish  dry a little in the sun
or on its own, if it has eggs, they will shrink while drying and will
only be more beautiful. Therefore make your slab of yellow potter’s
earth, like for other figures, lay your crayfish  on top, the
s  back on top  on the bottom, & the legs, belly
& eggs, which are all the most fanciful parts to mold, on the other
side and on the top. Push the back down in the slab of clay, up to near
the legs, which is about halfway. And fix the body with an iron point in
the middle & if it seems necessary, another, at the end of the tail.
And in order that the big legs show themselves lower than the head,
which is enf  half sunken, extend them & from underneath
add to them a little clay to raise them. Hide also the horns in the
clay, under the big legs, to arrange them afterwards as you will like.
As for small legs, extend them on the clay until the joint, and the
other half of the legs remain above, curved, for the first cast.
However, in order that they do not move & detach, secure them well,
not only on the clay, but att  fix them with wax & a
little hot iron straight in the joints. And if you want to find the most
fanciful cast, you can attach the end of one of the legs with the same
wax on the body, or on one of the big legs, and aso make, if it has
eggs, the tail to be half folded on the eggs, & fix it in this form
with an iron wire point. Take special heed, since the thing is
s  thusly arranged, that it can be well cleaned. Lastly,
having rubbed the crayfish with eau-de-vie, cast your sand. Having set,
uncover the back of the crayfish, the head & the eyes & its
little pincers, the big legs and the small legs all along, for one needs
to uncover the most that one can, both the long horns & the tail,
except if you have folded & curved it to hold the eggs. Other
animals
Secure what has detached, like the hairy
brows near the mouth, with some melted wax underneath.
 Uncover the most that you can, but take
heed that the notching that you make in the mold will release well.
Make the mold lean on the side that is
the thickest of the animal.
To paint it, one does the middle of the
back mixed  with vermeillon  , mixed with a
little lake , and the sides & the belly & underneath the
legs is of a carnation made of vermeillon  , white of
ceruse , a little yellow ochre . As in this & all other
things, have always the natural thing in front of you to imitate
it.
Lay the horns on the big legs,
&  or make with whitened latten wire & solder
them.
Take heedd , when modling, to
arrange the legs in such a way that they do not pass the belly of the
crayfish, Aultr  and that, placing them, they sit well on the
belly, otherwise they move. 
 </div> 142r
<div> are not uncovered as much. But because the crayfish  is
awkward to burn & clean, one needs to uncover as much as one can,
especially the little legs until the end, for these are awkward & if
they were not to be uncovered and you were to have to pull them, you
could break something in the mold. While uncovering with the point of a
knife, or even a burin or other clean thing, clean very carefully the
sand which will be in the joints & elsewhere with your little
brushes. And if something gets detached, attach it with wax, as said.
And attach also the horns in the same way. And make also the gate, along
the end of the little legs, with some wax. And fill the holes made by
the iron wire point with it. And once everything is well neat & more
than half is uncovered, oil your ut mold &
n’oubli , after having dipped the reverse in water & do not
forget to oil all the delicate parts which are between the legs and the
little pincers. Then, rub the crayfish with eau-de-vie. And make your
second cast, having flattened the first mold, in order that the clamps
join better. Your mold must be wider on the side that is imprinted, than
the back. Do not open your mold after the second cast unless it has been
luted & reheated & that what is inside is burned. Do not forget
to put crocum among your sand when you mold crayfish, for one needs to
reheat strongly & the crocum withstands marvelously. Molding a crab
& a crayfish is all the same. When you have uncovered your crayfish
on one side, delay the least that you can for making the second cast,
for el  crayfish dry se  out. It is not just about
uncovering the crayfish well, in such a way that you see an entire half,
but take heed that your mold itself, in which you uncover, release well,
for even if the crayfish were well burned, you despoui  would
not be able to open your mold without breaking.
Repair with penknives,    files,
little chaples , or burins &
make all around them, as you see, a gate of
wax  & at the end of the tail, also two or three, whence you
make you make the principal gate.
 Make a gate of wax, elongated in a line,
like a large thread, all along the end of the legs, & at
u  the extremity of the tail. If there is also some piece of
leg or other part that is further away from the line of the others, or
raised above, or folded on its own, give it a gate of wax, which from
its extremity, joins either at the body or at one of the big legs, or at
some other place which receives a lot of metal.
Having uncovered it, attach & secure
with wax the two little hairy horns of the crayfish & other things
which are not <corr>en </corr>despoui  secured at
all.
</div> 142v
<div>Molding grasshoppers  and things too thin
If you have a written paper to mold, which is too thin, after you
have made the first cast & it has set, give a little thickness to
the reverse of your paper  with melted butter , which is the
most appropriate means there is, & for fortifying the wings of
either a butterfly  or a grasshopper , or some delicate
part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to
apply this melted butter  underneath the wing or in whichever
place it cannot be seen. For giving thickness to a pansy or other
flowers, butter  is not good, but rather wheat oil , which
is soon dry & holds firm. Wax  would not be appropriate here
for it is too hot once melted, & it makes the thing to which it is
applied contract. But butter  is amiable and handleable.
If you write on paper  or on common
carton  & that your letter is with gum , the humidity of
the clay  slab or the wet sand for noyau  will moisten
your letter & undo it. Therefore write with cinnabar  wettened
with oil , on oiled & impress.
+ Reheat your molds with
charcoals ,firstly lit in the forge, in order that the fire is not
so hot & does not break the molds. And do not make as much fire
where the mold is thin, like in the place where it is thick.
</div><div>Molds
Make some notches, with these, that enter more in the inside of the
mold than on the outside, for in this way, they have more strenght. Keep
from reheating in on go & in a too ardent fire, for this makes them
melt  break.
Do not keep them in a humid place, nor
enclosed, if they are not well dry, for they will mold. The dried
animals as well.
@One ought not to reheat the molds two
times when the animal can be taken away without burning, as do
toads , which can very well be molded hollow like all thick
animals. However, it is always good to redden the mold once.
</div><div>Lute  for luting  your molds
I have not found one that is made more quickly than this one, nor
better. Take this lean earth  of which the founders of
artillery  & bell  make their trusseaulx  and
molds, which is lean & sandy. Wet it e  moderately like a
very thick mortar . Mix in it about half horse dung  &
then have it beaten well. Next, mix in a third part of discarded
cloth waste  or cloth shavings , and beat it again quite
strongly. You can reheat your mold as soon as the lute  is
placed.
</div> 143r
<div>Moulding turtles 
The water turtle  is more beautiful to mold because it has
prettier scales & straight legs. And those of the garrigue 
have crooked ones. They are long living, getting ready to kill them,
open their mouth & pass a long penknife through all the intestines,
& then make it swallow some vinegar  mixed with
eau-de-vie  or urine , as for snakes. One needs to mold them
in several pieces, & the back itself sometimes, because the sides
for some are more narrow than elsewhere & are not released on this
occasion. To make them die, one ought not boil them, for they come apart
& even the shell, from the hot water . They come out better
hollow, because their great thickness corrupts the mold. Those from
water are more vigorous. Those from garrigue  are thinner,
slower, & more sleepy. If you scratch those of the water on their
shells, however sleepy they are, they move. Those from garrigue 
do not.
They die rather quickly in vinegar 
mixed with a little eau-de-vie  or urine , as with all other
animals.
They keep themselves, in the winter, with
their eyes closed & are as dead, being numbed by the cold. They hide
in the earth or under chaff or warm manure, & live only on the
moisture of the earth .
@One ought not to mold them as soon they
die because they are still too stiff. But on the next day, you will
manipulate them & fold their legs as you wish.
</div><div>Moulders  from Foix 
Those who mould de travers  make their sand with
crocum  & calcined slate , but slate  always
retains its asperity & becomes porous, because it is a fat. In the
noyau , it is not good, in sand, it can be accomodated. They
sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry , and wet it in
water , & they take away the finest, which is on top, then
reheat it.
</div><div>Toad 
Once molded, it can be removed without burning it, because it
releases well. Choose the biggest & the lumpiest. Because they
contain a lot of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, for they come
out better. You could make your cast in one piece & large, but it
s  would be awkward to cut. It is best to do it in three or 4
parts, which will be thicker close to the animal, and include the most
amount of edge that is close to the cast/mold. Make as well some casting
conduits all the way from the end of the cast .
 

Let the mold cool rather than opening it, even for thick things.
 </div> 143v
<div> from one leg to another, so that the spread out limbs are in
connection with one another due to the aforesaid casting conduits, which
you will start in the waxless round parts that you have put at the edge
of the legs to attract the metal. In this way, because you are casting
in wax , there is no danger chipping any part of the molded
animal. It's quicker to make the wax  casting conduits thus,
because in this way you can  cast the second mold after
the first , rather than wait to do them the
conduits  after the mold has been recooked, because then, if
possible, you will need to have everything ready. You need to heat well,
and even redden the molds where there are wax  conduits so that
they melt and leave nothing inside.
</div><div>Carcanets made à jour 
They are molded like crayfish  in noyau , first with
one side being raised up with clay  which is hollow, & then
one uncovers them from the other side & one makes the second
casting. They are also able to be cast well in frames , provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
wax , or else one fills the cavities that were not able to release
with wax  or clay .
</div><div>Iron  filings
Because usually filings  are mixed with nastiness, it is good
to redden them in fire to burn the impurities, and then wash them in
clear water . In this way, the dirt will go to the top of the
water , that you throw out, & the good filings will go to the
bottom.
</div><div>Carnations
Because the ones that are cast are usually massive, ou bi 
they are weighty & for this reason, one makes them with leaves &
blades of silver.
</div> 144r
<div>Turtles 
Turtles are much more beautiful and easier to mould than tortoises,
being that they are flatter and have a longer head and tail, and
straighter legs and release better than tortoises, who are scraggly,
wrinkled, and deeply entrenched in their shells. They
tortoises  also have a rounder top shell which is however
narrower on the sides than in the middle, which means that the top shell
cannot be nicely molded in one go, like those top shells  of
turtles. Thus you will mould the top shell into two pieces, and the
lower shell into two, three, or four pieces according to their
appropriateness. If you want to release your turtle from the mold
without burning it, you must mold it in several pieces. But if you want
to burn what is inside, you can mold your top shell in one piece. So to
get started, once you have completely killed it in vinegar and urine, as
we know, leave it to fully dry out. And clean it well with a cloth. Then
take your clay base place it on it, and scrape the base a bit so that
the undershell fixes in. Having nevertheless previously arranged the
head with a strong needle, as you do with other animals, holding it high
by means of a bit of fresh clay that you will work with from beneath.
Stretch the aforesaid head and legs with your little pincers. Once the
head is in place, dextrously put a grain of yellow millet into each eye
with the pincers, because as soon as they die, the eyes pop out and rot.
You can do the same for any other animal with a large amaranth seed, a
small one, or a grain of rapeseed. This done, you will arrange the legs,
securing them with little iron needles. And then plug with clay the
holes all the empty spaces around the turtle, that is to say, what is in
between the two shells, so that the sand does not hinder the releasing
of it. And because the legs must be lower than the bottom shell, make a
little dimple in your clay base to accommodate them. Your turtle


When they are the well tender and mortifiees & left aside, in two or
three days you will be able to bend and manipulate them better.

  </div> 144v
<div> having been thusly arranged and well cleaned with brushes, put the
circle of clay  around the base. Then, with a roll of clay 
placed on the middle of the back of the turtle , as you can see,
and at the widest place, divide your mold. Next, oil  with your
oiling  brush half the half of the shell you want to mold. If you
sand is a bit thick, temper your sand with warm water , so that
without burning yourself you can put your finger in it without burning
it. And before casting it, rub the shell with spirits . And then
cast your sand and let it take hold. And note that all things that have
shells, or that are hard, or do not yield as snakes  and
lizards  do, must be oiled  to come out cleanly. The
things that yield do not need this. Warm water  means that the
tempered sand sits better on the oil , which otherwise would not
work. With the half turtle  having been thusly molded, separate
it with its mold from its clay  base, which you will put aside to
use when needed. Then clean your half-mold, join it and flatten it like
for the others. But because there will be the roll of clay , the
half mold will have more than just half the turtle  in it, cut
and crop cleanly the excess clay  and clean everything well
with the brushes. Then at the top of the edge of the mold on the side
where it is cut, at the halfway mark, make two notches as you have done
with other molds. And flip the turtle  on its base, as it was,
and secure the two legs that are not molded with iron  pins and
fill the empty areas around it, up to the edge of the top shell with
some clay . Then place the circle around it and place a roll of
clay  on the first mold, a bit above the notches. And having
oiled  the first half-mold and its notches and the shell of the
turtle , and having also sprinkled it with spirits , warm
your water , temper your sand with a bit of salt water ,
ammoniac , and the aforesaid hot water , make your cast.
Having taken hold, keep the sides of the two molds neatly together, and
for each side secure the joints, which are not prone to do so naturally,
with two clamps, so that when you uncover the bottom of the
turtle  the top joint does not open. Then open the side with the
belly and the throat, in the same manner that you would open a
crayfish , which is the hardest animal to mold of all animals
that are molded in two parts.
  You can also mold your turtle 
in one piece for each side, but you will need to burn it. And then to
make the hollow, the recooked mold cannot be well-oiled  because
it absorbs the oil .
+ 

If there is crocum  in your sand, the joints of the molds will not
join well together. 


Turn to the second leaf.
</div> 145r
<div>Casting in three frames
You can cast bronze  mortars and similar things which release
well in three frames. That is to say the body of the mortar in one, its
noyau in the other, and the base of the mortar in the third one, because
otherwise the cast which is there will not release well.

A
</div><div>Cuttlefish bone 
You must not heat the tin  or lead  too hot, otherwise
they will burn the bone  and become lumpy. And to know when it is
the right temperature, dip in it a little piece of twisted paper .
If it turns black without catching fire, it is the right temperature.
But if it burns & catches fire, it is too hot. You can cast
gold  & silver , but it never comes out neatly. To cast
something delicate well, it is necessary that the bone  not be
extremely dry, because it is rough & does not release as well &
crumbles & is brittle. In any case, before you cast, dry them
the bones   & especially for gold , which does
not react well to humidity. You will know that they are dry enough when,
after having exposed the insides and the imprint to the fire, they hiss
& crackle when you bring them near your ear. Now join the
bone s & daub the joints with a little lute  and slowly
dry it near the fire & cast & then shake the mold or scratch the
rough crannies and let it cool down before opening it. Usually one cuts
the bone  in the middle, and the dull part that does not have half
circles   is more delicate and smoother to mold with, and
therefore one always uses it to do the main part of the casting, the
other part of the cuttlefish bone   is crumbly on the
inside as on the outside. Therefore one does not use this to cast
delicate things which need to be molded in two places. One evens out
& flattens these two halves on some piece of wood, then one rubs
some charcoal  on top so that it releases well. And to make sure
the charcoal  is evenly spread everywhere, tap the side of the
hand which is holding the half bone . Both having been covered in
charcoal , take the first bone  that has been prepared &
rounded on the edges, and having placed the medal above it, press the
medal down strongly.
 </div> 145v
<div> But with fingers you cannot press evenly, because if you press on
the edges, the middle will remain hollow. Start therefore with the
middle, & then do the edges. But to do it better, put something flat
& even on the medal, or some large square file, & press with
that; because you will press evenly, sometimes with your knee, other
times with your foot with your shoe taken off. & do it from above,
so that you impress it without breaking it. If it is not well molded on
the first go, do it again several times. Then restore and flatten your
halves of molded bone from the sides. And to cut them well, always start
from the most tractable part, coming out to the shell. And if your medal
does not come out on its own, scratch the rough bone from behind and it
will strip. When you want to cast, settle & affix the two bones with
little pins of wood & in order to cast neatly, you have only to try
it with sand.
</div><div>Moulding herbs and flowers
You do not need thin sheets of clay , because the herbs and
flowers will not lay on it, but as it were in the air, not touching
anything from any side, so you only have need of a circle & contour
that is higher than for flat molds. And in this way, take heed to make
it strong and thick, with the heft that you find suitable. Otherwise, it
will sink in when the sand is inside. Fix & fortify it well with
your foot & firmly attach all the joints. Then, have your flower
well attached & assuredly fixed to the bottom of the casting with
wax  that is not at all rough, but smooth, so that it can strip
off well. Then moisten your flower or herb in good spirits  in a
tall glass.
</div><div>Flowers
+ 

When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves
upright, run a thread through the mold to keep them lest they do not
hoist themselves up. & cast the sand little by little &
continuously and blow on it strongly and constantly so that it covers
everywhere. Otherwise, it will become lumpy. Since you won't put
anything in thin sheets of clay , the mold sometimes sticks to the
table on which you mold. To release it, strike a great blow on the side
of the table with a hammer.
 

It's enough to reheat your clayed mold once for flowers & to heat it
the second time if you cast in tin  & lead , in so much
as for gold  & silver , you have to reheat it
twice.


When very red, cast your tin into the mold when it is so hot that you
cannot?  hold your finger in the hole without  .
 </div> 146r
<div> so that it is wet everywhere. If not, wet it with a large brush
dedicated to this. Then pass the end of an iron  wire that holds
the wax  casting through the end of the mold that closes the
circle and have the iron  cleave the clay  mold as you see;
& position it on the bottom, attending that the herb or flower does
not touch anything, and leave some thickness to your mold, because the
moistened sand always elevates the herb or flower. Even so, if it isn't
thick of its own accord, pass a slender thread through the flower with a
needle to keep it elevated. Or, if you forget this, lower the flower
with a little stick just until the cast sand starts to thicken. With
your flower well-positioned, take a platter large enough to moisten all
the sand that you will need to fill the mold. Put a little sal
ammoniac water  in it, and then some spring water , and when
your platter is almost full, put a sprinkle of your sand on it, &
mix it, & steep it until it becomes totally uniform, because if it
were to clot it would consume the mold. For flowers it does not need to
be very thick. And likewise, at the beginning, when you just barely pour
it so it remains transparent on your flower & covers it sort of half
way, blow strongly everywhere so that you eliminate the little bubbles,
and afterwards finish filling it & blow, always slightly tilting
your mold down towards its larger side. And if you find some remainder
of thick sand that was not well soaked, set it rather close to the
casting than otherwise. Then you can cast some thicker moistened sand to
make it set sooner. I molded a marigold, with its leaves, in this
manner. Crocum ferri  is safer for flowers, and when there is some
crocum , clay it with the same sand that has already been used and
is the most excellent of all.

The stem on which I cast a large branch of marigold with its flower, its
buds and its leaves came out neatly, just like nature, was made of one
lb. of fine tin  mixed with two ounces of lead .


If there are a few froths, fix it with a pen knife.


Uncover the molded flower while gently breaking the mold with the point
of a knife. And, even better, soak it well in water . Afterwards,
try a pig brush at the end of an iron  wire, etc.


When the mold is reheated for the first time, leave it to cool down
halfway. Then, run an iron  wire gentle through the casting to
make an opening for the burned ash inside. Afterwards, blow inside with
a bellows and turn the mold over on the casting to make everything
leave, & sometimes blow and suck in with your mouth.


Heed that you not attach the stem of the flower too firmly to the
casting with wax , lest it consume something when you remove the
wax  from the casting. To remove it, you have to loosen it a bit
all around & then draw it out by the iron  wire with little
pincers.

<div>Moldingturtles 
This page is the continuation of the preceding second page.Since you
have cleanly uncovered the part of the belly of turtle , its
underparts, its throat, and its legs, and having cleaned it all well, do
not forget to neatly uncover the cavity that these animals have in their
shell between the neck and the shoulders. Turtles  do not have
as deep of a cavity as tortoises , which are more scraggly, and
even amongst those, there are some that have a deeper cavity than
others. Do not therefore forget to neatly uncover all of this in order
to better represent its likeness. But if there is a cavity which spirals
too much inside, and is not visible, nor releases well, apply some small
lumps of wax  and with heated needles of thick iron  and
work the aforesaid wax . Then plug the entrance to all of these
cavities with soft clay . Put the circle of clay  around the
mold, which has already been made of two pieces and contains the back of
the turtle . And to mold its belly, you must separate it in
three as you can see. That is to say, you will put a roll of clay 
on top of the throat and another one on the edge of the shell of its
tail, so that only the shell of the entire stomach will be accessible to
be molded on its own. Having oiled  the shell of the belly and
having rubbed it with spirits , thrown you slightly thick sand,
which has been tempered with hot water  as before. Having taken
hold, remove the rolls of clay , then uncover the front and back
legs, that is to say the bottom bit, and the throat and the tail, and
remove the clay of all the cavities in one go if you can, because this
will show you if the cavity will release well. And if the removed
clay  carries with it some of the wax  you have applied, put
it back into the places that did not release well, as has been said. And
if some bit of the turtle  has come away with the clay ,
or fallen off, attach and rejoin it to the mold with some wax ,
using a heated iron  needle. Do not forget to put some melted
wax  at the edge of the turtle 's nails when you cast.
Having molded and uncovered the shell of the belly, you will see the
mold in this way.# 
   </div> 147r
<div> Be warned to make an edge of wax  melted with a warm
wire  all around the edge of the top shell which is close to the
tail in order to make a better cast. And make it so that two small
strings of the same wax  goes from the end of the shell of the
belly to the aforesaid wax  edge, which is around the backbone of
the shell, and the turtle 's tail should stay in between those
two strings. This to make a better cast. This done, oil  your mold
and what you can see of the shell. Put the circle around this, and cast
with hot water  as before, and doing what you have done in the
same manner to mold the third part which is the tail. And having taken
hold, take away the clay  contours, clean your mold, bring it
together, and flatten it on all sides with a knife as you have done with
other molds. Lightly dip it in water , then try to release it.
Usually, one starts by the shell of the back, which is to say the top
mold that is made of two halves. And this one is easier to release. The
other follows directly after, but because it is next to the
turtle 's shoulders which are deeply entrenched, it is sometimes
troublesome to do this when lightly shaking and pulling the mold. Be
advised to pull the easiest one first, because you will need to release
them one after the other. The hardest one of all is the one molding the
throat, the underside of the legs, and the cavities of the shoulders,
which are so difficult to release, that if you do not plan accordingly
by filling it with wax rather than molding what cannot been released, it
will be difficult to take the pieces without breaking something. But if
it happens to you again, there is a solution, provided that you keep the
broken pieces, because you can reassemble them with stong iron needles,
and fill whatever crack or flaw you have with some melted wax and hot
iron as you have with others so that the noyau to mold hollow is easier
to do. After
See the second page
To prevent breaking while releasing, be
advised to uncover up to the point where it can still hold.

I have cast the cleanest I have ever seen, making very small figures

have put into the melted mixture the two compositions which makes
silver  runny, and have done as if I wanted to throw with pure

Beware that it should be three fingers away from the mouth of the
bellows and that the aforesaid bellows is positioned underneath the
bottom of the crucible, otherwise it will cool it down.
</div><div>Latten  casting
I have taken the one you find in latten  skillets, which have
been beaten and forged quite thinly. Having well-heated it, I threw in
two or three grains, like beads of sal ammonicac . This will
clarify it like a mirror, having turned very white from all the heating,
I threw in it some crushed raw and pure calamine . The I casted it
in its very red mold. Il cast cleanly and thin like paper , and
hollow on the back. Because it has become crusty I cooked it again,
which to means to say, I reddened it, and left it to cool, then put it

Do not let it cool down when melting. It
always makes into filaments, as you would find with melted glass ,
because of the calamine . Usually, the soft letten  of
skillets, becomes red from casting, even when it has been in the fire

letten  of candleholders becomes yellow, as well as the
filings  made of needles.

</div><div>Whitening  
If it is for silver , do not pestle your tartar  with
iron , but with the handle of a hammer, for if you touch & dip
iron  in your whitening, the silver  would become red like
copper  & you would need to reheat it & put it again in
whitening . Mix nothing with your tartar  that should not
enter the whitening , for this corrupts it. Do not let it spill
out of its first boil, for in this is all its strength. The
whitening  is made with one part pulverized tartar  & a
half of common salt .
</div><div>Moulding the foot of the bittern, or of the eagle, or of other

of the foot in two, and the bottom in one piece.

To make this quickly, redden the filings  in an iron 
case, stirring it often. Then sprinkle it with good vinegar  &
let it evaporate & without removing it from atop the fire,
rou  let it redden & inflame. Once cooled, pulverise it on
the marble  & return it to the fire, sprinkle with
vinegar , and then inflame. Thus it will quickly be colored &
made fine.
</div> 148v
<div>Molding turtles 
Join the parts of your mold and fix very carefully clamps on all
joints, which are on the top, the bottom and the sides of the mold; do
not forget to notch the joints as you did with the other moulds. Once
you have fixed all the clamps, remove the sides ones, not the others.
Thus your mold, made of several pieces, will open as if it was only made
of two parts. If you want to mould hollow, pierce a hole big enough to
thread the end of your little finger in the middle of your mold's belly.
Widen the outside of the hole, like clervois, in order to cast the core.
You could avoid all these difficulties if you didn't mold hollow; you
could then mold your turtle  in two pieces, more quickly, and
burn it inside of the mold like other animals. But a turtle  is
weighty, and would be heavy if not molded hollow. This is why it is
considered better to mold it that way. It takes three days to make the
proper hollow  mould. To mold hollow and fantastic
forms , you need very strong plaster  which can
withstand fire without bursting. But if you can't get this kind of
plaster , add to it a little more stone alum , and also add
crocum , which fortifies it the plaster   and
makes the flaws -- if there are any -- so fine that they can be easily
removed. Do not forget to tighten your mould with a press in order to
avoid flaws that happen when your mold is not tight enough, or when it
bursts. To repair it, if the lines are not apparent enough retrace with
a burin, then soften the lines with a ciselet. You can remove the flaws
with a chaple, a kind of burin. For the lumps and crumbly bits, they can
be made with a gadet or a small carving tool which isn't hammered, and
hitting with a small file.
Make this hole before joining the
mould.

<div>Softening iron  and rendering it very soft
Take sublimate , quicklime , soap from
Venice  , horse dung , a little less sublimate 
than the others. Wet all of this together like paste & with this
impaste the iron , & to do this envelope it with some bad
linen. Then make it reheat until it is very red. Or leave overnight in a
good fire until the morning. It will be very soft for engraving on it
well whatever you want.
</div><div>Base gold from Germany , electre  
One calls it gold  from the Rhine , which one finds in
the rivers, and is spangle gold. Goldsmiths  from
German  wanted to refine it, thinking to separate it from this
whiteness which they deemed to be silver . But it always remains
whiteish, which demonstrates that this whiteness is fixed & it does
not lack color. This is electre  , from which one is able
to make cups, which will demonstrate poison.
</div><div>Various arts from Germany 
They are very much helped by water mills, & most of the artisans
of metals, of gold , & of silver , & others, at the
trip hammers, make  get their large works beaten. And to draw
thread from iron , they redden large masses of iron , &
having made it into a point, they make it hang while totally red, &
thus promptly draw the thread.
</div><div>Repairing a medal

<div>Molding vases in several pieces
Goldsmiths  who work in grand works and plate get whatever
wooden forms they please turned on a lathe. And then, with some
wax , they model on top masks, festoons, and whatever they please.
And they mold next, in three, in four, or several pieces.

They take on a gold denier  a grain  of the
fine aloé  , like old douzains   are.
</div><div>Molding a fly 
Large flies  can be molded & g  made by
casting. But one needs par d  to grease underneath their wings
with wheat oil , which dries quickly and fortifies them &
gives them a little thickness. The same is done to butterflies ,
cicadas , grasshoppers , & similar things. But to
cast them more easily, one applies them on some leaf or bouquet. The
others are made by hand with a very thin silver  blade. <add>One
ought not to keep them once dead, because they dry out and their legs
break.</add>
Wheat oil  is put underneath delicate things to render them more
rigid & firm & to make them hold their natural position. Because
being weak & delicate, the wet sand, weighting down their tops,
would change their form.
</div><div>Bat 
They have very thin wings, & if they are large & dry and
their wings extended, one would need a very large mold & it would
not be certain that the metal  would run sufficiently. Thus, when
you want to mold them, choose the medium-sized ones & make the pose
qu  so that they have their wings half folded. Because in this
way they will come out better, but support the side of the wings with
wax , as you know, to feed the cast well.

<div>Very strong wax 
Mix with this resin  and bole , and do not cast it very
hot.
</div><div>Various alloys of tin  and lead 
For hollow things like turtles , half fine lead  and
half tin .
For flowers, almost all tin , namely a lb  of fine
tin  and two ℥  of fine lead .
For lizards  that are as thick as one or two fingers, almost
all lead , namely a lb  of fine lead  and 4
℥ es  of fine tin .
</div><div>Molds
They are less subject to cleaving while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than when they are of a little thickness, provided that
the thickness is sufficient. For when thin, they scarcely need to be
rehea  on the fire, & a long time on the fire makes them
corrupt, especially when the plaster  is not strong.
It is better to reheat a mold on its own than several together,
because one needs a larger & more violent fire for several than for
one. And, glowing charcoal  stopping up the space between the
molds, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such a way that
more often you will find your molds burst & cleaved open on one side
more than another.
Therefore reheat your molds alone, not making fire there, except to
cover it.
And because your lead  and tin  become sour when
frequently melted red, to soften it melt it without reddening it and
cast in a rod.
Brick cools the metal , & if this was for giving a bond,
it will not be necessary.


The reheated molds cannot withstand several casts. But those in which
one wants to cast only lead  or tin <corr>and </corr><add>or</add> flat medals, having been only
dried, withstand many.


Very finely ground iron scales  render them very firm &
strong.

 150v
<div>Molding hollow
This iron  thread needle which you put thusly in the mold, is
to better secure the noyau and keep it from shifting. All of this having
been thusly arranged, lay your mold on the table, hole facing upwards,
as it is explained at the side. And then fashion a circle made of soft
clay , of about two fingers high around the hole, as you have done
with other molds. And then temper your molding sand to an average
thickness, and throw it in the hole until it mold  is very
very full, that is to say until you reach the clay  circle. Be
advised not to throw it sand  in the middle of the hole, but
from the sides, because the already made mold, will drink and suck the
moisture. And the new sand that you throw on the sides of the mold,
because drying quickly, will plug the mold and not leave you enough
time  to fill up. Whereas if you throw it the sand  from
the side, when you realize it is drying too quickly  and plugs
up, you can make a path for it. Having thrown it in, blow on the
tempered sand, and insert the tip of your finger in the hole a few
times, or some kind of pointy thing to keep it moist, in order to make
sure that the hollow wax  does not fill up. At the end throw in
the thicker tempered sand to strengthen the mold, because when
water  rises up to the edge of the mold, it always makes it
softer. Having taken hold, get rid of the clay  circle and any
raised parts that relate to the hole through which you threw the noyau,
and you will not even realize the process took place. Once your mold has
been thusly prepared, lute its outside with the same sand that you used
to make the mold. Then reheat it on with a low heat to begin with, slant
the mouth of the cast downwards so that the wax  trickles out
slowly, because if you reheat it over very high heat to make the
wax  come out, it will boil inside it the mold , and
will leave blisters and lumpy bits on it the cast , as long
as


This iron  thread needle is placed in the middle and the hole of
the cast, when the mold is in many pieces, as is the one for
turtles . And you do this so that the noyau does not shift. But
when the mold is made out of only two pieces, it is not necessary to put
needles in the middle.

  
Rather than cast the noyau, make some
notches around the edge of the hole through which you would like to
cast, so that your mold is even more secure.
Mixed tallow  means that when you
empty your wax  when you are emptying the mold of wax , it
does not clog.
You will need half tallow  and
half black wax .
Every thick piece comes out better when
molded hollow, because a thick mass of mostly lead will stay warm for a
long time and eat away at the mold.
After the cast, you can mold the part of
the shell of the belly where you made your hole on the real thing
animal  and fix it with solder .
X Note that after your noyau has been cast, it is better
to put your mold in hot water  to open it, so that you can take
away as much wax  as you can, always softening it in the hot
water . Because the less wax  you have on it, the better it
is, because it will reboil when you reheat your mold, and you will get
blisters and lumps. And if you have little wax  left in the
mold  you will not need to reheat it as much. When you open your
mold the cast will break. But it can easily be repaired as long as you
castA 
 </div> 151r
<div> the white wax  you have used to make black sulfured wax 
has so little substance, being dry and purified, that it leaves nothing
with it the mold mentioned in the first part of this recipe 
and trickles very gently. As for the coal  which is mixed in it,
if there is some left, it burns and reduces to ash, and can be taken out
afterwards by blowing into the cast. You can open your mold after the
wax  has been melted, if it does not contain a fantastical piece
which could break, which are like pieces added on or similar. After
having covered the clamps with lute  from your sand, and having
covered the entire mold, add to this a layer of common luth , and
then sprinkle ground brick  so that you can better manipulate it.
Leave the lute  to dry slowly, rather than putting it in the fire,
which will melt the wax . The wax , having exited the cast,
that which remains of it, mixed up with the charcoal , will burn.
Having reheated it for the first time, lute  it again, because
should your plaster  be bad, it will have eaten away at the mold
and it will be found in the space between joints, which can result in
large overflow. And for the second time, you must not reheat it if you
want to cast only in lead  or in tin , simply make sure that
the lute  is very dry and your mold attains an average heat. For
those very large turtles  that have enough thickness, it is
better to cast using an alloy of half tin  and half lead ,
as you do with hollow things. Because if you only need to cast very thin
and fragile things like flowers, rely instead on using more lead 
than tin , which bubbles when cast a bit thickly and will easily
some flaws to your cast. Master Alexander says he has never gone astray
with using half tin  and half lead  for things that are
heavy and as thick as the back of a knife. If there is crocum ,
you will not be able to clearly see the joints and as a consequence the
metal overflow is very small and thin. You can repair this, and through
the hole of the belly draw out the earth from the noyau, leaving it to
soak for a long time.
When you have thrown your black wax 
in the mold and it has well-cooled, you will have to open half of your
mold to make your cast. Should your black wax  figure break, there
is no danger, because it can always be reattached with a hot iron 
needle. Or if the pieces have not separated well from their mold, they
will meet up and join as before, by joining and tightening the two
halves of the mold. When your figure is big, you must interweave more
iron  threads inside to give support to the noyau.

 
A only in lead or in tin. You must however heat the mold
as much as if you were about to burn an animal inside, so that the
wax  melts well and leaves nothing inside, and trickles out while
holding the mold slanted towards the cast and at the same time reheating
it. And when the mold has been reheated, leave it to cool slowly, then
blow inside and suck out the wax ashes. Do this with a bellows.
 </div> 151v
<div> However, do not remove it before you have prepared the whole
turtle , because you will use this earth  as
cement , should you need embed something or make repairs with a
chisel. If you have some metal overflow at the joints of your mold, you
will remove it, either with a burin, called a chaple, or with a very
sharp pen-knife, or with a small file followed by the chisel. Always
keeping in front of you the real thing to do as best you can. You can
curl on a file a chisel point, which is not at all moistened, to make
something lumpy. For these turtles  and any other hollow things
which you can assume are quite big, create a ligue  of half
lead  and half refined tin . There is more to do when
molding a turtle  than when molding a dozen flowers. If there is
crocum  in your sand, there will be no metal overflow and if you
are unfortunate enough that there should be some on the sides, these
will be as thin as paper , as long as your mold is very tightly
pressed together. And to make the scales of turtles  and other
animals, you can make little chisel marks in the shape of round punch
cutters, others in the shape of a gouge, or shaped like a snake 
or lizard  scale, and other using a file used to make twisty
bits and lumps. Turtles  that do not need to be molded hollow
are not as much work, because they are molded in two pieces and repair
them with little chisels that make  punch cutters, little
couge, and serrated chisels.

 
</div><div>Wheat oil 
One needs to make it between two quite sparkling hot iron 
blades, especially the lower one, which will be sloping, on which you
will put some wheat, quite even & uniform. And then you will place
the other, all red, on top, & you will press it until you see the
black oil  drip well. Reiterate that until you have enough of it.
This oil  dries immediately. It gives gold color to
silver -plated & burnished things, augments the color of
gilded things, serves as a varnish  on iron  for engraving
it later, for varnishing sword guards tawny. And could also serve
makers of gilded leather   well. 
One needs to use it when it is newly
made. And for things to be molded, it must not be as thick as for
coloring.


It is not for oiling hairy animals, for
it is too strong & rigid, but it is good to give form to the legs of
a small animal, like a fly  & suchlike. It is also excellent
for coloring white false stones.
</div> 152r
<div>Molding a rat 
The hairs of his whiskers are difficult to come out of the mold, you
can therefore shave them with fire, as did the tyrant of
Syracuse , which you can always replace with life-like
silver  ones. The tail comes out beautifully because it is made of
little scale-like circles, almost like the ones of a lizard .
And to make sure that the hair does not keep you from molding well, burn
them away with a little candle. The rest of the body must be oiled with
wheat oil , which will keep the hair rigid and flat, so that it
will not be removed when it mixes with the sand, which will keep you
cast from releasing cleanly. Wheat oil , being dry, will dry
quickly, you will therefore be able to comb the hair with a very fine
comb, so that the hair will be visible when cast. On a small
mouse  you can use common oil  to flatten the hair. Rather
than molding these animals immediately (except for snakes  and
lizards ), keep them dead for a day a two so that they become
easier to handle. Because they are very stiff after they die and cannot
be shaped into a life-like looking position unless they are softened.
However, if you mold it straight after it dies, and give it its shape
before it becomes stiff, that will be good. And because the eyes die
unless you mold them immediately, you can replace them with half a round
pea  taken out of its shell. Some cast their rats  without
any added preparations; others oil them with olive oil  which
suits the purpose, because wheat oil  is thick and has too much
body. This is why we only use it wheat oil  in light strokes
on fly 's feet or beneath a wing, to keep them stiff. Others
flatten the hair with an egg yolk , which dries quickly and does
the job. Arrange it the rat   on its clay  base
before oiling it. Raise its head with an iron  needle, and also
secure its feet with needles, and it tail. Rub it with spirits 
after the oil  has dried. Then throw in your sand. Uncover it as
you would other animals, then do your second casting. You must not open
the mold until it is completely reheated and the rat  has burned
away.
+ If it is a big
rat , it is better to cast it hollow, because it is thick. A
mouse  is easier to mold because it has shorter hair. It is
impossible to mold an animal with big bones well, such as a bird or
rat , without opening the mold to clean it well, because bones
do not burn well.
All kinds of feathers and hairs are
difficult to mold realistically.
It is better to use butter  to
grease hairy animals than wheat oil , because it is better suited
to the purpose.
If the rat  is big, it is better
to remove its entrails, or having molded it, let it dry in an oven,
because the large amount of moisture it contains would boil inside the
mold, which would ruin it and make it lumpy.
Only put your mold in the oven after it
has cooled, drying slowly, otherwise it will absorb the moisture and
break.
</div> 152v
<div>Repairing things that have been cast


It happens often that what you have cast has metal overflow, through a
fault in the mold, the cast, or the metal . Faults in the mold
arise from plaster  which is not hard and strong and cannot
withstand fire, which is corrected by mixing in crocum . If you
use too much tin  to cast things that are of an average thickness,
it will not release well, because tin that is cast thickly, shrinks and
bubbles. Similarly, the things you need to mold hollow can be
fantastical to cast. If therefore you happen to have a flaw, have at
your disposal a small leather  pouch full of fine sand, and having
placed it on the edge of a goldsmith 's bench, where one
files, place upon it your work, and secure it there with a rope which
passes underneath your foot. The sand in your pouch will respond to
the pressure of your foot , and will immediately be thicker on one
side and thinner on the other. Then immediately with a burin, outline
and quickly make the subtle parts of your cast which did not come out,
or which did not come out distinctly enough, or with a file or a chaple,
remove your metal  overflow. If there is a flaw in your materials
that has left a hole or something too hollow, scrape it with a burin and
make notches around that hole, then make an imprint of this with
wax . And place this imprint on a fine lead  blade, and in
this way mark the appropriate size of lead , or of any other alloy
which resembles your casting material the most. Then place this piece of
work on the notched part and attach it well with some with yellow
latten  or copper  wire - and if you are dealing with
tin  or lead  rub in some rosin  around the edge - and
apply all around it the replacement piece  some little thin
pieces of solder  or tin , or any other thing. Then with a
hot iron , or above the heat source of the forge, solder it
together, and then repair all of this with the aforesaid tools and the
appropriate chisels.


For gold  or a small work, you will need to attach them to a
lead  ball, which you will then place on the leather  pouch
and it will help secure the piece with the rope.

<div>Moulding the hollow part of a mold for seals or other
things
Firstly fashion your figure in wax  on an even slab of
glass  or slate . After, mold it with our aforesaid sand,
having beforehand lightly smeared with oil  as you know, and
having rubbed it with spirits , while tempering your sand with
hot water . Having made the hollow part, cast it in lead ,
using the same alloy as you do for other figures that come out very
neatly. However, if it does not release cleanly, repair it. And then
mold with wax  on the lead  relief & you will have a
very neat cavity in the wax  that comes out very neat in
lead . After, in your wax  hollow part, throw in your
tempered sand which will give you a relief, upon which you will cast
your hollow part with silver , or any other metal used for seals.
But note that you must not make your hollow part with melted wax ,
but only with wax  warmed in hot water , or even better in
hot urine . Or else, if you have a relief in gold  or
silver , or any other very neat and flawless metal, mold your
wax  hollow part directly upon it, and throw your sand in it
wax hollow , which will form your relief, upon which you will
cast your hollow part to make your seal or any other work. You could
also cast a hollow part directly from the main part of your metal, even
should you want to cast  in lead  or tin , which
will not make the main part of your metal melt, if it has been lightly
brushed with crushed chalk , or covered with candle soot ,
or with dried glair of egg .
When you have the wax  imprint of
your seal, mold in a noyau this piece of wax , which is hollow
like your seal, and your noyau will make a mold similar to the imprint
and the seal.
Your wax  must be mixed with a
color that has little body, so that you may better see your imprint. The
lamp black  or soot black  is good for this. White
wax  to do this is even better.
</div><div>Giving a medal the thickness that you wish
Having cast your first mold, mix some crocum  or well-ground
iron scales  to make it your mould  firmer. And having
taken hold, and made your hollow part very neat, take some paste made of
fine
 </div> 153v
<div> flour . And to flatten it, take a small stick of wood 
that is round and of an even thickness, which has at both ends a small
circle that sticks out from the rest, in order to give the necessary
thickness to your paste . And then with this rolling pin, flatten
it so that it becomes thin and tenuous. Then apply it on the hollow part
of your mold and press it down with cotton , and your figure will
impress itself on the paste, in relief on one side, and hollow on the
other. This done, with a brush that is dipped in melted butter ,
grease the part of the paste  that is hollow. Then trim off the
extra paste  which extends beyond the hollow of the mold. Also
oil  your mold with olive oil , as you have done with
others. Apply your clay  contour, and cast your second mold. And
you will have a medal as thin and hollow on one side as you wish. You
can have various rolling pins which some edges are more raised than
others, in order to make various thicknesses, or you can use sheets
lead  and copper  of various thicknesses, or
cardboard , all cut with the rolling pin.
 If you were to oil  your
paste , the paste  would absorb the oil  and it
the oil  would penetrate through the paste , right up to
the edge of the mold and attach to it. But butter  remains on the
surface of the paste , and does not penetrate it. For these back
bits, you must not temper your sand with hot water , because it
will melt the butter .  
</div><div>Testing the goodness and strength of a sand to be reheated
After it has set, it must be found smooth & easy to cut, and not
rough. It tests better in a large & fantastical mold, than in a
small one, for the large one remains long in the fire & the small
one is soon reheated.
</div><div>Making gold doux 
Sometimes, there is gold  so dry that neither cement 
nor antimony  can make it doux . Only verdigris  can
render it doux .
</div> 154r
<div>Removing gold 
Gold  as gilding goes away if the coin is reheated and placed
against a strong fire, even if there is lead , because
lead , which contains much mercury  will pierce a
gold  coin in a fire.
</div><div>Cutting lead 
Because it lead   is fat, hard to catch and corrosive to
the knife and the scissors, wet it up and you will be able to  cut
it like glass .

Sometimes, gold  and silver , exposed to a certain kind of
smoke, take on a coloration during the casting. But these are neither
flakes nor coat but a colour which will go away during the
whitening.
</div><div>Softening silver 
When goldsmiths  who work on a large scale have forged
their plates, to their loss these plates  quite often break and
crack because they have been sharpened too much. In order to avoid this,
when it is quite melted, throw in ground dry mortar  made of
sand  and good lime  which has been used before.
Goldsmiths  do not work with silver  from real 
because it is rich in lead  and becomes sour when forged.


For small works and things that need to go only once to the fire, some
weld with some old sol  or carolus  reheated and beaten.
However if the sol  is not quite good enough , the welding
will not hold as there is too much copper  and one will have to
weld twice. Others weld with an alloy made of  half silver 
and half fine copper .
</div><div>Iron  flakes
Once it is quite ground and refined on the marble  slab and
mixed with the sand  from the core mold , dry it slowing
without reheating it, and it will allow for several casting of
lead  and tin . Copper  and brass  come out fine
of it. But if it is not ground as finely as crocum , it sinks
unless the sand  is soaked and quite thick.
</div><div>Metal file dust 
It does not melt by itself if it is not helped with some portion of
similar metal  melted to assemble it and bathe it, as it is more
burnt than melted. File dust  from tin  and lead  are
made with tallow , file dust   from gold  with
saltpeter , file dust   from silver  with
sandever. 
</div> 154v
<div>Latten 
Latten  is very capricious to cast. It must be cast very hot.
And to rule over it better, throw on it some sal ammoniac  to thin
it. Alloy it as well with a little red copper , and when you want
to cast, a little tin  to make it runnier. It always leaves a tail
like melted glass . It does not require as long a gate as
others.
</div><div>Molding
It is only good that it die down a little on the outside, &
nevertheless be red on the inside, for when it comes out of the fire,
the air & strong exhalations of heat do not receive the cast so
well.
</div><div>The casting of silver 
Silver  needs a longish gate. For gold  it does not
matter. Silver , when soldering, tolerates the water  one
throws on it. But gold  would spatter, & needs that 
for that reason one casts solder   bran on the
solder .


Let the mold cool well after the casting, before opening it.
</div><div>Reinforcing flowers and delicate things
For flowers <corr>&</corr>delicate things  &
herbage, one does not use wheat oil  but melted butter , of
which one gives a light coat <corr># </corr> on the back
of the petals of the rose flower & the pansy & other flowers
that need it. But one reinforces the little legs of flies  &
other small animals with wheat oil  to strengthen them & make
them hold up.


with a small pinceau  
</div><div>Strawberries
The leaves are cast separately & then are joined with solder.
And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid, & by that means is
heavy, and the tin  stem which is delicate will not be able to
hold it up without soon breaking, one makes the stems with latten 
wire & then one solders & joins them.
</div> 155r
<div>Molding a rose
Because the little branches of the rose bush which are
aupart  around the flower are sometimes very spread out &
would make too large a mold, one makes <add>and molds</add> them
separately, and the rose & some buds separately. And then one joins
them with solder, the little branches & leaves of the rose bush to
the stem of the rose, on which one intentionally leaves the little tips
of the small branches. Put your leaf or rose as low as you can in the
mold because the sand  always raises it up. You en  can
also mold several petals together, once arranged one on top of the
other, separating them with threads, as is said. And regarding the rose,
you can give a thin layer of melted butter  on the back of the
petal, of <add>on the first petals on the outside, not those
on the inside</add>be , to fortify it & give it the
strength to withstand, <add>in order that the wet sand does not spread
out & expand more than it should.</add> You them  can also
mold well the leaves of rose bushes, strawberry plants, & similar
things, that are flat & can be flattened without spoiling them, with
two gates; to open your mold when it is reheated &clean the ashes
from it, All , and make vents & several gates. And this is
the easiest way, but the other can also be done. And with a wax 
sprue applied & joined from petal to petal, you can make casts. You
can even make a wax  sprue from <add>the back of</add> the first
petal until , which will join to the cast. All of this
facilitates the cast. Aulcu  The principal thing is to let
your reheated molds cool down well, rather than cleaning them &
blowing inside them to make the wax come out, because when the mold is
hot, the ash holds to it as if attached. But when it is cold, it wanders
and leaves with air or when one blows one's breath through the small
opening. 
 
You can give quite a little thickness at the ends of the stalks that
support the leaves, greasing them lightly underneath with melted
butter , because the leaves are large & weighty, and the stalk of
lead  & tin  would not have enough strength.

I would be of the opinion to mold the rose on its own with a little of
its stem close to its bud, & then to join it to a longer one of
tinned letton , because the bloomed rose has great volume &
weight.

Wet the rose with eau-de-vie  before putting it in the circle of
clay. Do not forget to oil the gate with wax . And when you will
have cast your wet sand , blow thoroughly, until it begins to take
hold. The rose came out well. But because the sand  is found mixed
among the petals, make your work soak in water for a long time in order
that shaking it in the water, the earth is gone from it.
</div> 155v
<div>Rose
Because the bloomed rose is wavy & has its petals disordered
& turned in various ways, it does not appear beautiful if it is not
painted, & also, equally, if it has weight on fir  such
that the stem of tin, which is brittle & delicate, is unable to
support it. One molds the flower of the rose on its own &separately,
making its gate large in order that it comes out b  better.
Then one cuts this gate down closest to the stem of the bud, on which
one grafts next & solders a stalk of letton wire to which one also
solders the leaves. But because tin , being thus thin, is
troublesome to solder, and any leaf can be melted. And also because the
cast flowers & especially the rose are not beautiful without being
painted, one does not take pains to solder, but one it  grafts
the pieces to join them & one glues them with fish glue  that
has been a little wettened & thickly melted. And in order that it
imprints better, one heats the tin  work lightly & at a
distance, for when cold, the glue  would not take. After your
flower is thus repaired, you follow the joints of the added parts with
esb modelling wax , which is a white wax  mixed
with much well-ground ceruse,  or even better, white lead ,
melting it & applying it on your work with a small hot point of
iron . In this way you can repair these little flashings that are
in the middle of the rose, or the holes of the  that may be in
any petal. Next you will paint your rose according to nature. If you
cast your rose in gold  or silver , you can join &
solder well. And in these same metals, when you have something delicate
to join to the flower, like a fly or something similar, fish glue 
is remarkable for it and holds very well, fixing it with a few small
points which serve as nails. The leaves & buds can be molded in two
molds that can be opened once reheated, but not before. Next these said
things are joined.
</div> 156r
<div>Molding promptly and reducing a hollow to a relief
You can imprint the relief of a medal in colored wax, & you will
have a hollow, in which you can cast en noyau  a relief of your
sand, on which you will make a hollow of lead or tin, in which you will
cast a wax relief. And then on that wax  you will make your hollow
noyau  mold, to cast in it the relief of gold  &
silver  or any other metal you like. But to hasten your work if
you are in a hurry, make the first imprint & hollow in bread
pith , prepared as you know, which will mold very neatly. And into
that, cast melted wax , which will give you a beautiful relief, on
which you will make your noyau .
</div><div>Very light and hollow work of gold 
Cast a lizard or any medal you like in base silver , like
billon . Next gild it lightly. And once the first gilding is done
& dried by fire, enliven, brush with a scratch-brush, & make
another layer of light gilding like the frst time, & do thus three
or four times or more, according to the thickness you want to give. And
then, having made a small hole in the least visible place, put your work
into good aqua fortis,  which penetrating to the silver 
through the hole will eat it all away without damaging the gold ,
so that you will have a lizard hollow unto its nails, or any other work,
so light that by blowing you will agitate it. But take heed not to apply
a thick layer of amalgamated gold  all at one stroke, or of hardly
any thickness each time, because that would block the small features;
but proceeding in it as said, lightly & in several times, and
cleaning well, you will do fine.

In order for the aqua fortis to eat away better, it is necessary to cast
in base silver.
</div><div>Chiseling
Lead  is so fat and soft that one cannot hammer it harshly,
one should have a light touch. Other big metals are easier to work with.
With a graver called an onglete, you make and retool the finest of
details. With the ordinary graver, you make the larger ones, and with
the chaple, you can remove the bits that have run, and with the … 
soften …  some lines you flatten or raise the lines.
</div> 156v
<div>Moulding a fly
Take the fattest flies, that go to pantries, which are not hairy, if
at all possible. If they are hairy, oil lightly their fur and their
unmanageable hairs with olive oil to make them lie flat. Take them also
and use them as quickly as you can after they have died, because it you
leave them to dry out, their legs will break when you want to stretch
them. You must also, to get a better cast, arrange them on some kind of
leaf or other similar thing. This will help to cast their little legs,
that are so fragile that unaided, they will not cast easily. They can be
arranged on a sage leaf or something similar. They cast well in gold or
silver but one usually the legs and wings separately and then join them
to the main body.  I have cast one on a bouquet of sage that had
seven or eight leaves. And to arrange it, I affixed the legs on the
largest leaf with a bit of melted wax and joined them with the pointed
tip of a hot iron wire. And to make sure that the wings will
eventually  join more easily to the body , I applied on the
underside some melted butter with a small brush. And with same pointed
end of a warm iron wire I applied wheatgerm oil on the legs and feet. To
tame and bed the downy hair that it has I also apply a bit of olive oil.

I do not let wheatgerm oil dry out a lot because it is very thick
and has body, and the spirits cannot penetrate it.
For applications, tallow is too harsh, pork fat is too soft, and but
is excellent because it is rather dry and curdles and instantly melts
and is firmer. Be advised that the legs and feet are well set on the
leaf, and not go beyond the leaf, because the whatever exceeds the leaf
will not cast as well, even if cast in silver, because these parts are
so fine that they will not cast. And truthfully, feet set on a leaf,
cast well, but those set from leaf to leaf which remain iffy did not
come out well in tin. The rest of the fly was cast, and likewise the
sage bouquet which cast very beautifully.

You could also cast them well in gold or silver without the feet, and
without attaching to a flower by casting it underneath the belly and
then joining the feet with soldering. And if you need to, cast the wings
in the same metal and it could be enameled if you fortify the wings and
feet as previously said.

If your sage leaf or your branch needs to be repaired, do as I have said
below. And then paint in a realistic way.

 

Having been cast in gold, one enamels the wings with window glass from
Lorraine, which is and transparent.

It is necessary to cast the fly from the ass with some melted wax,
fitted by an iron tip, as you know, to which the fly attaches itself,
and then the wax, as it melts, serves as a cast for the fly.

 + 

If it happens that you have some defects with your fly's wings, hammer
some very fine tin, or gold or silver, if you cast it, and shape with
scissors the amount you need for your wings. And then apply it with
tweezers and glue it with fish glue, applied like it is shown below. And
before doing thing this heat your work lightly so that its coldness does
not repel the glue, which will dry quickly, heating it from afar. Then
cover lightly the joints of whatever you've attached to the cast with
some esbaucher wax, which is a white wax that is mixed with a lot of
ceruse or white lead, melting it with a warm iron point. You will also
cut little bits of harpsicord string and will glue them with the
aforementioned glue when they are dry. It is to know, the feet, having
been reworked thusly, you will make them bigger with this same melted
wax so that they are equal in proportion with the rest .
</div> 157r
<div>A means of goldsmiths  for molding hollow


They mold their animal, or another solid work that they have already
made or rough-hewn in wax  and cast in lead , in two
cuttlefish bones. When it is good and impressed in the two cuttlefish
bones, they put a piece of paper  between the two bones & join
the bones and cast. The work comes in parts by halves. And then with a
chaple they excavate the two half castings of gold  or
silver  as subtly as they like, and then they solder or braze
them.
</div><div>Rouge cler 


Some goldsmiths  assay it on thinly beaten
esp   gold  & that is well burnished 
with a chaple  . But it is better to assay it on a
gold ingot . And also assay your substances in large or
fantastical work, since if they appear good & extraordinary in large
work, they will show excellently on a common work.
</div><div>Flies 
They mold better on a single leaf than on a bouquet or a flower or
the branch of an herb, since the single leaf is molded in two halves
that being reheated can be opened up and cleaned well, & the cast
will be better. In picking up the fly, take heed that you do not break
its legs or let it dry out too much, because then the legs will fall
off. And if this happens to you, glue the same legs back on with fish
glue  and wax , or adapt the hairs of a pig  or the
cords of a spinet . Fix the leaf on a flat piece of clay 
with two pins, and the fly with one pin in the middle of its body &
the feet with wax.
</div><div>Cleaning and degreasing your works cast fromtin  and
others
Make some lye passed through carefully with good ashes , and
it should be new & without any fat; boil your molded work in it. And
the tallow and fat will leave.
</div><div>Arranging an herb or flower to cast


Always put the front side of the thing on the upper side because it will
come out better and neater than the lower side. Make the casting large
& prepare the supraplus, which is the mass, after the
founders  of large castings, even for silver , which
needs a very hot mold & is cast very hot. Very fine thing must be
cast very hot.


When you know that the stem of a flower burned in a mold that will not
open at all is totally reduced to ashes, this is the sign that
everything else is well-burned.
</div> 157v
<div>Ash in the molds
One needs to let the mold cool before blowing to make the ashes go
out. For when the mold is hot, they adhere against it & once cold,
they separate from it more easily, & go out from it by blowing with
air en vapeur .
</div><div>Molding a bird 
One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
on a clay  slab, and hide & sink within it half the aforesaid
bird , <add>in order</add> that it only shows one leg & one
foot, then you will grease it with butter  to make it hold the
feathers down, finally ofoil  eau-de-vie . And
then cast. And having made this take, clean & uncover whatever needs
it. Next mold the other side in the same way. But because the feet,
being of bone that is difficult to burn, & are not able to be
cleaned with either by quicksilver If  or by any other
means, if the mold would not open, uncover the bottom of the feet &
the toe or the little finger of the claw, & mold as a separate
piece. Reheat & open your mold & clean the bones. The feet
usually remain too weak to support the mass of a solid bird .
And for this reason one applies an iron  thread in the mold of the
feet, which passes into the body before casting, thus they are
reinforced. Some mold the wings in a frame. Others mold the head
&the said wings separately en noyau , then join & repair
them, to first rough out a form that will be rigid & withstand the
wet sand.
They are skinned & fill up cotton
cloth . & even better, one needs to dress them in the way that
curriers  do, in order that they do not lose a feather, weight
it. The dressing is alum  & paste of flour .
</div><div>For making h…  wine f… rs ? 
Take a sock from the right d <add>t</add> foot that has
been worn and make it soak in water , and make that same person or
someone else drink the water  that comes out from it, and you will
see marvels.
</div> 158r
<div>Mercury  in the molds for cleaning


Heed well that your mold be quite cold before blowing to make the
ash  go out, and after put in the ☿  to achieve the
cleaning. For if the mold is hot, the ☿  penetrates inside &
flying seeks out conduits, & leaves an odor of itself, which sours
the tin  or other metal  that you will cast there so much
that it will break if touching the mold at all. The heat of the mold
also retains little grains of ☿  that make lumps & contracting
to the edge of the molded leaves, are joined there & make the leaves
frangible. The ☿  cleans the ash well, especially flat things
where there are not delicate tracks which could be broken by its weight.
And by thus, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, do not use
it. But if you have need of it, mix your crocum sand  so that it
withstands fire well. And after having put in the ☿ , evacuate it,
bouncing the end of the mold from below while moving it. Afterwards
reheat your mold gently so that the ☿  is gone from everywhere. In
this way I cast a branch of periwinkle leaves & flowers very neatly.
Having put a branch of melted   in the flower, on the back of the
flower  .


Reheat your mold until it is good and red before casting, so that the
☿  evaporates well.
</div> 158v
<div>Colors for green leaves
One usually paints them in oil , because distemper 
colors have no hold. For marigold flowers , lightly ground
minium  for some, & for others which are more yellowish, a bit of
massicot  with it. For green, the verdigris  has depth &
is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the
verdigris  a little yellow ochre  & stil de grain
yellow . If the green is dark, put with it charcoal of peach
tree  pits , which makes a v  greenish black, in the
same way that black of ox  foot bone  looks bluish. And
thus, by judgement & discretion, put the color on the natural
flower or leaf  to see whether it comes close. But layer it
transparently so as not to cover the lines of the work.
</div><div>Large molds
Because of the heaviness of the metal, it is necessary to put them
in a press so that they do not open.
</div><div>Candle smoke
It allows the piece to be taken out more easily, and even if it is
slightly thick, it does not stick because it has no substance. I have
perfumed my core molds this way for tin and lead, and I have casted in a
cold mold, but drying it well beforehand, and the piece came out quite
cleanly. It is true that lead mixed with half the quantity of tin,
because the medal was very thick, was very hot.
</div><div>Casts
If the medal is very thick, do not pour a cast that is as thick; the
cast just needs to be half as thick as the medal. But if it is thin,
make a cast that is of the same thickness. Do not forget to make vents
in the cast or the whole matter will fill with bubbles.


Never forget to oil the cast with wax when you cast herbs or flowers,
otherwise it will break and cannot be taken out.


</div> 159r
<div>

Portraits in Wax 


If you do not mix your wax  with any color dye , and if you
paint some colors on the wax , these colors would fade if you cast
it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly
with spirits diluted with hot water . If your representations are
varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to
remove this varnish  which sticks to the mold. When the
varnish  is removed, your mold is very clean. If your
representation is set on wood , it is necessary to pour very hot
melted wax  on the wood,  otherwise the mold sticks to the
wood . It is much better to mix your white wax  with
white lead  than ceruse , because white lead  is
whiter and more firm.
</div><div>

Chasing tool


If a chasing tool has passed through any part of the representation, it
is necessary to rework the whole thing and follow it all again.
Otherwise it would look like an additional piece.
</div><div>Fish  glue 


Beat it very finely & thinly on a well-cleaned anvil , &
next wet it with eau-de-vie  over ch  hot
ashes  & a low fire, & it will be quickly melted; & if it
is not strong & thick enough, add eau-de-vie . And take heed
them  not to put it in a fatty vessel , but in a new
one, if you can. It is melted on the fire &is also dried quickly on
the fire, but it may be warmed from a distance once on the work. It
holds strongly. One adjoins with it flowers & delicate things of
gold , of silver , of tin , & other materials
which are in danger of spoiling if soldered .
</div><div>Tin  and lead 


They must be beaten out very finely and tin  will not get brittle
or break, lead  is a bit fatter. But that is why it is necessary
to reheat it under hot ashes, and to beat several leaves together.
</div> 159v
<div>Cleaning files
Sometimes they are fattened & by means of the fat , the
lead , which is fatty in itself, or other filings , attach
to it. And you will be able to clean them either with hot
charcoal  or a wire brush made of wires of
latten.  
</div><div>Carnation
Mold a carnation like a rose, marigold, and all other flowers as
discussed, that is to say cast the flowers in one mold, and the leaves
in two parts in order to solder them onto the flower, this is the better
way. But you could mold the flower and the leaves together in one single
closed mold. I tried one which came out well from the mold. But the
sand  must be very thin, and you must blow very strongly.
 </div><div>Molds
Try to make one side as thick as the other, that way the two parts
will be equally reheated. You can open this kind of mold in order to
clean it, when you mold some animals, like crayfish, which burn. When
your mold is reheated, do not wait too long before casting again,
because it gets damp and loses its strength.
</div><div>Unmixed plaster 
If you reheat plaster  as a stone it would crumble into
water , but if you grind it before reheating it, it will not
crumble into water , on the contrary it will harden in water, if
it is good plaster like the one from Paris or from Spain which is as
hard as a stone, and which is found through poor and dry earths, and
which looks like white salt . German people use this
plaster  to make statues for their fountains, even if the statues
are varnished they will not be damaged with water . On the
contrary harden this plaster with water . When this sand  is
unmixed it sets much sooner. Oil very lightly your shapes of metal or of
other materials otherwise you will not be able to strip plaster 
from the mold. And dip your mold into hot water  in order to open
it, if it does not open in hot water , it could open into boiling
water .


It is sometimes even necessary to boil the mold in hot water , as
you would with wax  if you were afraid it would not strip
well.


Cold water draws oil out to the surface of the plaster that has sucked
it in and thus it strips.
</div> 160r
<div>Presses for large moulds
  It is made of two sheets of iron, fasten with four small iron
pillars, in such a way that the upper sheet is able to move and run
freely along the pillars, while the lower one is fixed. A St André
cross, made of iron, stops at the end of the pillars; there is a screw
in the middle of the cross, which squeezes the sheets against the molds
placed between them.

For small molds, we make a frame; having put the mold between two metal
sheets, we squeeze it in the frame with for small moulds, put the mould
between two iron sheets, and squeeze it with wedges.

Big wooden presses, with a screw, apart from being heavy to move to the
furnace for casting, make it difficult to see when they squeeze too
much, and they often break the molds.
The screw is fixed to these nuts which are nailed down the upper
plate, this way it raises and presses the mould.
</div><div>Sand  to cast flowers 
In casting with thick sand , flowers  crumple; it
squeezes them into a mass. For this reason, be sure to dilute your
sand  very thinly, and blow on it so the flowers  are not
entirely covered. When you dilute your sand , do not only stir it
with the small shovel, but beat it as you would egg white. 
</div> 160v
<div>Moulding a foot or a hand
Mix resin  to the wax . Once well blended, soften the
mixture in hot water  or urine . Then press the foot or
the hand  in the mixture in order to get an impress, then pour
plaster;  the cast will which will be clean and come off
easily.
</div><div>Fine work made of gold  or silver 
You can mold flies by hand,without casting; the wings and the feet
can be soldered, which you could not do with fine works of lead 
or tin , because they would melt. You can enamel the work made of
gold .
</div><div>Catching crayfishes
On the end of a stick, attach pieces of liver or lung, from beef or
mutton. Then hang a basket to the stick with a little string. Put the
basket into water where crayfishes eat; they will soon aggregate on the

</div><div>Catching passerines
If they sleep in the farmyard, like they commonly do, close to the
house, let the closest window open, and put a lighted candle close to
the window. The candle itself must be hidden, only its glimmer must be
seen through the room and through the window; all the passerines will
then lock themselves into the room. But the night must be very dark,
without any moonlight.
</div><div>Catching birds
During winter, when birds have molted, skin them and fill them with
cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your birds
on trees, have some look like they are  singing, look like they
have assembled  and are numerous.
the oven must not be too hot. This method  is good in the
summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they
birds  could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the
winter, because they dry by themselves.

<div>Preparing sand  for box molds
After your sand which is made  of gip de
lateribus  and alumen jameni  is moulded as a core, gather the
left-over pieces of your mould, and break them up on a long table with a
big metal block until they are very well crushed. And for an even better
result, sieve them neatly. Place them in the oven pots of
tile-makers,  in a bread oven, firing them  several
times, when it is well heated so that they become very red. When cooled
down, rebreak them if you need to and sieve them. After, put them in a
vaisse, a semal or a vessel that is appropriate and clean. And then wet
it with clear water.  And crush it and mix it with a big stick
until it is very well-moistened and rinsed, and the dirty parts rise to
the surface of the water. Keep stirring in this way the dulled
gip , that one prepares to gilt burnished gold  over five or
six days, until it is in no way lumpy. And each time your stir it, leave
it to rest and cull the clear water  that will be on the top by
tipping the pot, or with a porringer, or with a sponge. And put in some
new clean water  and in this way wash and stir until it is refined
and purged of all filth. Then leave to drain a little bit and to dry and
make of it some balls, soaked in sal ammoniac . Having been thus
dried, put them to be recooked in very high heat in a reverberatory
furnace for a good amount of time, where they will become very red.
Having been recooked in this way, crush them and try to mold something
in a box mold, having moistened your crushed powder with water of sal
ammoniac . And reheat and redden you box mold, and if your
sand  comes away, then you must crush it again and moisten it
again with water of sal ammoniac . Remold it in two balls and
recook it and redden it and continue this for as many times as necessary
until it does not come away from the box mold when the box mold is
reddened. The main thing is for it to be well recooked, because
otherwise the sal ammoniac  will not calcinate well and will make
the sand  coarse. And for this reason, you should not put in too
much sal ammoniac .
#  Note that before drying it, you must first wet the
whole thing and empty the liquid in another ordinary vessel, taking out
the litharge , so that the stones  and the earth 
remain at the bottom afterwards. You must leave it to rest and then
empty the water  by tipping it, and then leave it.

<div>Crocum ferri 
It can be made quickly if you put filings, well cleaned and washed
in an iron  drum to the height of two fingers, and cover it, and
redden in a reverberatory furnace, having washed it in good
vinegar  for a whole day. And it will be very well burnt and
clean, mixed and crushed on a marble  slab. Having been well
crushed and when well mixed, the vinegar  will corrode it easily
and will redden it quickly and bind it. Wet it with the strongest one
you can find and burn it after. And after three or four wettings and
burnings it will be ready. This one will be the color of columbine and
is considered firmer for casting than the one that is redder and more
beautiful in color, done with rusty filings and has more color in it.
Some burn the filings many times on a shovel of red iron ,
watering each time with vinegar .

<div>For the workshop 


It can be gathered from the words of Herodotus  that the
navigation of the Portuguese  was not newly invented by them as
they brag. At the beginning of the first book entitled Clio , he
says that the Phoenicians  would come from the Red Sea 
by continuous navigation to the coast of Greece , mainly to
Argos , to which they would carry merchandise from
Egypt  & from Assyria , which they usually sold out
of within 6 days .

Aes ustum


When it is finely ground it moulds very cleanly. It has a certain
fatness that makes it bind better than filings, & I believe that it
may not be ill suited for casting.

</div><div>Foot of bittern 
To mold it it is better to extend its fingers and nails on something
flat and let them dry this way for a few days, because in drying the
scales will be rougher and the nerves and and tendons will be more
apparent, and so the molded foot will be more artistic.
</div><div>Molds of things which have not been<lb/>


pelted
Animals who have not been skinned can only be molded in a double
mold, which can only be opened after they have been refired and after
the enclosed animal is completely burnt. Animals with bones or scales
which are not reducible to powder thus remain in calcined pieces which
will never removed from the cast, however much bellowing or whatever
amount of quicksilver is put in, or by using a feather pipe while
molding to make a gate. This is why you mold in two halves: so that once
the mold is opened after having been refired, the thing you've burnt can
be cleaned out. But I advise letting it cool so that in taking off the
clamps (being hot) nothing cracks while it is still fragile. While it is
hot the crust and cinders which it leaves and which stick to the mold
can be more easily removed when it is cold. Also note that on the side
of the lower mold when you reheat the animal, which in boiling leaves a
crust, in this case, always mark on the mold where the back of the
animal is so that in reheating it is to the top and above and will by
this method stay cleaner.

<div>Perfume maker 
They readily put half  of amber  & half 
of musk , & a very little civet , because amber 
always overtakes the principal scent  of musk .
To spare the amber , they readily put a little musk  in
the white layers & pour l   which gives a more
severe scent . But to remove la   or hide the
blackness of the musk , they put in a little of wheat 
starch from England  , which is perfectly white.
When the amber  To make a perfume of white
amber  in the fashion of those in Portugal , take a
huchau  of amber  well broken up. And having put in a
small silver  bowl  a silver  spoonful   of flower oil , or lacking that,
Ben  oil , that is to say, a silver 
spoon  that one uses at the table , put in your
ambergris  & place all on a low fire, and it will melt quickly
if your amber  is good, & it will remain there without lumps.
Once all melted, put in the amount of a pinon   of
civet , & make it melt & mix it well together. Next take
your gloves , well-cleaned & well-dried, & dipping the
tip of your finger   very lightly on  on the
edge of the oil , spread it on the glove  little by little
& with patience & rub the glove  between your
hands , & trace the fingers & the stitches, one after
the other. And leave it to dry. Next trace again as before until the
amber  is all laid down.
</div><div>Spirits 
Spirits  are excellent for making molds clean, in such a way
that where you do not apply some, common sand will attach to the figure.
But it needs to be passed three times. And because it does not take well
on oiled things, I believe it may be best to put some into the
water  with which you have moistened your sand.
</div> 163v
<div>Crayfish 
The hairy little horns that it the crayfish   has
under its snout tend to come out lumpy and unclear because, after they
are burnt, it is difficult to remove and clean away their ash, which,
staying in the mold, prevents the metal  from running well. And
for this reason, one makes a small gate of wax  thread at the tips
of them, in order both to hold them up and to blow away the cumbersome
ashes from inside.
Do not spare any pins, placing them not
only in the middle of the body, but also on the big legs, and two or
three on the tail, according to the positioning that you want to give
it.
</div><div>Crocum 
That which has become rusty by itself, having been doused with
water , salt , and either vinegar  or urine ,
and then well-dried and reddened by heating, is deep red when crushed on
porphyry  and is of the color of bol de levant , almost like
minium . But that which is doused with urine  and dried
acquires a deeper color and almost like crushed aes ustum  or like
vermillion . But the first one, finely crushed, acquires a bright
red color like cinnabar  when placed in spirits . And the
one and the other, when prepared as said above, finely ground and made
very hot, produce a red smoke like an acid vapor if, being thus hot and
fine, one throws vinegar , urine  or spirits  on top.
The urine  makes a lot of color and the spirits  as
well.
 </div><div>Repairing
It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a burin
called an onglet  or the one called chaple  or with a
small file. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr
or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While
reworking, moisten and rub your work with a small bristle 
brush.
</div> 164r
<div>Casting


When you make a cast of delicate animals, like snakes , start by
casting the belly side, or the under-tail, for this side has straighter
lines which are easier to rework than the back side, which is more
veined and is more marked.
</div><div>Repairing burrs


Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a chaple or a burin, then
scrape the burrs with the side of a burin, or carefully with a small
file, and rub with willow coals  and small brushes. Continue,
also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.
</div><div>Leaded silver 


A lot of silver   is wasted because of the lead 
which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in
small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the charcoal 
which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt
silver coins , like reals and others, and make them into ingots
prior to casting lizards  or animals , for it comes out
better. I cleanly molded a small, silver viper , like in
the first recipe above . And at the end of the line of 4
reals  (of 20 S of Spain ), and one coin  of 20 S
from France .
</div><div>Blowing


When you smelt silver  and gold  do not blow too hard or
with force, because the charcoal  will become spent and the
crucible will sink and, potentially, spill over. But when your mold is
ready, blow strongly in order to properly heat the silver  or
gold . When all are melted it is necessary to blow over the top
with a small bellows, doing the same for gold , for it removes and
reduces the smoke.
</div> 164v
<div>Molds


For molds wherein something must be burned (away), and do not open
before being reheated: do not cast before refiring/reheating. For large
molds that produce large and wide casts, it is necessary to score it
with strong notches so that the pitch  of the metal does not run
as forcefully. These will not make many burrs if they are pressed. Prior
to doing so, place between the mold and the press pieces of thick
felt for mittens , which will fill the cavities and protect the
mold from cracking. The clamps should be placed prior to heating or
drying.


When the ground from which you are making your earthen base to lay out
your animal  is too soft, the pins you place come out easily when
you cast the sand and so the mold is spoilt and the design is defeated.
Therefore when you know that your slab is too tender and soft, spread
some hot cinders over it and blow with the bellows.
</div><div>Sable


If you don't add enough alum de plume  or crocus your
mold  will easily crack when heated. But if your sand  is
mixed as it ought to be, the mold  will sustain itself. You'll
know it's of good quality when, while still hot after casting, it
immoderately soaks up the water  when dipped and breaks easily,
because the alum  and the crocus  render it spongy. To the
contrary, bad sand, which is composed of plaster  and brick 
and is not well mixed with alum , breaks easily in fire and
hardens in water . If possible, cast all at once.
</div><div>Molds


When you cast lead , your molds must be very dry, even if the
molds are large. The outside of the molds must be reddened, and it is
necessary to keep them in continuous heat until they do not smoke
anymore inside. Do not reheat your molds several times, but continue
when you have begun and do not let them cool in the cold because they
will crack. Let them cool near the fire. When your molds are still as
warm as above, remark, you can put your finger into the casting gate
without burning your skin. If your mold is large, it takes more time to
cure and to dry, and you must also cast warmer.
</div> 165r
<div>To repair

gray filling gum wax .

If it is crumpled & creased from being rolled up, moisten it

</div><div>Plaster  for molding
When it is long to set and dry, it means that it is too fat and
moist, which is what makes it shrink away from the fire and crack.
This is  where burrs come from. The one that comes from lean
earth  is better. You must not store your moulds made of fat
plaster  for a long time, because they resemble fat earth ,
which when drying, cracks. The best is to reheat them soon after they
have been made and cast. Moulds made of good plaster  can be
stored a long time.


It is necessary to oil it well, because it is more difficult to
separate the two halves of these moulds than when it is mixed.

</div><div>Repairing snakes  and lizards 
You could make some marks according to the form of their scales,
making some bigger ones and some smaller ones, according to the shape of
the neck, the body and the tail. If there is something broken, you can
attach it with small iron  or steel  nails, and glue it with
some mouth glue , then cover the whole thing with gray or black
wax . But it is necessary to let the glue  dry for one day
without touching it.
</div> 165v
<div>Positioning animals
Not only with iron pins, but also with melted wax, are animals
secured to the plate of earth. Wash them first in clear water, after
they have died in the mixture of vinegar and urine. And with a sponge
clean off their mouth, eyes and head of the froth coming out, because
the sand would never set well there and would become lumpy.

If you want to keep their mouths open, insert a little bit of
harpsichord string, which will not take up much space.
</div><div>Keeping animals
Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again,
put them back into the mixture of urine, vinegar and spirits where you
killed the others, and they will keep for a long time without decaying.
If you have a cut on your hand, take care that this mixture does not
touch it.
</div><div>Molds
After molding them do not keep them for long, but use them as soon
as you can, because when kept for a long time, they are prone to
spoiling.
When your molds are reheated, the thing comes out better.
</div><div>Lute
When reheating, you might as well use common lute, But when you want
to cast, strip it from the mold and, using a brush, quickly apply a
layer of plaster lute that has been used for molds, because it will be
dry as soon as it settles, and cast. This lute should be mainly placed
on the joints.
</div><div>Silver
When it quivers after melting, that is a sign that it is very hot.
And since it commonly contains much lead, it is good to throw in some
lime mortar because that attracts and gathers in the lead.
</div><div>Fly wings
So that they come out best, place wax sprues from the gate up to the
tips of the wings. Also make sure there is enough wax under the belly,
because that is what makes the cast succeed.
 </div><div>Attaching a fly wing or something similar
They can be attached with fish glue mixed with spirits over slow
heat, heating also the work. Then that is covered with wax à
ébaucher , that should be grey.

<div>Mortars
 Mortars are made of the best alloy of métal   and the
finest possible rosette   so that they do not burst, that
is to say one part métal   and two parts  fine
rosette  or old caudron, which is even better. Some of them are of
fifteen or seventeen lb. and are loaded with two and a half lb. of
grain powder , and they are put on common windows and doors.
Others are of a weight of 25 to 27 lb. and are loaded with eight lb. of
powder. And in such a way, they are made according to the stress they
have to resist. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the
inside, they are made like a crucible,   narrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards
the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of
powder they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of 4 s. lb. are
eight lignes  thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside
towards the opening, which is of 4 lignes . They have xiii
poulsses  long and seven in diameter at the mouth and
opening.
 </div> 167v
<div> 

The ones weighing about 27 lb. are ix pousses long and the mouth is 6
pousses  in diameter. At their bottom, they are 6 lignes thick,
and 3 for the mouth. The ones weighing 17 lb are 8 poulsses long and the
mouth is five poulsses . They are all covered together, all the
forks, rods, and tools which one uses, with a big canvas or big cloth so
that they do not make any noise. It is good that they sit loaded for a
while. After the powder  has been put in, it is grinded very hard
and then tightly pressed paper  is put in, then a cake of well
pressed wax  and, on the wax , another slab of cork 
that fits in very snugly and that you have to force in. In this way, the
powder  remains well packed and gives much greater force, and if
you wish, you can put on the cork  slab one of wood pierced in the
middle, if the mortar has a pierced bottom, which is believed to be the
easiest and which makes a greater hole because it cannot recoil. And for
these that have a pierced bottom, one must have a good gimlet to first
make the hole so that the rod, which is made by the point of the gimlet,
has before and without noise attached the mortar. And for these, one
must cover the button, which is quite sharply filed, with waxed
canvas , or add wax  to it so that it completely plugs the hole
in the bottom. But because the doors are sometimes iron and the iron
rods cannot pierce it, an iron fork made like pincers and another iron
stick made with three claws, like you see painted, are use. And in this
way, the mortar stays in place well and is immediately steadied. The
iron rods must come out of the mortar from every point made by the
gimlet, namely by three or 4 finger lengths, which all enter in the
door. When the mortars are placed, the touch-hole is filled with good
powder  and inserted in it is a feather shaft  filled with
tightly pressed powder  and moistened with vinegar , or if
needed, the powder is firmly pressed with the palms of the hands and,
having wet it with some saliva , you shape it like a cocoon
or
 </div> 168r
<div>  rod that we put into the touch-hole, and then, with a rope wrapped
around the end of a baston, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take
cover. The small mortars of 16 or 17 lb. are attached promptly with a
short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we
can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of 27 lb., but
then we only put three lb. of powder. The door really needs to be strong
so as not to be blown off for seventeenth lb. mortars. Some people use
little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others
load two canons of guns and, with a gimlet and a string, tie them with
the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not
explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.
A is a small rod, hooked like the hinge of a door and made as a
biron on one end in order to quickly attach a small mortar with handles
of fifteen or xvii lb. for a common door or window.
B is a small mortar with handles.
C is a common mortar of 27 or 30 lb. pierced at the bottom, where a
large iron  rod passes, button-like on one end made like a biron
on the tip so as to quickly hang the mortar against a door that will not
be covered with iron  plates.
D These are slabs of wax , cork  and wood  for
loading the mortar and well packing the powder.
E iron  fork made in the form of pincers as tall as a man,
used to quickly set the mortar without a rod. It must be of soft
iron  so that the sides fold easily, if needed, and to accommodate
the height or width of the door.
F is another iron  fork of the same height that supports the
fork made as pincers and also sustains the mortar, and with its low claw
prevents the pincers from recoiling.

main side, and the reverse is in paper  or cardboard .
</div><div>Reducing a round form into a hollow one
You must firstly mold it with plaster  as has been said
before, and in the plaster  throw in some wax  from which
will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at
your pleasure. Then you will mold this wax  relief once more in
plaster , or even better with your tempered sand,
# , as if for a noyau. And in the latter throw in some
lead  and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is
not, repair it on cement  or a similar material, and beware that
it should always release well. And this one will always serve you as a
model for making as many hollow molds as you would like. In this way,
place half of your lead  figure which you have oiled , and
moisten it with spirits  as we have seen above, on your
clay  base, then mold this half with a white plaster .
Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the plaster ,
take your black wax  mixed with sulphur  as we have seen
before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker. Dip it
in hot urine , and once it is softened enough, make an imprint
with it on your half figure in lead . And you will have a very
neat hollow mold. Then adapt your wax  hollow mold into a square
shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and
make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow
wax ; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and
even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in
wax  or metal  in a noyau. And the noyau mold will give you,
whether in silver  or any other metal you wish, a figure similar
to the wax  one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and
hollow on the other. And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it
in the bleach , if it is made of silver , you can put into
it some sugar  work
Having made a hole in your clay  base
and having placed there your half figure in wax , oil  it a
bit so that it comes out more easily.
Transparent wax  is not good as
opposed to one that has body, for making good imprints.
 Because you have molded one of your
halves with plaster  and wax , you can do the same thing to
the other half.

<div> perfume  and similar things. But be sure that the black wax with which you cast is hard, so it will come off rapidly when
dry so you can see if it has been stamped correctly. It can be made
harder by adding more melted sulphur  in the melted wax ,
and a bit of resin .
</div><div>Common medals
Relief awls are made of untempered steel , and then it is
tempered. With it we beat on a matrice, not red hot on the fire as some
people think, but on some steeled iron , reheated and adoulcy,
that is then tempered.
</div><div>Casting
Do not cast all at once because in doing so, the metal overflows and
gets cold instead of going to the bottom of the mold . Rather,
cast it bit by bit, and gently.
</div><div>Iron  clamps
When you put them for the second time, make sure that the mould does
not wobble.
</div><div>Molds
Those with noyau, when reheated, should be placed on half lit
charcoal , without being in contact with the air; like the frame
molds, they need to dry in the open, and uncovered.
</div><div>Thick tin  pieces
They should not be casted with lead  or red tin , like
thin and fragile things. It is enough if they are well melted and hot.
Fragile things need to be red hot and made of red tin .
</div><div>How to clean closed molds
You have to leave them cool down rather than blow inside to clean
them, because they hold the ashes when they are hot. Once cooled, they
are easier to clean. Have a fine brass  wire or a thin straw to
thoroughly clean the tail because it is through it that you cast. Blow
into it and siphon, bringing it to you. Give it volume before casting
the tail with wax , then cut it.

 
 

make a tail by soldering a latten  wire. The grains of a flower
are quite little, so they can be removed with the chaple, but the leafs
need to be peeled off correctly, then the paint will cover
everything.

<div>In the year fifteen hundred seventy-eight, the second of July, the
heirs of the late Sr. Ouvryer received (two hundred and five ecus), the
rent of Saint-Frajou, amounting to twelve hundred and thirty
livres.
They have also received, as part of the revenue of the year fifteen
hundred seventy nine, three hundred forty three and one third ecus.
And for the first year, they remain to be paid  eighty livres
and fifteen sous, | and for the second settlement, they have not yet
received anything.
</div><div>Against plague
Take, against pestilential fever or poison or plague, an
ecu 's weight  of your opiate  soaked in
scabious or bugloss  water , or thoroughly tempered
wine , if one is afflicted. After taking it, one needs to make
oneself sweat.
</div><div>For preserving
Vinegar  made from rue  juniper
berries   crushed together. With this vinegar burning
bricks  shall be extinguished. And the vapor shall be received
through the mouth  & nostrils . This is to preserve
oneself when one goes into corrupt air: a garment can be thus perfumed
& remove infection <add>from it</add>, from a room, house,
&c . If you find yourself in a place where you do not have this
preparation, carry rue   & berries  pestled  together, then, according to your need, boil them in
vinegar  and use as above.
