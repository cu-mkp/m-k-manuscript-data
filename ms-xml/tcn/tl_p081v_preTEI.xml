<ab>Only <m>brick</m>, very finely sifted, &amp; worn down one against
another, is good for all castings of <m>lead</m> and <m>copper</m>,
mixed with <m><bp>urine</bp></m>. This needs to be of that <m>whitish

<head>Making <m>copper</m> and <m>latten</m> run</head>

<ab>Put in at the end, when it is very hot &amp; when you want to cast,
<m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; <m>saltpeter</m>, which removes <m>filth</m>
&amp; heats it. Mix some <m><fr>ardides</fr></m> with the <m>latten</m>.
 Guard against the <m><fr>metal</fr></m><comment rid="c_016v_05"/> touching the <m>iron</m> or the
<m>latten</m> of the <tl>frame</tl>, but cover it with <m>sand</m> or
<m><tl>lute</tl></m>. Do the casting very evenly.</ab>

<head><m>Sand</m></head>

<ab><m>Calcined black pebbles from the <env>river</env></m> are good for
<m>lead</m>, but they dullen <m><fr>metal</fr></m>.</ab>

<ab>There is only <del><ill/></del> <m>clay earth with which one can
make <m>tiles</m></m>, reheated &amp; reddened &amp; passed through a
<tl>sleeve</tl> finely mixed with <m>glair</m>.</ab>

<head><tl>Frame</tl> casting</head>

<ab>It is good to make it with <m><pa>boxwood</pa></m>. Turn it in order
to make it even, as this is important for the casting. <m><tl>Lute</tl></m> also,
or cover the mouth of the <tl>frame</tl> with <m>sand</m> in order that the melted
<m><fr>metal</fr></m>, or <m>lead</m>,or <m>copper</m> does not touch the
<tl>frame</tl>’s <m>iron</m> or <m>latten</m>, because it makes it
brittle, &amp; makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always
higher than the <tl>mold</tl>. Also guard against the cast being too
wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
the weight of the substance that runs breaks &amp; shakes loose the
<tl>mold</tl> &amp; makes it porous. When you have cast, gently tap the
<tl>frame</tl>, in order that the substance spreads better. <m>Black lead of
<fr>saulmon</fr></m><comment rid="c_028v_04"/> from the first melting makes a very neat one.</ab>
