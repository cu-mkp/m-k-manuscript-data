<ab>One ought not to cast either <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> too hot in it, for
it would burn the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> &amp; come out lumpy. And <ms>to
know when it is at a good heat, dip a <tl>little piece of twisted
<m>paper</m></tl> into it. If it blackens it without lighting, it is at
a good heat. But if it burns it &amp; catches fire there, it is too
hot</ms>. <m>Gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> are able to be cast well
there, but it never comes out very neat. To mold something delicate
well, it is necessary that the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> be not so dry
<del>If</del>, for it is brittle &amp; does not release as neatly &amp;
crumbles &amp; flakes. However, before casting in them, dry them, &amp;
especially for <m>gold</m>, which does not want humidity. You will
recognize that they are dry enough when, after having brought the inside
&amp; the imprint of these to the fire, <sn>they cry &amp; crackle once
brought near the <tl><bp>ear</bp></tl></sn>. Then, join them &amp;
<m><tl>lute</tl></m> the joints with a little <m>clay</m>, &amp; make it dry
lightly by the fire, &amp; cast, &amp; then shake the <tl>mold</tl> or
scratch over rough scales, &amp; let it cool before opening. Usually one
cuts the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> in the middle, and the dullest part and
that which does not have any half circles

is the most delicate and smoothest for molding, &amp; thus one always
imprints there the principal;<comment rid="c_137r_03"/> the other is scaly on the inside, as it
demonstrates on the outside. Thus, one does not use this for delicate
things that are molded on two sides. One smooths &amp; flattens these
two halves on some <tl>smooth <m>wood</m></tl>, then one scrapes
<m>charcoal</m> on top to make it release well. And to make the
<m>charcoal</m> run evenly everywhere, one knocks on the side of the
<bp>hand</bp> that holds half of the <tl><m>bone</m></tl>. Once both
<m>charcoaled</m>, one takes the main <tl><m>bone</m></tl> that is
prepared &amp; rounded on the sides, and having set the medal on top,
one tightens and presses it quite strongly.</ab>
