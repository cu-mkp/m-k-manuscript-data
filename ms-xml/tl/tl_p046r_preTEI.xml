<head><md>For the <bp>teeth</bp></md>, <m>oil of sulfur</m></head>

<ab>Some people <md>whiten</md> them with confections of
<m>aquafortis</m>; however, one says that <md>this corrupts them
afterward &amp; causes a blackness on them</md>. One says that <m>oil of
sulfur</m> is excellent, but one needs to mix it in this way: take as
much <m><pa>clove</pa> oil</m> as can be held in a
<tl><ms><pa>walnut</pa> shell</ms></tl>, and as much <m>rose honey</m>,
&amp; seven or eight <ms>drops</ms> of <m>oil of sulfur</m>, &amp; mix
it well all together. And after having cleaned the <bp>teeth</bp> with a
<tl>small burin</tl>, touch them lightly with a <del>end</del> little
<m>cotton</m> dipped in the aforesaid <m>oils</m> and leave it there for a
little while, then spit or rinse your <bp>mouth</bp> with <m>tepid
water</m>, and reiterate two or three times. <m>Oil of sulfur</m>
<md>penetrates &amp; is corrosive</md>, <del>and <fr>l</fr></del> but the
<m><pa>clove</pa> oil</m> &amp; the <m>rose honey</m> correct it.
Therefore use it with discretion.</ab>
