<ab>one leg up to the other, in order that the spread out extremities
come to join one with the other through the means of the said gates,
which you will start in the round parts, empty of wax, that you have put
at the end of the feet to attract the metal. Thusly, the gate being made
by wax, you are in no danger of encrusting something from the molded
animal. And it is more expedient to make thusly the gate of wax, to cast
the second mold on top, than to wait to do them after the mold is
reheated<del>q</del>, for at that point, it is necessary, if possible,
that everything be ready. One needs to heat well &amp; even redden the
molds, where they are gates of wax, in order that it melts well &amp;
leaves nothing inside.</ab></div>

<head>Carcanets made <fr>à jour</fr></head>

<ab>They are molded like <al>crayfish</al> in <fr>noyau</fr>, first with
one side being raised up with <m>clay</m> which is hollow, &amp; then
one uncovers them from the other side &amp; one makes the second
casting. They are also able to be cast well in <tl>frames</tl>, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
<m>wax</m>, or else one fills the cavities that were not able to release
with <m>wax</m> or <m>clay</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Iron</m> filings</head>

<ab>Because usually <m>filings</m> are mixed with nastiness, it is good
to redden them in fire to burn the impurities, and then wash them in
clear <m>water</m>. In this way, the dirt will go to the top of the
<m>water</m>, that you throw out, &amp; the good filings will go to the
bottom.</ab></div>

<head>Carnations</head>

<ab>Because the ones that are cast are usually massive, <del>ou bi</del>
they are weighty &amp; for this reason, one makes them with leaves &amp;
blades of silver.</ab></div>
