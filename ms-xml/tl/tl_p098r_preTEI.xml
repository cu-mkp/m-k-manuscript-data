<ab>One needs to work the earth, then make it thinner with the
<tl>rake</tl>. And next, if it is dry, one needs to moisten it. Then,
stretch the <tl>cord</tl> very close, and hit on the entire
length of the <tl>cord</tl> <del><fr>as</fr></del> with the back
of a <tl>pruning knife</tl>, in order that the <tl>cord</tl>
marks a straight line, the <ms>length</ms> of which you will <del><fr>un
bord</fr></del> make holes with an <tl><m>iron</m> stake</tl> where you
will plant your <pa>rosemary</pa>. Behead &amp; cut to measure, and

<ab>To <m>tin</m> nails well, and other work, they <tl>file</tl> their
work very neatly. Then to clean it well &amp; rid it of grease, they
make it boil in <m>vinegar</m>, then they wipe it well with a
<tl><m><pa>linen</pa></m> cloth</tl>. Next, they heat it &amp; pass some
<m>rosin</m> over the top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
<m>varnish</m>. This done, they melt some <m>pure &amp; fine tin</m> in
their <tl><df><fr>estamiere</fr></df></tl>, which is a little square <m>iron</m>
box. And when the <m>tin</m> is well melted &amp; moderately warm, they
throw in <m>rosin</m> to burn the <m>filth</m>, &amp; then they let the
<tl>head of a nail</tl> or something similar soak a little, &amp; having
remained there for seven or eight <ms><tmp>pauses</tmp></ms>, they take
it out and shake it, hitting the top with an <tl><m>iron</m></tl> to
make the <m>tin</m> that is superfluous fall off, &amp; clean it with a
<tl>small stick wrapped in <m>tow</m></tl>. And if it is not well
<m>tinned</m>, you will rub it hot with a piece of <m>rosin</m> &amp; do
as before &amp; let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
which is a sign that the <m>tin</m> is the right temperature. But it
becomes blue if the <m>tin</m> is too hot. Things <del><fr>t</fr></del>
thus <m>tinned</m> are durable &amp; are not undone like <m>tinning done
in leaf</m>, thus at the end of a <tmp>year</tmp>, they can be clarified
&amp; renewed by heating &amp; rubbing them.</ab>

<ab><pro>Leadsmiths</pro> say that making a <al>lizard</al> die in the
melted <del><fr>il des</fr></del> <m>tin</m> makes the <m>tinning</m>
become very golden. Or else putting in <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</ab>
