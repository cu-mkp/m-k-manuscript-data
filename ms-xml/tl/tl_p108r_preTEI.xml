<ab>To hold the cores, some use <tl><m>wire of the same
metal</m> that they cast</tl> because it reduces <del>with</del> &amp;
melts with its counterpart, but because when melting or folding, the
core changes, some find it better to <del><fr>r</fr></del> use
<tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>, sharpened at the ends, because it holds
firmer &amp; having delicate ends, it appears as no more than a point of
a needle. And one can apply <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m> before using
it for a work. If it makes a hole, one covers it with a small

are not made on the side of the <tl>mold</tl>, which is thick, but at

mounds and <m>stones</m> formed in long scales &amp; long veins. It is
very soft, such that with a <tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl> one can scrape
it, &amp; makes a powder like our <m>chalk from <pl>Champagne</pl></m>.
And because everything which comes from the <env>earth</env> is mixed
with some other substance, to purify it, one grinds it, coming from the
