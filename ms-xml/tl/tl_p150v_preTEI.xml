<head>Molding hollow</head>

<ab>This <tl><m>iron wire</m> point</tl>, which is put thus
<del><fr>bi</fr></del> through the hole, is to better hold the 
core &amp; keep it from shifting. All of this being
<del><fr>d</fr></del><comment rid="c_112r_05"/> thus arranged, lay your <tl>mold</tl> on the
<tl>table</tl>, the hole at the top, as it is marked here on the side,
&amp; then adapt a <tl>circle of <m>soft clay</m></tl>
<del><fr>aultr</fr></del>, two <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> high, around
the hole, like for other <tl>molds</tl>. And then temper your <m>molding sand</m>
moderately thick, &amp; cast it through the hole until it is well <corr><del>well</del></corr>
filled, up to the surface of the <tl><m>clay</m> circle</tl>. But take
heed to not cast <del><fr>r</fr></del><comment rid="c_150v_04"/> in through the middle of the
hole, but rather from the side, for, since the already made
<tl>mold</tl> drinks and sucks the moisture <del>of the new</del>, the
new one that you cast in <del>which dries quickly</del> on the edge of
the <tl>mold</tl>, being quickly dry, <del><fr>s</fr></del> would
obstruct the <tl>mold</tl>, &amp; it would not finish filling. And when
you cast from the side, if you recognize that it is obstructed, you can
clear a path. Having cast in, blow on the <del><fr>f</fr></del>
<corr><del>the</del></corr> wet gate, &amp; put the
<tl><bp>end of your finger</bp></tl> in the hole a few times, <del><fr>po</fr></del>
or some <tl>small point</tl>, to unblock it, &amp; make the hollow
<m>wax</m> fill up. Cast in, at the end, the <m>sand</m>, tempered a little
thick to give strength to the <tl>mold</tl>, for <m>water</m> coming
to the surface <del><fr>s</fr></del> <add>of the <tl>mold</tl></add>
always makes it softer. Having set, scrape off the <tl><m>clay</m>
circle</tl> &amp; the excess which is on the hole through which you
cast the <fr>noyau</fr>, &amp; nothing will be discernable. When your
<tl>mold</tl> is thus prepared, <m><tl>lute</tl></m> it all around with the
same <m>sand which served for the <tl>molds</tl></m>. Next, reheat it in a slow
fire at the beginning, &amp; the mouth of the gate at the bottom, in
order that the <m>wax</m> flows out gently. For if you were
to give it great heat until the <m>wax</m> came out, it would boil
inside &amp; leave some pustules &amp; lumpy things, although</ab>

This <tl>point</tl> is placed in the middle &amp; through the hole of
the gate when the <tl>mold</tl> is in several pieces, like a
<al>turtle</al>, and this is done in order that the core does
not shake. But when the <tl>mold</tl> is only of two pieces, it is not necessary
to put <tl>points</tl> in the middle of it.<lb/>

Before casting the core, make some notches all around the hole
through which you want to cast, in order to always better secure the
<tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

Mixed <m>tallow</m> is the reason that, when emptying the <m>wax</m>,
the hole does not become obstructed. One needs <ms>half</ms>
<m>tallow</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms> <m>black wax</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

All very thick pieces come out better in hollow, because a thick mass of
mostly <m>lead</m> remains hot a <tmp>long time</tmp> &amp; eats the
<tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

You can, after the cast is done, mold <del>a</del> the part of the shell
of the belly where you have made the hole on the natural
one,<comment rid="c_150v_03"/> and reattach it with
<m>solder</m>.</ab>

<mark>X</mark><lb/> Note that, after your core is cast, it is
better to put the <tl>mold</tl> in <m>hot water</m> to open it, in order
to remove the most <m>wax</m> that you can, always softening
<del><fr>a</fr></del><comment rid="c_150v_05"/> it in <m>hot water</m>. For the less <m>wax</m>
that remains in it, the better, in order that, when reboiling in large quantity in
the <tl>mold</tl> when you reheat it, no pustules or lumps are made in
it. And then, if there is hardly any <m>wax</m>, you will not need to
reheat it as much. When opening the <tl>mold</tl>, the cast will break.
But it can easily be repaired, even though you
cast <mark>A</mark><comment rid="c_150v_02"/>
