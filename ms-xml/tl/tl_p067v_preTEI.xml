<ab>If they are not <fr>trempées à pacquet</fr>, that is, in the fashion
described, with <m>soot</m>, <m>salt</m>, &amp; <m>vinegar</m>, they
will not be good. The <del>square</del> large <tl>square files</tl> used
by <pro>locksmiths</pro> for their rough work are only made of
<m>soft iron</m>, but the <tl>soft files</tl> must be made of
<m>steel</m>. <pro>Founders</pro> whose work is to repair <m>latten</m>
&amp; <m>copper</m> must have their <tl>files</tl> <del><fr>d</fr></del>
coarse otherwise they would fill up with the <m>copper</m> which would
make them smooth &amp; soon render them useless. <m>Latten</m>, which is
more brittle, welcomes softer <tl>files</tl> than <m>copper</m>
does.</ab>

<ab>Once having been burned well twice &amp; pulverized, they mold very
neatly in <m>sand</m> &amp; need not be reheated, but simply heated with the
flame of <m>straw</m>. But if you mold them <fr>en noyau</fr>, give it
its first layer, simple &amp; very thin, with a
<tl>paintbrush</tl>, &amp; leave to dry at ease. Next, fortify the
following layers with <m>wadding</m> mixed with the said tempered
<m>sand of bone</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Essential oils</m></head>

<ab><m><add><pa>Walnut</pa></add> oil</m> mixed with as much of
<m>turpentine</m> &amp; distilled through an <tl>alembic</tl> renders an
essence whiter than <m>common water</m>. But this has no body &amp; does
not give bond to colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
the color without hold and fading. These, imbibing in this way,
would not give you leisure to work and soften any more than in <m>distemper</m>. But
you mend this defect by giving it a little body with
<m>turpentine</m>, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
work with <m><fr>azur d'esmail</fr></m> &amp; will make a perfect
<m>lead white</m>. <m>Turpentine varnish</m> made with this <m>oil</m>
is dry in one <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms>.</ab>
