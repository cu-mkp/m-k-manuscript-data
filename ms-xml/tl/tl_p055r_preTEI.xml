<ab>Warm the pipe<comment>c_055r_01</comment> well &amp; plug the touch-
hole below, &amp; take a piece of <m><al>pork</al>fat</m>, the freshest
that you can, as long as the <ms><bp>joint of your little
finger</bp></ms> &amp; of the caliber, &amp; put it in the pipe &amp;
move it up and down until it is completely melted. Next, load the pipe
at the top with a <tl>socket</tl> <comment>c_055r_02</comment> that is
held on the <tl>ramrod</tl>, as you know, &amp; it will only make a
<sn>little whistle</sn>.</ab></div>

<m>sap</m> &amp; <m><tl>pestled</tl> herb which is called
<pa><df><la>semperviva</la></df></pa></m> in the wound. It is the kind

<m><pa><la>vermicularis</la></pa></m>. And one takes for granted that it
will not die.</ab></div>

<ab>Take <tmp>in the <ms>month</ms> of June &amp; July</tmp>, a number
of the largest <al>snails</al> you can, with their shell, put them in a
<tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl> with a sufficient quantity of very hard
&amp; thoroughly boiled <m>egg yolks</m> with <m>good vinegar</m>.
Stopper the whole well &amp; put it under <m><al>horse</al>dung</m> for
the <ms><tmp>space of fifteen days</tmp></ms>. The <al>snails</al> will
first live on the <m>egg yolks</m>, then with the heat they will come
out of their shells &amp; eat &amp; live on those. Finally, a white
ointment is made with it. Without cutting open the <tl>bottle</tl>
<del>you put</del>, which above all for your safety you
<del><fr>b</fr></del> will always keep well stoppered, you will put it
<env>in the very strong sun &amp; in the <fr>serein</fr></env> for the
<ms><tmp>space <sup>of fifteen days</sup></tmp></ms>.</ab>
