take it out if you need to. And take heed that it is necessary that
these <tl>points</tl> be of the most delicate <m>iron wire</m> possible
which can support the size of the animal. For the more delicate it is, the
smaller the hole that it leaves appears. However, one needs 
different thicknesses of these, because <del><fr>il</fr></del><comment rid="c_128r_02"/>
<del><fr>de</fr></del> the <tl>points</tl> which are put in the body

stronger than the ones of the legs &amp; thin parts, where the
<tl>needles</tl> ought to be subtle &amp; delicate, almost like the
thickest <m>strings of <mu>spinets</mu></m>. And it is better that they
be of <m>iron wire</m>, which is firmer than <m>the one of latten</m>.
And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg, ought to be
joined to the body, do not put the <tl>point</tl> there, not to corrupt
it. But place <m>wax</m>, <ms>as much as a <m>grain of

as thick as two <ms><bp>thumbs</bp></ms>, in order that when you
cast in your <m>wetted sand</m>, you will see when it is thick enough. All of
this carefully arranged, moisten well everywhere with good <m>eau-de-vie</m>, with a <tl>paintbrush</tl>, the body of the animal

neatly &amp; without <del>porosity</del> any <df>small eyes or holes</df>
that one calls porosity, which usually come not at the back &amp; in the
thick sides of the <tl>mold</tl>, but on the edges. And as soon as you
have thus moistened everything with <m>eau-de-vie</m>, cast
in your <m>wetted sand</m> without letting the <m>eau-de-vie</m> dry,
which evaporates promptly. And wet it thus.</ab>

and make sure that the <tl>point</tl> is longish, depending on how much you want to elevate the head, and that it be pointed on both ends. Once placed
thus, plant your <al>snake</al> on the slab of <m>earth</m>, &amp;

If, after you have placed your animal on your <m>clay</m>
<po>cake</po>, you are distracted with other occupations, rub your
animal with <m>eau-de-vie</m>, &amp; under the belly, so that it
does not dry &amp; attach itself to the <m>earth</m>.
