<head>When the cast of <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> becomes porous</head>

<ab>

If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
<m>wax</m> which you can gild afterward with <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. To prevent this, if you cast thin, the alloy of one
<ms>℥</ms> <del><fr>d'est</fr></del> of <m>lead</m> for
one <ms>lb</ms> of <m>tin</m> is good. But if you cast with <m>lead</m>
<add>for a thick thing</add>, one needs for one <ms>lb</ms> of the
latter, two <ms>℥</ms> of <m>tin</m>, for the
<m>lead</m>, being fatty &amp; weighty, carries more. From this alloy, I
cast a <al>large lizard</al> like a natural one. In thick things,
<del>if</del> which keep their heat a <tmp>long time</tmp>, if there is little
<m>tin</m>, it makes it porous. Your <tl>mold</tl> must not be cold, but
<sn>of such a heat that you can handle it without harm, or that you can
keep your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> in the gate without burning yourself</sn>.
It is also necessary that your <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> be as if red.
Melt first the <m>lead</m> &amp; then the alloy of <m>tin</m> on top.
And as you want to cast, put a piece of <m>rosin</m> &amp; then a
little<m> looking-glass tin</m>. If you put too
much <m>lead</m> into the <m>tin</m>, it does not run very thin. And to know
<add>this</add>, if <del><fr>l</fr></del><comment rid="c_123v_01"/> the <m>tin</m> <sn>cries loudly</sn>,
it is a sign there is not too much <m>lead</m>. If it <sn>cries weakly</sn>, that
means that there is too much. Take heed</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

You can <m>solder</m> with the <del><fr>l'es</fr></del> same substance,
then repair it with the <tl>burin</tl>, <tl>file</tl>,
<tl><fr>chaple</fr></tl> &amp; suchlike.</ab>

<m>Tin</m> is a <m>metal</m> that penetrates, that becomes porous &amp;
burns, and is fanciful to use, more than <m>gold</m> and
<m>silver</m>.</ab>

<m>Lead</m> wants not only to be red, but also lively &amp; runny &amp;
