<ab>For shield grafting, one needs to take the new issue
that the tree that you want to graft has made <add><tmp>in that year</tmp></add>, &amp;
there cut a branch on which you see that next to
<del><fr>raci</fr></del> the sprouting of leaves there are little
buttons that one calls <df><fr>œillets</fr></df>, which are the beginnings of
sprouts. One needs to nimbly, with a <tl>very sharp penknife</tl>, cut
in the shape of a shield a little bit of the skin <del>with</del> which
contains an <fr>œillet</fr> or sprout with the leaf, thus marked B.<comment rid="c_105r_01"/>
<del>But</del> <del><fr>plusto</fr></del> Then, carefully make on the
tender wood, <del><fr>s</fr></del> which is in sap, on which you
want to graft, two lines thus <del><fr>de</fr></del> cut 
<figure size="x-small" id="fig_p105r_3" link="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yg3owXGn8wEALDW6I2jZxJzcQs2UURt6"></figure>, then
make in the middle a cleft thus <figure size="x-small" id="fig_p105r_2" link="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5T1FZYTdOT1U4Qzg"></figure>.
Next, separate, with the point of the <tl>penknife</tl>, the bark &amp;
open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your
shield so that nothing comes out but the sprout, bind it well &amp; wrap
it entirely with a <tl><m>slip of <pa>linen</pa></m></tl> or <tl><m>very
soft thread</m></tl>, so that there is nothing uncovered but the leaf,
which in three or 4 <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> will give you an indication
whether the shield should take, accordingly it will be green. Leave your
graft seven or eight <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> thus, then unbind it &amp;
join it well to the bark, especially at the sprout, &amp; then rebind
all gently but not as strongly as before; &amp; if there is any output
or growth, leave it space to go out, &amp; do thus three or 4
times.</ab>
