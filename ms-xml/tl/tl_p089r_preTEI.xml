<head><m>Sand of burnt <al>ox</al> bones and rock salt</m></head>

<ab>I have pulverized them separately &amp; finely ground them on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, as much as I could. Then I mixed <ms>as much
of one as the other</ms> &amp; reworked them on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Next, I moistened it in <tl><m>paper</m></tl>,
folded in a wet <tl>napkin</tl>, which is previously made in the
<tmp><env><fr>serain</fr> of the night</env></tmp> or in the
<env>moisture of the cellar</env>. And I have not found anything else
which releases more neatly than this one. It wants to be rather humid.
And if you want to cast very thin, make sure it is very hot. It came out
very neatly in <m>soft tin</m>, like the principal,<comment rid="c_137r_03"/> and withstood
several casts. For <m>tin</m>, I believe that it is not necessary to
seek a better one, nor for <m>fine lead</m> either, which comes out almost
as neatly as <m>tin</m>. <del><fr>Tou</fr></del> The <m>bone of the foot
of <al>oxen</al></m> is always so lean on its own that, without being
mixed with one or two parts of some <m>fatty sand</m> &amp; one that has bond,
such as <m>tripoli</m>, <m>salts</m>, <m>felt</m>, <m>ashes</m> &amp;
similar things, it would not release &amp; would not mold neatly, for it
crumbles.</ab>
