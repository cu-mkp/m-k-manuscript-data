<ab>When you are making a painting with several persons, just as the

<m><fr>Azur d’esmail</fr></m> hates more than any other to be ground,
especially with <m>water</m>, for it dies &amp; loses all its color.
However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with
<m>water</m> but with <m>oil</m> &amp; grind it thickly, and in this
way it will not die as much.</ab>

<ab>When the color has dried inside, &amp; you want to clean them, soak
them in <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> and they immediately will
turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>. <m><pa>Walnut</pa> oil</m> is not <del>as
not</del> as appropriate to soften them as that of <m><pa>spike
lavender</pa></m>, which is clear like <m>water</m> &amp; penetrates
&amp; does not have body like <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>. The <tl>handle
of paintbrushes</tl> is made by those who work with
care from <m><al>porcupine</al> quills</m>,
by others from <m><m>wood</m> of arrows from <pl>Turkey</pl></m>
<del>with whom</del> with which they also make <tl>small rods to rest
their <bp>hand</bp> when they are painting</tl>.</ab>

To work well on a small scale <tl>very thin paintbrushes which
have a firm point</tl> are<del><fr>on</fr></del><comment rid="c_058v_04"/> needed. And because a 
<m><al>squirrel</al>’s tail hair</m> is soft,
the most careful take the <m>bristles of the oldest <al>rats</al></m>,
especially of <al>dormice</al> if they can find them, &amp; put two or
three of them in the middle of the <tl>paintbrush</tl>. These make
a straight line like a <tl><m>quill</m></tl> &amp; all the other
<m>hairs</m> of the <tl>paintbrush</tl> stick to them as to the
point. The <m>bristles of <al>beech martens</al> &amp; <al>weasels</al>
&amp; small animals that make <m>musk</m></m> are even better, for a
single <m>hair</m> in a <tl>paintbrush</tl> suffices.</ab>
