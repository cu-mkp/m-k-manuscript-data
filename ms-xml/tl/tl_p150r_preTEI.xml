<ab>For hollow things like <al>turtles</al>, <ms>half</ms> <m>fine
lead</m> and <ms>half</ms> <m>tin</m>.</ab>

<ab>For flowers, almost all <m>tin</m>, namely a <ms>lb</ms> of <m>fine
tin</m> and two <ms>℥</ms> of <m>fine lead</m>.</ab>

<ab>For <al>lizards</al> that are as thick as one or two
<ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms>, almost all <m>lead</m>, namely a <ms>lb</ms>
of <m>fine lead</m> and 4 <ms>℥</ms>

<head><tl>Molds</tl></head>

<ab>They are less subject to cracking while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than when they are of a little thickness, provided that
the thickness is sufficient. For when thin, they scarcely need to be
<del><fr>recui</fr></del> on the fire, &amp; a long time on the fire
makes them corrupt, especially when the <m>plaster</m> is not
strong.</ab>

<ab>It is better to reheat a <tl>mold</tl> on its own than several
together, because one needs a larger &amp; more violent fire for several
than for one. And, <m>glowing charcoal</m> stopping up the space between
the <tl>molds</tl>, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such
a way that more often you will find your <tl>molds</tl> burst &amp;
cracked on one side more than another.</ab>

<ab>Therefore reheat your <tl>molds</tl> alone, not making fire there,
except to cover it.</ab>

<ab>And because your <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> become sour when
frequently melted red, to soften it melt it without reddening it and
cast in a rod.</ab>

<ab><m>Brick</m> cools the <m>metal</m>, &amp; if this was for giving a
bond, it will not be necessary.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>

The reheated <tl>molds</tl> cannot withstand several casts. But those in
which one wants to cast only <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>
<corr><del>and</del></corr> <add>or</add> flat medals, having been only
dried, withstand many.</ab>

<m>Very finely ground iron scales</m> render them very firm &amp;
strong.</ab></div>.
