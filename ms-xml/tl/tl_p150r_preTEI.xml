<ab>They are less subject to cracking while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than when they are of little thickness, provided that
the thickness is sufficient. For being thin, they scarcely need to be

makes them corrupt, especially when the <m>plaster</m> is not
strong.</ab>

<ab>It is better to reheat a <tl>mold</tl> on its own than several
together, because one needs a larger &amp; more violent fire for several
than for one. And, <m>glowing charcoal</m> stopping up the space between
the <tl>molds</tl>, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such
a way that more often you will find your <tl>molds</tl> burst &amp;
cracked on one side more than another.</ab>

<ab>Therefore reheat your <tl>molds</tl> alone, not making fire there,
except to cover it.</ab>

<ab>And because your <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> become sour when
