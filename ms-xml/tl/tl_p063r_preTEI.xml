<ab>Although it is said to be immortal, it is nonetheless the case that

<head>Casting</head>

<ab>The <pl>Germans</pl> use <m>lead from <pl>Flanders</pl></m> because
it is very soft. And to cast better they take <m>lead ore</m> &amp; melt
it, &amp; separate what is melted from the <m>filth</m> &amp;
<m>ore</m>, &amp; pour it into a separate <tl>vessel</tl>, then <del>the
bottom</del> they make their cast with it. For the <m>lead</m> must not have been
put to work before, but rather completely new. Some cast into <tl>molds
of <m>iron</m> &amp; <m>copper</m></tl>.</ab>

or new <m>lead</m> coming from the <env>mine</env>. They melt it twice
in a <tl>crucible</tl>. In the first one, they purge it of

<head><m>Verdigris</m> and another very beautiful bright green</head>

<ab>One ought not to grind it with <m>water</m> alone, for that makes it
die. To render it beautiful in <m>distemper</m>, some grind it with
<m>vinegar</m>, but that makes it turn pale &amp; become whitish. To
render it beautiful, grind it with <m><bp>urine</bp></m> &amp; leave to dry.
Then, whenever you like, grind it with <m>oil</m>. And after you have
collected it with the <tl>spatula</tl>, before finishing to clean the
<tl><m>marble</m></tl>, grind <m>stil de grain yellow</m> on it. And you
will have a very beautiful green.</ab>
