<head><m>Sand  for <m>lead</m></m></head>

<ab><la>℞</la> <m>grey soot from the furnace of the
<pro>silversmiths</pro></m>, <m>quick lime</m>, and
flour, <ms><la>ana</la></ms>,<comment>c_083r_03</comment> moistened according to the art, being the
finest possible.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-top</margin>
The <m>grey soot of <pro>locksmiths</pro></m>, which is held in the
<tl>forge</tl>, is very fine once ground, molds very neatly, &amp;
releases very well.</ab>

<head>Sand for <m>copper</m> medals</head>

<ab><la>℞</la> <m>hat felt burnt</m> <add>on a covered
fire</add>, <m>dross of iron</m>, &amp; <m>burnt bone</m>, all of which
ground very finely &amp; <tl>pestled</tl> &amp; watered with <m>saltwater</m>;
&amp; make a paste of it &amp; mold it, &amp; wipe it over a
<m>straw</m> fire. <add>  These three <m>sands</m>, pulverized and very finely
ground on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, mold well, and I think that
separately each of them is very good. <m>Burnt hat felt</m> molds very
neatly and releases very neatly.</add></ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-top</margin>
<m>Plaster</m> molds very neatly but it becomes porous. <m>Bone</m> has
scarcely any body unless it has <m>iron dross</m>. <m>Felt</m> makes it
release. </ab>

<head>Another <m>sand</m></head>

<ab> <m>Charcoal of <pa>vine</pa> shoots</m> &amp; <m>clay earth</m>,
<del>well cooked &amp;</del> <add>well</add>
<tl>sieved</tl>, as much of one as the other, &amp; join them together
with <m>well beaten glair of eggs</m>, then calcine in the
<tl>furnace</tl>, &amp; to use it, temper it with <m>vinegar</m>.</ab>

<div>
<id>p083r_4</id>
<head>Another for <m>lead</m></head>

<ab><la>℞</la> <m>finely <tl>pestled</tl> slate</m> &amp;
<m><del>calcined</del> pumice stone</m>, mixed together. Calcine them in
a well covered <tl>pot</tl>, &amp; thrice stoppered over a good fire,
&amp; each time temper them with <m>varnish</m>.</ab>

<head>Another</head>

<ab><la>℞</la> <del><fr>p</fr></del> a <m> little-cooked tile,
ground</m> &amp; tempered in <m>white wine</m> with <m>burnt black
tracing paper</m>, &amp; if you add <m>burnt <al>horse</al>
dung</m>, it will be all the better. Moisten with <m>glair of egg</m>.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
<m>Tracing paper burnt</m> over a closed fire is reduced just as
<m>charcoal</m> &amp; very soft black, molds neatly &amp; makes it
release well mixed with the others.</ab>

<id>p083r_6</id>
<head>Excellent sand</head>

<ab><m>Alabaster calcined</m> in a <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> over
<m>charcoal</m> fire, so that, touching it, it turns into powder. Once
cold, pulverise it finely &amp; pass it through a <tl>double sieve</tl>
&amp; render it as if impalpable. And <del><fr>d</fr></del> with one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>alabaster</m>, one needs one
<ms>℥</ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>. Mix well &amp;
incorporate everything together, then put them in a
<del><env>cellar</env></del> <env>cellar</env> or a <env>damp
place</env>. And with this paste, mold what you will need, &amp; next
dry the <tl>mold</tl> in the fire, &amp; cast whatever you wish, while
the <m>sand</m> is hot; &amp; you will cast as neatly as the principal,<comment>c_137r_03</comment> &amp;
the <m>sand</m> can still be used by placing it in a <env>damp place</env>
&amp; drying it in the fire.</ab>
