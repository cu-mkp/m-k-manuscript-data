<ab>and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your
<tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> and easily <tl>pestle</tl> in a <tl>mortar of <m><fr>metal</fr></m>,<comment rid="c_016v_05"/> 
or better yet, of <m>iron</m></tl>. Next, it
will be easy to grind it, not <del>only</del> on <m>common
<tl>marble</tl></m> <add>that would corrode</add>, but on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, and it is necessary that it be finely ground
<add>with <m>water</m></add> so that when putting it on your
<tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl>, you find it soft without any asperity, like
the colors that the <pro>painters</pro> grind for <m>oil</m>. This one, once dry, you can
use <del><fr>au lii</fr></del> instead of <m>sand</m>, in a <tl>frame</tl> 
without moistening it with anything nor reheating it, if you do
not want to; fumigate the hollow form with <m>sulfur smoke</m> or <del><fr>de
p</fr></del> with the tip of the flame of a <tl><m>wax candle</m></tl>
that barely makes <m>smoke</m>, and it will make a very neat &amp; shiny &amp;
polished work, in <m><add>pure</add> lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>. I would
say the same for <m>finely pulverized tripoli</m> that does not want to
be <del>not</del> reheated or moistened. <m>Burnt linen</m> gives less
trouble than any other, because it needs neither to be reheated nor to be
moistened, &amp; molds <add>and releases</add> very neatly <del>&amp;
very</del>, subtly &amp; <del>releases well</del> neatly, like the
previous ones do as well, &amp; withstands several fusions. First one ought to burn
it with a flame, then leave it to rest &amp; to be consumed with its
fire until it wears it out, then finely grind it on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl> or on a <tl><m>paper</m></tl>. <del>But because a

lot</del> And if you reheat it in a <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, red hot due to
the fire, to render all of it fine &amp; impalpable, I believe it will
be even better. But because a lot of <m>linen</m> is reduced to very
little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
medal that you want to mold &amp; cover it, and fill the <tl>frame</tl> with <m><tl>pestled</tl> slate</m>, which molds also very neatly. But
note that the first cast is always the most beautiful &amp; the neatest.
If you cast opportunely, <m>soft tin</m> that seems to be
burnished in little wheels that <pro>pewterers</pro> sell, comes out
very neatly &amp; approaching the color of <m>silver</m>, without mixing
in anything. It is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &amp;
so that the molded object should be 4 <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> away
from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well, <add>so
hot</add> <del>with such a <ms>degree of heat</ms></del> that it
promptly burns in a shiver a <tl><m>paper</m></tl> or <tl><m>straw</m></tl> placed
inside. Then remove it from the fire &amp; leave it to
rest a little &amp; cast. <m>Tin</m> mixed
