<head>For knowing the good <m><fr>cendrée</fr><comment rid="c_013v_04"/> of azure</m> for <m>oil</m></head>

<ab>The one that accumulates in small clods and is lumpy is
the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is very
pale in color, because <m>oil</m> darkens it. Certain
<pro>sophisticators</pro> mix them, but you will know this if you pour
some onto a piece of <m>paper</m> &amp; press it &amp; spread it with
the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> since, if it is mixed, it will be found
variegated &amp; as if striped with a pale one &amp; a darker one, but if it is
unmixed it will be even &amp; of one color.
