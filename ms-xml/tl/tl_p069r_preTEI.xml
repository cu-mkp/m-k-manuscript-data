<ab>You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way so lean
&amp; arid that it does not have bond, like <m>the one from the
<env>sea</env></m> or <del><fr>desei</fr></del> <m>from <env>sandy
paths</env> dried out by the <env>sun</env></m>. But <add>choose</add>
them <del>or in <fr>t</fr></del> in the first place from
<env>quar<del><fr>reries</fr></del>ries</env> or <env>rock caves</env>,
because that one is best, provided that it is very fine. You will recognize the
vein of it if, among the greyish <env>rocks</env> or <env>quarries</env>
<del><fr>qu</fr></del> that seem to be made of <m><fr>arene</fr></m>,
you see, <tmp><env>after rainy weather</env></tmp>, certain small
patches like dust attached to the said <env>rocks</env>, or if due to the
humidity, a small piece of it flakes off, which easily crushed between your 
<tl><bp>hands</bp></tl>. You will also find in <m>lean soils</m> some which comes
off in <del><fr>lop</fr></del> large lumps like <m>stones of
<fr>tuf</fr></m> <del><fr>et ne</fr></del>, or among <m><fr>terres
<pl>bolvenes</pl></fr></m>, which are much better than those in
<m>fatty &amp; strong earths</m>. And one ought not to take it from the
surface, for fear that it be mixed with <m>common earth</m>, but three
or 4 <ms><bp>feet</bp></ms> below &amp; the closest to the
<m><fr>tuf</fr></m> or <m>stone</m>. Since it comes out in large lumps
one would say that it starts to form in stone. But when it is wet, it
comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it
is quite granular, &amp; that when cushed between the
<tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl>, it renders itself into very great subtlety, <del>like 
impalpable</del>, keeping nevertheless its sandy asperity, without <m>muddying</m> the
<tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> like <m>clay</m>. It is dried slightly on the
<del><ill/></del>fire,<comment rid="c_069r_05"/> then it is <tl>pestled</tl> &amp; passed finely through a <tl>double
sieve</tl> or a <tl><m>linen</m> sleeve</tl>, then is moistened with

The <pl>Toulouse</pl> <pro>molder</pro> reheats it strongly then grinds
