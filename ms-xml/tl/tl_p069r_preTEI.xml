<ab>You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way so lean
&amp; arid that it does not have bond, like <m>the one from the
<env>sea</env></m> or <del><fr>desei</fr></del> <m>from <env>sandy
paths</env> dried out by the <env>sun</env></m>. But <add>choose</add>
them <del>or in <fr>t</fr></del> in the first place from
<env>quar<del><fr>reries</fr></del>ries</env> or <env>rock caves</env>,
because that one is best, provided that it is very fine. You will recognize the
vein of it if, among the greyish <env>rocks</env> or <env>quarries</env>
<del><fr>qu</fr></del> that seem to be made of <m><fr>arene</fr></m>,
you see, <tmp><env>after rainy weather</env></tmp>, certain small
patches like dust attached to the said <env>rocks</env>, or if due to the
humidity, a small piece of it flakes off, which easily crushes between your 
<tl><bp>hands</bp></tl>. You will also find in <m>lean soils</m> some which comes
off in <del><fr>lop</fr></del> large lumps like <m>stones of
<fr>tuf</fr></m> <del><fr>et ne</fr></del>, or among <m><fr>terres
<pl>bolvenes</pl></fr></m>, which are much better than those in
<m>fatty &amp; strong earths</m>. And one ought not to take it from the
surface, for fear that it be mixed with <m>common earth</m>, but three
or 4 <ms><bp>feet</bp></ms> below &amp; the closest to the
<m><fr>tuf</fr></m> or <m>stone</m>. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say that it starts to take shape as a stone. But when it is wet, it
comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is quite granular, &amp; that when crushed between the
<tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl>, it renders itself into very great subtlety, <del>like 
impalpable</del>, keeping nevertheless its sandy asperity, without <m>muddying</m> the
<tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> like <m>clay</m>. It is dried slightly on the
<del><ill/></del> fire,<comment rid="c_069r_05"/> then it is <tl>pestled</tl> &amp; passed finely through a <tl>double
