<ab>Only <m>brick</m>, very finely sifted, &amp; worn down one against

<ab>Put in at the end, when it is very hot &amp; when you want to cast,
<m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; <m>saltpeter</m>, which removes <m>filth</m>

<head><tl>Frame</tl> casting</head>

<ab>It is good to make it with <m><pa>boxwood</pa></m>. Turn it in order
to make it even, as this is important for the casting. <m><tl>Lute</tl></m> also,
or cover the mouth of the <tl>frame</tl> with <m>sand</m> in order that the melted
<m><fr>metal</fr></m>, or <m>lead</m>, or <m>copper</m> does not touch the
<tl>frame</tl>'s <m>iron</m> or <m>latten</m>, because it makes it
brittle, &amp; makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always
higher than the <tl>mold</tl>. Also guard against the cast being too
wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
the weight of the substance that runs breaks &amp; shakes loose the
<tl>mold</tl> &amp; makes it porous. When you have cast, gently tap the
<tl>frame</tl>, in order that the substance spreads better. <m>Black lead of
