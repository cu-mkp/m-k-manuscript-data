avoid putting <tl>points</tl>, which should not be put except at the
raising of the head, at the thickest places of the body &amp; the simple
&amp; delicate parts in the middle of the <al>lizard</al>’s feet, the
nails of which you will enter into the <tl><m>clay</m> slab</tl>, in
order that they remain secure. When you have made the first cast &amp;
uncovered the belly of the animal, do not forget to put small thin
<del><fr>s</fr></del><comment rid="c_133r_01"/> <tl>slabs of <m>wax</m></tl> at the end of the
<al>lizard</al>’s legs. But, if it is a <al>small wall lizard</al>,
lightly cover with <m>wax</m> the entire bottom of the foot,
<del>and</del> and <del>this</del> the <m>wax</m>, being removed after
the second cast, leaves a cavity which fills these small fingers with
<m>metal</m>, &amp; then one repairs them. Take heed therefore to attach
well with <m>wax</m> the parts of the animal which pass one over the
other, in order that the <m>wetted sand</m> entering between two does not take it
away. <del>And if</del> For if this were to happen, the <del><tl>mold</tl>
would spoil</del> shape <del>in the first place</del> would
<del>spoil</del> corrupt &amp; your <tl>mold</tl> also because it would
not have the thickness that <del><fr>il</fr></del><comment rid="c_128r_02"/> you think &amp; would be
pierced &amp; spoiled. And, even though to avoid this you can make the
<tl>mold</tl> thicker, however, should <del><fr>l</fr></del><comment rid="c_123v_01"/> this mishap
happen, you will be able to repair it in this way.</ab>

<head>For mending a pierced <tl>mold</tl></head>

<ab>

If the molded animal comes away in some place <del>to not have</del> and
deviates from the stance that you gave it, because it was not quite dead
or because it was not well attached with the <tl><m>iron</m> points</tl>
or with <m>melted wax</m>, and it does not have the thickness that it
needs on the outside, at the middle of the swelling, or is pierced,
before removing the animal from inside, uncover what seems to you the
weak part, or the place that is pierced, and make small holes
all around <corr><del>all around</del></corr>, then soak the back of the
<tl>mold</tl>. And cast promptly on top of the <add>same</add> <m>tempered sand</m>,
which will enter in these openings &amp; mold &amp; attach to the other.
But, one will need to <m><tl>lute</tl></m> this place well afterward. </ab>

<ab>

One can use the mixture of <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m> in
<tl>molds</tl> for <m>silver</m> as well as for <m>gold</m>, for it
firms them &amp; keeps them from cracking &amp; making flashing. And I
believe that for flat things it would withstand <del>well
<fr>de</fr></del> several casts, which, however, for <m>gold</m> &amp;
<m>silver</m> is hardly practiced.</ab>
