<ab>They paint in <m>oil</m> without lines, except for the faces where
they trace the nose &amp; the mouth with black in small work, then they
make strokes &amp; highlights in white, next they coat all with
flesh color. And as for the ground, they make it with <m><fr>azur d’<pl>Acre</pl></fr></m> 
for more beauty, or with <m>lake</m> for a quickly-done red, 
or with <m><al>dragon</al>’s blood</m> for the most beauty. But
one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even &amp; of
one color, &amp; thus for other colors. Next they put underneath it a
<m>foil backing for <m>topaz</m>, or one of <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m></m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Tin</m> comes out better being thin &amp; fine, rather than
thick, because being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore,
if you want to mold a thick piece in <m>tin</m>, mold it only on one
side, &amp; with a cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way
you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to <m>solder</m>
two halves together. But if you must mold it thick, make it in the
form &amp; mold a lot of feeders around the figure, in this
way.
