<head>Polishing of the <m>balas ruby</m></head>

<ab>It is not polished with <tl><m>tripoli</m></tl> <del>but</del> like the
others, but with <tl><m>marcasite powder</m></tl> &amp; <m>oil</m>.</ab></div>

<head><m><fr>Or</fr></m> and <m><fr>argent moulu</fr></m></head>

<ab>You need to calcine your <m>fine gold</m> with
<m>☿</m> and then cleanse your amalgam well &amp; make the
said <m>mercury</m> fly off. Next grind it on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>
with <m>gum water</m>. As for <m>silver</m> one needs to take it as
is<comment>c_008v_01</comment> &amp; eat away at it with <m>aquafortis</m>, then take it out with a <tl><m>copper</m> blade</tl>
&amp; rinse it thoroughly and next grind it with <m>gum water</m>.</ab>

<head>Polishing of <m>stones</m></head>

<ab>There are three <tl>wheels for doing this, one of <m>tin</m>, one of
<m>lead</m>, &amp; one of <m>fine copper</m></tl>. On the
<del><fr>cu</fr></del> <tl><m>copper</m> wheel</tl> only the <m>diamond</m>,
the <m>ruby</m>, <m>sapphire</m>, &amp; <m>oriental jacinth</m> are
commonly cut <del><fr>co</fr></del> or polished. The
<tl><m>tin</m> wheel</tl> is for more tender stones like <m>emerald</m>,
<m>amethyst</m>, &amp; others.</ab></div>

<head>Mixture of <pro>Pewterers</pro> <del><ill/></del></head>

<ab>Because among the <m>fine tin</m> they quite often mix a <ms>half</ms>
of <m>lead</m>, which renders the <m>tin</m> <sn>deaf</sn>, to correct
this, they mix in <m>latten filings</m> to render it
<sn>sonorous</sn>.</ab></div>

<head>Perfect amalgam</head>

<ab>Take the most delicate <tl><m><fr>grais</fr></m></tl><comment>c_008v_02</comment> you can &amp; hollow it in
the middle. Put in an <ms>eighth part</ms> of <m>☿</m>,
<del>in</del> &amp; into this, while adding <m>water</m>, rub &amp; wear down your
<m>☾</m> or <m>☼</m> until the
substance becomes like paste &amp; even harder. Next, if you want, eat
it away with good <m>aquafortis</m>, if it is
<m>☾</m> or <m>♀</m>. Then remelt it,
having taken it out as you know. The <m>☾</m> will have a
tint and, once melted, will leave some grains of
<m>☼</m>, &amp; the <m>♀</m> will be
very beautiful &amp; will have almost no film.</ab></div>
