<head>For casting in <m>red copper</m></head>

<ab><m>Pure red copper from a <tl>cauldron</tl> or other thin works</m>
is appropriate for casting. And to make it run, throw in some <m>sal
ammoniac</m>, &amp; when you are ready to cast, put in a little <m>fine
tin</m> &amp; very little. And note that one needs to cast <m>copper</m>
very hot in the <tl>mold</tl>, which needs to also be inflamed &amp;
entirely red like for <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>latten</m> &amp;
<m><fr>metal</fr></m>.<comment rid="c_016v_05"/> You will recognize that it is hot enough when it is
smooth, thin &amp; shiny like a mirror <del>of <fr>cu</fr></del> of
<m>steel</m>, newly polished, or like <m>melted silver</m>. Keep it from
the <env>wind</env>, for it will quickly cool. Stop the cast with
<tl>tows</tl> <del>or</del> to keep it from cooling.</ab></div>

be so hot that it is white &amp; shiny &amp; polished like <m>melted

<m>Copper</m> and <m>latten</m> are the longest to melt, longer than any

like <m>water</m>.</ab>

<ab>Take some <m>â˜¿ sublimate of <pl>Venice</pl></m>,

Pulverize everything separately, &amp; next mix everything in a

that everything dissolves like <m>wax</m>, making many colors. Let it
<del>everything</del> set &amp; put a little of it on each

<pro>Founders of large casts for statues</pro> throw in much

&amp; much <m>sal ammoniac</m> to render it thin &amp; neat. And when
they want to cast, they put in much <m>tin</m>. The <env>cold &amp;

<ab>They are made with <tl>flat pincers of <m>iron wire</m></tl>,
reheated &amp; refolded, then beaten at the ends on the <tl>anvil</tl>.
When they are thus fine, they are subject to burning, being put often
in the <tl>molds</tl> for reheating. Therefore, use some new ones.</ab>
