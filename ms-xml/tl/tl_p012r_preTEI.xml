<head>For molding <m>sulfur</m></head>

<ab><m>Sulfur</m> is made beautiful mixed with <m>soot black</m> or with
<m>pulverized sanguine</m>, which renders it harder and stronger. Having
let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like <m>oil</m>, mix it with
<m>verdigris</m>, and you <del><fr>m</fr></del> will very neatly cast in
<m>plaster</m> a <al>lizard</al> or something else.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



One ought not to cast unless it is well cooled &amp; unless it
has lost all its pustules &amp; bubbles, and has settled down
well &amp; become smooth like <del><ill/></del> <m>water</m>. The
<m>soot black</m> gives it a fine sheen &amp; makes it neater. The most
beautiful yellow <m>sulfur</m> must be used, for the greyish &amp;
lively one is not good. Do not cast <env>in wind</env> &amp;
<env>in cold</env>, for it would become porous.<hr/></ab>

<head><m><fr>Chimolée</fr></m></head>

<ab>The <m><df><fr>terre chimolée</fr></df></m>, otherwise known as
<m><pro><oc>fuller</oc></pro>'s earth</m>, with which they dress the
<m>cloth</m>, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; &amp; if you
want to reheat it, it must first be warm, &amp; reheat it on a gentle
fire at a distance &amp; little by little, otherwise it would crack.
Put the figure to reheat in a <tl>pot</tl> in an <tl>oven</tl> or in a
<tl>covered oven</tl>. It is very soft, neat &amp; beautiful. You
can make a hollow form of animals from <m><fr>chimolée</fr></m> &amp; cast
<m>lead</m> in it.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms> before you reheat
it. When you mold &amp; make a hollow form from <m><fr>chimolée</fr></m>, do
not press suddenly, but gently, for it would crack.</ab>

<head><m>Paper</m></head>

<ab>The whitest &amp; finest is the best. And when the hollow form is quite
clean, as of <m>sulfur</m> or <m>cooked <fr>chimolée</fr></m>, it is made
very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of <m>white</m> with a
border of <m>gold</m> to imitate <m>alabaster</m>. And after you have
applied the <m>white</m>, you can burnish it with the <tl>tooth</tl>.
But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to temper the <m>lead
white</m> with <m>glair of egg</m> &amp; <m>peelings from the <pa>fig
tree</pa></m>. Or better, varnish your work with <m>white varnish</m>.
Also, when you are molding with <m>paper</m>, as it starts to dry,
burnish from the back with the <tl>tooth</tl>.</ab>
