<ab>One needs to make a <m>wooden</m> pipe as<ms> long as the width of 4
or 5 <bp>fingers</bp></ms>, which should be hollowed precisely according
to the mouth of your barrel, of the form represented in <del>D</del> A.
Then, having cut <m>strong paper, <del>of the</del> as of large printed
books</m>, in the form of D, as <ms>wide as you want to make your
cartridge<comment rid="c_045r_01"/> long</ms>, wrap the <m>paper</m>
around the <tl>baton</tl> B &amp; at the end, where the point F will be,
fold all around the said <m>paper</m>, &amp; your cartridge will be
formed. But in order to make the bottom more uniform, put it into
<tl>pipe</tl> A, then put in the <tl>baton</tl> B and, through the other
end of the <tl>pipe</tl>, which is marked G, put the <tl>baton</tl> C
&amp; beat so as to tamp &amp; press the folded tip of your cartridge,
then take it out, &amp; load it. Put three or 4
pieces of shot or
tears<comment rid="c_045r_03"/> into it. Then, with a
<tl>cutting-punch</tl>, marked E, which should be of the same caliber as
your <wp>arquebus</wp> or <wp>pistol</wp>, punch round pieces on <m>cardboard</m> or
<m>felt</m> or <m>waxed cloth</m>, and put this round piece into your
cartridge, and push it onto the pieces of shot with the
<tl>baton</tl> B. Next, more pieces of shot, 3 or 4, then a round
piece. And do thus until the cartridge is full, then put it into your
<wp>arquebus</wp>. If you want your hail shot to scatter sooner, make the round
pieces out of <m>paper</m>. If you want it to reach farther without
scattering, make the piece out of <m>cardboard</m>. If you want even
farther, make the round piece out of <m>waxed cloth</m>, or else of
<m>leather</m> or <m>felt</m>, &amp; a piece of <m>waxed cloth</m> on
the top. And if you make the cartridge itself of <m>waxed cloth</m> or
<m>waxed paper</m>, it will reach one hundred <ms>paces</ms> &amp; will
make for great piercing, &amp; the hail shot, barely scattering, will
make an opening. But if you make your cartridge with <m>waxed cloth</m>
or a material stronger than <m>paper</m>, you ought not to make so long
the part coming from the square to the point as in D, because it is enough
that it wraps around twice. <mark>#</mark> In this manner, the hail
shot barely scatters &amp; makes for great piercing against a door,
cuirass body,<comment rid="c_045r_04"/> and others.</ab>
