For loosening the belly

Prunes of Saint Antonin, &amp; if you like
you want put among them leaves of mallow &amp;
gilliflower, adding in sugar &amp;, if one wants, a
little cinnamon for the stomach.

Or else marshmallow root in a chicken
broth. The fresh kind is more mollifying.

Beating syrup of sweet jujubes with water &amp;
taking it in the morning loosens the belly.
