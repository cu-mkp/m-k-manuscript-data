<m>agate</m> of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in
a <m>brick</m> of the exact size of the thing &amp; put it inside. Then
I reddened two <tl><pro>glassworkers'</pro>
solders</tl><comment>c_013r_01</comment>, &amp; as they were red, I
presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I
got the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I
wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a <tl><m>diamond</m>
point</tl>, and I polished it with <tl><m><al>hog</al> bristles</m></tl>
and <tl><m>tripoli</m></tl>. I do not know if it would be better to
reheat it under hot <m>ashes</m>, &amp; if it would be good to encase it
in <m>alabaster</m>, which is very cold, as I encased it in the
<m>brick</m>.</ab>

<head>Carnation from <m>arsenic</m></head>

<ab><m>Sublimated arsenic</m>, that is to say, the white one that is
sold as <m>stone</m>, when ground on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, mixed with
<m>vermilion</m> or <m>lake</m> or <m>minium</m>, makes a beautiful
flesh color that is always shiny. <m>Yellow arsenic</m> has a very
beautiful color, the white one is good in <m>oil</m> and agrees well
with the <m>lake</m>.</ab>

<ab>Mix <m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; <m>vitriol</m> &amp; boil them
together. Then mix in <m>lake</m> or <m>verdet</m> &amp; <m>azure</m> or
similar, &amp; dye. This will not come off unless the <al>animal</al>
sheds. @<la>Non bona</la>.</ab>

<ab>One makes <m>tammy of raw silk</m> on a <tl>loom</tl>, to make
<tl>fine &amp; delicate sieves</tl>. And for that effect, you must not
choose <m><m>raw silk</m> whitened by <m>sulfur smoke</m></m>, which
renders the <m>silk</m> <del><fr>chas</fr></del> charged with a sticky
vapor that would hold the <m>flour</m> &amp; in the end would prevent it
