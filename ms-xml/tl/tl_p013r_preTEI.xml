<m>agate</m> of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in
a <m>brick</m> of the exact size of the thing &amp; put it inside. Then
I reddened two <tl><pro>glassworkers'</pro>
solders</tl>, &amp; as they were red, I
presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I
had the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I
wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a <tl><m>diamond</m>
point</tl>, and I polished it with <tl>small <m><al>hog</al> bristle</m> brushes</tl>
and <tl><m>tripoli</m></tl>. I do not know if it would be better to
reheat it under hot <m>ashes</m>, &amp; if it would be good to encase it
in <m>alabaster</m>, which is very cold, as I encased it in the
<m>brick</m>.</ab>
