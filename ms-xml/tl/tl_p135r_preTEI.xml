It is necessary that it be longish with regard to the thing that you
molded. And for <tl>big molds</tl>, at the very least, it is necessary
that it have four or five <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> of length. You can
make it wide up until the middle &amp; then divide it in three points in
this way. And as much as the molded thing will be small, it is also necessary
that your points be small. And in the middle of the gate &amp; of its
points, make there some openings in order to prevent the fury of the
<m>metal</m> &amp; make it run gently. One also needs to
<del><fr>c</fr></del> conjoin the folded parts of the animal with little
notched lines, <del><fr>a</fr></del> especially the end of the tail or
other delicate part, in order that the <m>metal</m> flows everywhere
&amp; carries itself from <del><fr>e l</fr></del><comment rid="c_135r_02"/> one part to the
other.</ab>

Do not forget to make a gate of <m>wax</m> for the feet of <al><oc>
    
lizards</oc></al> &amp; delicate things like this.</ab>

When you <add>have</add> molded an animal in the first part of the
<tl>mold</tl>, do not let this part dry before you have taken away the
said animal, for the <tl>mold</tl>, in drying, contracts and would also
make the animal contract. Keep it therefore in some <env>moist &amp;
humid place</env> until you have done it.</ab>

Take <pa>vine</pa> leaves to mold as they are in growth, likewise with
all plants &amp; flowers, or a young <pa>vine</pa> growing again after
having been cut, or when they rebud <tmp>in autumn</tmp>, because the
new leaves are more lumpy &amp; have more apparent lineation. On the
contrary, old leaves are smooth on the inside &amp; pierced in several
places. Therefore place your leaf bottom down on the <tl><m>clay</m>
slab</tl>, and secure it with <tl>small points</tl>, nevertheless
leaving it its natural curve. And make a notch <add>in the
<m>clay</m></add> to hide the stem at the first cast, which, once made
&amp; dry, you will take away the stem from the leaf &amp; clean with it
well with <tl>small bristle brushes</tl> &amp; fix it with a small mound
of <m>clay</m>. Next, make several gates around the leaf with <m>wax</m>,
as you know, &amp; <del><fr>gec</fr></del> make the gate thin &amp; with
several lines &amp; lumpy.</ab>
