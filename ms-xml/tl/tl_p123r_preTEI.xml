<ab>Take these substances, of the best kind you can find. Weigh them as
said above, and <tl>pestle</tl> them separately, keeping your
<bp><bp>face</bp></bp> covered, over the <bp>nose</bp> &amp; the
<bp>mouth</bp>, from the <bp>eyes</bp> down, to avoid the exhalations of
<m>arsenic</m>, <m>sublimate</m>, and <m>orpiment</m>. Mix them well, all
together, then put them in a <tl>good <oc>crucible</oc></tl> that is so large
that the substances can have the <ms>fourth or fifth part</ms> as empty space.
Cover the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> with a <tl>good tile</tl>, adapted in a
circle precisely on its opening. And having bound it from top to bottom
and on the sides with <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl> quite strongly, <m><tl>lute</tl></m> it
with <m>earth mixed with dung or founder’s earth that <pro><wp>artillery</wp>
founders</pro> use</m>. And in this, be careful &amp; diligent, &amp; do
not forget to mix in <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m> throughout the <m><tl>lute</tl></m> to
fortify your <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> in such a manner that it takes no air, for the
substance would be worth little, because the <del>4</del>
<add>five</add> last ingredients would be exhaled. </ab>

<ab margin="right-middle">

Note that you need to <m><tl>lute</tl></m> well your <tl>crucible</tl>, in order that the
substances do not take air, for they are exhaled.</ab>

<ab margin="right-middle">

  
<m><tl>Lute</tl></m> well your <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, in order that it does not break. For
if it breaks, the substances evaporate &amp; the <md>fumes of it are
dangerous</md>. If within xii <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> it is not melted
and mixed, it will not be well made. </ab>

<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> who have knowledge of this substance sell a
<ms><fr>denier</fr></ms> of it for five <ms><cn>sous</cn></ms> to other
<pro>goldsmiths</pro>, &amp; especially to <pro>those who work in plate
and large wares</pro>, for at the end of their works, they can <m>solder</m>
over the first <m>solder</m> by means of this mixture. In general, all
those who want to mold &amp; cast something delicate. This material
should not be divulged, lest it be abused.</ab>
