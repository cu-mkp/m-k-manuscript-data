<head>Shadows</head>

<ab> Because blacks make different colors, some a reddish black, others
tending toward blue, and others toward green, choose those which tend
toward yellow to make beautiful shadows in <m>oil</m>, for the shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground <m>jet</m>, which you will mix with a little
<m><add>yellow</add> ocher</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m>. Or else, after
you have ground your <m>lead white</m> <del><fr>bro</fr></del> and
    <del>clean <fr>p</fr></del> gathered it with the <figure size="x-small" id="fig_p065r_1" link="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5UFZyOUNKU3pqVXc">





</figure>, grind the <m>jet</m> into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, &amp; making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men’s shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women’s shadows. Take, then, some
black of <gap/>, a little <m>sap green</m> &amp; <m>bistre</m>, &amp;
you will have a perfect shadow for women in <m>distemper</m>.</ab>

but it does not have body.</ab>

<head>Flesh color</head>

<ab>You must know well the mixing of colors &amp; the appropriate
shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note &amp;
observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise,
as if going from <del><fr>l<exp>ett</exp>re a ga</fr></del> right to
left like

</figure>, and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.</ab>

<head><tl>Mirror</tl></head>

<ab>When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a
<tl><m><fr>cristallin</fr></m> mirror</tl>, which represents
nature well, and in which <del>it</del> you will see if your
shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a
<tl>candle</tl>, for <env>firelight</env> will make the shadows reddish.
The <pro>painter</pro> also teaches himself with the <tl>mirror</tl>,
for he sees in it what nature can do.</ab>

<head>Fatty colors</head>

<ab>If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
colors have penetrated, it means that this place is fatty, &amp; that
the second colors one layers on would not take easily, unless
you rub this place with <m>soap</m> or <bp>breathe</bp> on it, because the
humidity will make the colors take.</ab>

<ab margin="left-top" render="tall">



One cannot layer <m>oil</m> on cut <m>paper</m> &amp; model as in
<m>distemper</m> because the color would run. Thus, to <m>gild</m> with

All fatty colors, such as <m>ceruse</m> and <m>minium</m>,
<m>massicot</m>, <m>ocher</m>, <m>lead white</m>, are good for making
gold color.</ab>

Every color or thing that becomes dense when <m>water</m> is put in during the
