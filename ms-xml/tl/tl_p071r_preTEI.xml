<head>Mulled and sugared <m>wine</m></head>

<ab>

The <pl>English</pl>, when they feel a cold coming on, mull <m>wine</m> in this
manner. They heat it in a <del>large</del> <tl><m>tin</m> pot</tl> until
it boils, and when it is boiling up, they <del>remove it from</del>
light it with <tl><m>burning paper</m></tl> <ms>to know if it is hot
enough</ms>. Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one
<tl>vessel</tl> into another, as one who wants to beat <m><fr>eau
pan√©e</fr></m>, and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a
<tl><m>burning paper</m></tl> what is falling from one <tl>vessel</tl> into the
other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the
<m>wine</m> is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few
<m><pa>cloves</pa></m> &amp; a <ms>sufficient quantity</ms> of <m>sugar</m>. And
they <del><fr>boi</fr></del> drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.</ab>

owing to the <tmp>long sea crossing</tmp>, the <m>wine</m> has lost its
sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.</ab>
