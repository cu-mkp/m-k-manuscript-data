<ab>I tried the <m>bone of <al>oxen</al> <add>feet</add>, thoroughly burned &amp;
pulverized</m> &amp; ground on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, until it <sn>is
not felt between your <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl></sn>. It molds on its
own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid &amp; lean, it
wants to be well wettted &amp; moistened with <m>wine boiled with
<pa>elm</pa> root</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Iron dross</m>, <m>well burned bone of <al>oxen</al> feet</m>,
<m>felt also well burned</m> over a closed fire, and all three very well
ground on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl> mold very neatly in <m>lead</m>,
without needing to be reheated a lot, &amp; casting
<del><fr>le</fr></del> <add>in a</add> hot or cold <tl>frame</tl>.</ab>

<ab><m>Felt</m> alone molds very neatly once moistened &amp; releases
well, and also makes the other two release.</ab>

A <m>fatty sand</m> which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.</ab>

<ab>Some people think that <m>salt water</m> is not good, because the
<m>salt</m> cracks in fire, &amp; consequently should make it porous. There is only the <m>wine boiled with <pa>elm</pa>
root</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Charcoal for pouncing</m> makes for a good release, but
one finds that <m>the one of <pa>willow</pa></m> makes it porous. <m>The one
of <pa>oak</pa> or <pa>beech</pa></m> does <del>make it porous</del> well without making it
porous.</ab>

<ab> I took <m>ceruse</m> and crushed it dry on
