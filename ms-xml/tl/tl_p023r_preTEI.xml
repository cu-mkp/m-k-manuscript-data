<head><sup>On petards</sup></head>
<ab>Such a <wp>petard</wp><comment rid="c_008r_04"/> is made which weighs three <ms>quintals</ms>, carries
a cannonball flat on the side on which it must exit &amp; round on the
inside of the <wp>cannon</wp>, as if it were a cannonball cut in half. It is two
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long. It is charged with xxv <ms>lb</ms> of
<m>powder</m> for <del>at</del> it needs to be full up to the mouth
&amp; it needs to burst. It does not have a different thickness at the
breech than at the mouth &amp; is all of one piece. Its substance needs
to be better than that of <wp>pieces</wp>, &amp; for 4 <ms>quintals</ms> of
<m>fine copper</m> there ought to be only one <ms>quintal</ms> of
<m><fr>metal</fr></m> in order that it holds the blast, &amp;, bursting with more
force, has a greater effect. It is for putting against a door with a
large <m>iron</m> cross in front of the ball, and <del><fr>s</fr></del>once loaded, it needs
to be covered with a well-sewn <m>thick canvas</m> which should be
anointed <del><fr>c</fr></del> all over with <m>turpentine</m>. It needs
to have four handles, made while it is founded, for it <add>is</add> thus easier to
place. The <m>iron</m> cross is joined to the mouth with the
<m>canvas</m> with which it is covered. <del>To place it, it</del> The
handles must be kept at the edge of its muzzle, as you see. To place it,
one needs three or four <tl><m>iron</m> pegs</tl> one
<ms><fr>pan</fr></ms> long <add>&amp; as thick as a
<ms><bp>finger</bp></ms></add> which should have their point like a
<del><tl>wimble</tl></del><comment rid="c_168r_01"/> <add><tl>gimlet</tl>, &amp; the entire leg as
a <tl>screw</tl>, like an <tl>auger</tl></add>, &amp; a ring on the
other end to turn them with a <tl>short stick</tl> which has play within
the ring. And the <tl>pegs</tl> are placed in the door <del>but</del>
not straight <del>but</del> for they would not have any strength, but at an
angle as if <add>you</add> wanted to fix them toward the middle of the
<wp>petard</wp>, and to do this, the hole of the handles needs to be quite large.
In this way, the firing <wp>petard</wp> pushes the <tl>pegs</tl> along &amp;
across into the door &amp; makes more of a breach. Once it is placed,
you need to have a <m>buckram</m> sausage<comment rid="c_023r_01"/>
made in this manner: take eight or nine <ms><fr>canes</fr></ms> of
<m>buckram strip</m> or more if the ditch is larger, and let the strip
be four or five <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> wide. Have it well sewn in
such a way that it is like a gut through <del><fr>l</fr></del>which<comment rid="c_023r_02"/> a
<tl>stick</tl> as thick as a <ms><bp>finger</bp></ms> can pass. Fill it
completely with good</ab>

This one is for putting below an undermined tower with the muzzle
pointing up. One makes two large <m>iron</m> rings &amp; with a
<tl>bar</tl> or two, four men carry it. They are also used for putting
in breaches but here one needs only half a charge, namely x <ms>lb</ms>,
&amp; to fill it with <m>flint stones</m> &amp; <m>cart flint
stones</m></ab>.

One needs to cover it entirely with <m>waxed canvas</m> &amp; rubbed
with <m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m>combustible things</m>. This cover is
made in order to secure the ball, such that it does not fall and in
order that when the fire takes to the cover, the <m>primer powder</m>
does not fail. Precisely at the fuse, you will need to put in a good
quantity of <m>primer powder</m>. Some put a cross of <m>iron</m> on the
ball which exptends beyond the mouth of the <wp>petard</wp> by two
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms>. Others only put the ball.</ab>
