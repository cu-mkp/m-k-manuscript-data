<ab>The end<comment rid="c_095v_03"/> is bought ready-made by the
<ms>dozen</ms>, which costs six <ms><cn>sous</cn></ms> for
the small ones, but for the the big ones 2
<ms><cn>carolus</cn></ms>. The end <del>this</del> is put either
with <tl>nails</tl>, which are put on the sides of the cutting edge, but
this only spoils the <wp>sword</wp> &amp; destroys the scabbard because the
<m>water</m> enters through the joint of the <tl>nail</tl>. It is best to
apply some <m>rosin</m> or <m>glue</m> on it, but <m>rosin</m> is better.
And it is best when the end is well adjusted &amp; set so hot that the
<m>pulverized rosin</m> melts on the end. In this way, it does not fall
and cannot be undone unless it is put in the fire.</ab>

<ab><wp>Guards</wp> are of several kinds:<lb/>

Worked<comment rid="c_095v_04"/><lb/>

Guttered, which is with round moldings<lb/>

<m>Pearled</m><lb/>

Scarfed, when the bands are crosswise<lb/>

Onioned, which is with a flat head<comment rid="c_095v_05"/><lb/>

In the <pro>King</pro>'s manner, which are plain</ab>

<ab>The <pro>furbishers</pro> buy them by <ms>dozens</ms>, the
<ms>dozen</ms> of plain ones commonly costs x <ms><cn>lb</cn></ms>. The
worked piece, 30 <ms><cn>sous</cn></ms> or depending on its
fashion.</ab>

<ab>The first thing the <pro>apprentice</pro> does is to furbish as
said.</ab>

<ab>And next, to garnish the <wp>sword</wp> &amp; make a scabbard, which is the
height of the art.</ab>

<ab>They buy the <m>wood</m> pieces of
<m><pa>beech</pa> wood</m> for scabbards which are ready made, a hundred for xv or xx or 30
<ms><cn>sous</cn></ms>, depending on the distance from the place
where they are made.</ab>

<ab>These <m>wood</m> pieces are thus called
<df><fr>estelles</fr>,</df><comment rid="c_095v_06"/> and have to be
very neat &amp; without any knots &amp; are one <ms><bp>finger</bp>'s
thickness across</ms>.</ab>

<ab>Then the <pro>furbisher</pro> puts them on a small bench, called a
<df><tl>scabbard bench</tl></df>, and with a <del><fr>e</fr></del><comment rid="c_095v_01"/>
<del><tl>plane</tl></del> <tl>small <m>iron</m>
tool</tl> similar to that of the <tl>joiners' bench</tl>,
they make it hold firmly. Then, with a <del><tl>plane</tl></del>
<tl>plane</tl> which is like a <tl>knife with two
handles</tl>,<comment rid="c_095v_07"/> one works the <m>wood</m>
roughly from the top, next one passes the <tl><pro>joiner</pro>'s
