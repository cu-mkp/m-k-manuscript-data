Flowers are also kept in their same beauty in <m>distilled vinegar</m>
<del><fr>v</fr></del> in a <tl>well-sealed vessel</tl> which does not
accept any wind, which should be well sealed with <m>wax</m> &amp;
<m>mastic</m>. <pa>Carnations</pa> &amp;<pa> roses</pa>, the <m>residue
of common vinegar</m> makes them rot. If the <m>sand</m> makes
<m>dust</m>, &amp; clings to the flowers, &amp; is not easily removed
with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>, it is no good. The leanest is the
best.</ab>

<m><env>River</env> sand</m> washed by the <env>current of the
waters</env>, is good once passed through a <tl><m>linen</m> cloth</tl>
to shake the powder.</ab>

<ab>This is a rare secret, &amp; which gives pleasure for adorning
tables, <env>rooms</env>, &amp; <env>cabinets</env> <tmp>out of season
when winter denies flowers</tmp>. Take heed, therefore, to
<del><fr>ce</fr></del> pick them when they are in full vigor &amp;
growing. For if you were to take them <ms>when their <tmp>season</tmp>
is past</ms>, or when they are starting to wilt, they would not keep.
Having thus chosen them, therefore, take <m>sand</m>, the leanest &amp;
driest you can find, which should be very fine, like that which
<pro>goldsmiths</pro> <del>use</del> <add>use</add> to work
<m>enamel</m>, or like that for impressions. But above all it must not
make <m>dust</m>, nor remain on the <bp>hand</bp> or leave a mark on it
when you have pulverized <corr>it</corr> &amp; then poured it from your
<bp>hand</bp>. For it is</ab>

Make sure your <tl>box</tl> is well joined in order that the <m>sand</m>
does not trickle out. Keep it uncovered <env>in sunlight</env> and
remove it from the <env><fr>serain</fr>, &amp; the humidity of the
night</env>, &amp; cover it &amp; keep it in a <env>dry
place</env>.</ab>

Take good heed not to pick your flowers <del>w</del> in <env>rainy and
humid weather</env>, but when the <env>sun</env> has been shining on
them.</ab>
