<ab>When one takes them with two <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> from the
sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their
<del><fr>g</fr></del> mouth, then one takes the <del><fr>a</fr></del>
end of its lower mandible <add>with the end of the
<tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl></add>, &amp; next, with the upper mandible,
he bites the <tl><bp>nail</bp></tl>, but he cannot pass through, but he
clenches very strongly. And if he were to bite living <bp>flesh</bp> it would
<del><fr>au</fr></del> not let go, &amp; there would be no better remedy
than to promptly cut off his head. <tmp>In the spring</tmp>, as they
have changed skin, they are more beautiful.</ab>

The small <al>lizards</al> that one takes in the <tmp>summer</tmp>, the
size of small <al>female lizards</al>, grey on the back &amp; green on
the belly, are very appropriate to cast in <m>silver</m> &amp;
<m>gold</m>, or other <m>metal</m>, because they have rougher scales
than the <al>female lizards</al> &amp; show better.
