<ab>The large <wp>cannon</wp>, which is for great
batteries,<comment rid="c_017v_01"/> commonly weighs fifty-five or lx
<ms>quintals</ms>. At the breech it carries the <ms>thickness of
<del><fr>b</fr></del> two balls &amp; <add>one</add> 
<del><fr>l</fr></del>of<comment rid="c_017v_04"/> the three parts of one ball</ms>. At the front, it carries
<del><fr>ba</fr></del> the <ms>thickness of one ball &amp;
<del>two</del> two of the three parts</ms>. It is thirteen or fourteen
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long. But they are very troublesome to drive. The
head-on battery, to accomplish its task quickly <del>is</del> &amp;
batter with great force, is at <del><fr>d</fr></del> one-hundred fifty
<ms>paces</ms> &amp; at two hundred. <del>And</del> It is true that one
batters well from three or 4 hundred <ms>paces</ms>, but it is necessary
to give it more <m>powder</m>. Its common load is <del><fr>p</fr></del>
of xx <ms>lb</ms> of <m>powder</m>, its ball of 40 <ms>lb</ms>. One
needs xxv <al>horses</al> to draw it. When one fires it farther than its
usual range, one puts in a <ms>half <tl>ladle</tl></ms> of <m><wp>cannon</wp>
powder</m> more. A <wp>cannon</wp> can fire
4<superscript>xx</superscript><comment rid="c_017v_02"/> or a hundred shots <ms>per
<tmp>day</tmp></ms>, but one needs to refresh it every time after one
has fired <del><fr>di</fr></del> nine or ten shots, if the battery is steadily
continued. For if there is a break, it is not necessary to refresh it as
often. For two <ms>quintals</ms> of <m>copper</m>, or two <ms>quintals
&amp; a half</ms> if it is for large <wp>cannons</wp>, one puts one
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m><fr>metal</fr></m>.<comment rid="c_016v_05"/> <add><mark>#</mark></add><comment rid="c_112r_02"/> The
<m><fr>metal</fr></m> is composed at the beginning of eight <ms>lb</ms> of
<m>tin</m> for one <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>rosette</m>, while
for large bells one only puts six <ms>lb</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> for one
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m>rosette</m>, to give it a <sn>bigger
voice</sn>. For the more <m>tin</m> there is, the clearer the
<sn>sound</sn> is. <del>Its</del> For <wp>gun</wp> founding, if one provides the
material &amp; <m>charcoal</m>, as one commonly does, for
<pro>masters</pro> do not have the means, one gives x to xii
<ms><cn>lb</cn> per quintal</ms>. And <del>for the mat</del> when the
<pro>master</pro> provides everything, one gives him 40 <ms><cn>lb</cn>,
<add>according to the <pro>King</pro>’s ordinance</add>, per
quintal</ms> for <wp>large pieces</wp> <del>&amp;</del> such as <wp>cannons</wp>, and for
<wp>small pieces</wp>, L <ms><cn>lb</cn></ms>. For the more material there is,
the more profit the <pro>master</pro> has of it. One founds another kind
of <wp>cannon-perriers</wp> of xxx <ms>quintals</ms> which are longer than the
others, and easily eight <ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long, &amp; they are for
battering defenses &amp; <env>casemates</env>, <del><fr>s</fr></del>
placing them via <env>trenches</env> on the <env>edge of the ditch</env>
<tmp>by night</tmp>.</ab>

On each side of the opening of the breech they give the <ms>thickness of
half a ball</ms>. And then they also add on each side the <ms>third part
of a ball</ms>.</ab>

The composition of <wp>cannons</wp> of <pl>France</pl> is of <ms>one quintal of
<m><fr>metal</fr></m> for two of <m>rosette</m></ms>.
