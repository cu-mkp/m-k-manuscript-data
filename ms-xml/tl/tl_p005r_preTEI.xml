<head><m>Steel</m> mirrors</head>

<ab><mark>X</mark><comment rid="c_084v_02"/> They are called of <m>steel</m> because in times
past they were commonly made of <m>steel</m> polished with
<tl><m>emery putty</m></tl>. But more easily, various kinds are made
with <df><m><fr>cuivre franc</fr></m></df>, which is <m>rosette</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m>, because it is cast in a <tl>mold</tl> &amp; made
round, concave, convex &amp; however one likes, to represent various
forms.</ab>
    

<ab>So take <ms>half</ms> <m>rosette copper</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms>
<df><m>soft tin</m></df>, that is to say fine, which has not yet been used.
Put them in a <tl>crucible</tl>, &amp; first melt the <m>copper</m>
well. And once it is well melted, put in the <m>tin</m> and mix
together. Then cast in the <tl>mold, of <m>white stone</m> with no
eyelets</tl>, &amp; anoint the <tl>mold</tl> with <m>oil</m>, &amp; let
it be moderately warm. Then, having
<tl>molded</tl> your mirror, you can polish it in this way.</ab>

<ab>Set one of these in <m>plaster</m> in order that it holds firmly,
&amp; then put the other one over it with <tl><m>thin sand</m></tl> in between,
&amp; rub one against the other, whether it be concave or flat, &amp; thus you
will polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides,
you only need to switch them, that is to say put the one that was
polishing into the <m>plaster</m> &amp; the one that was in the
<m>plaster</m> to polish. After having polished them with the
<tl><m><fr>arene</fr></m></tl> you can smooth them with <tl><m><pl>Venice</pl> tripoli</m></tl>, 
which should not be sandy, &amp; next with
<tl><m>putty</m></tl>. You polish with
<tl><m><fr>arene</fr></m></tl> using <m>water</m>, but polishing with
<tl><m>tripoli</m></tl> &amp; <tl><m>putty</m></tl> is done
dry. Once polished, you can set it.</ab>

<head>Concave mirrors</head>

<ab>The concave mirror composed in the aforesaid form produces an
endless number of pretty conceits which seem magic. If someone wants to see
oneself from behind, it is necessary to place the <tl>concave
mirror</tl> on the ground on its foot, &amp; let it be at a slant;
next, <add>look</add> at it from one <ms>pace</ms> away. But if you
look at it close up, it will represent you the right way up but
with your <bp>face</bp> quite large &amp; the <bp>hairs of your
beard</bp> as thick as</ab>
