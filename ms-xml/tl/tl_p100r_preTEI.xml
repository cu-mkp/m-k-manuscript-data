<head>Gold color</head>

<ab>To quickly make a layer of <m><fr>or</fr> <del>on</del>
<fr>mat</fr></m> on <m>canvas</m> or other <m>oil panel</m>, one makes fatty
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> <env>in the sun</env> or <env>on the
fire</env>, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way,
although there is neither <m>lead</m> nor <m>ceruse</m>. And with this,
grind <m>massicot</m>, <m>minium</m> &amp; other desiccatives,
not <m>verdet</m> nor <m>orpiment</m>, for they cause the
<m>gold</m> to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the
<env><tmp>weather is not <fr>serain</fr> &amp; dry</tmp></env>, do not smooth it,
for if the <env><tmp>weather is musty &amp; humid</tmp></env>, it would
turn black.</ab>

<head>Vitrified <m>saltpeter</m></head>

<ab>

Being melted with <m>pebbles</m>, it makes the <m>glass</m> very white.
But before, one needs to calcine it on a <tl>hot tile or shovel</tl>. And that which will remain from the vapor, mix it with <ms>as
much of the <m>white calcined pebbles</m></ms>. It is true that, in the
<tl>little furnace</tl>, it does not clarify well. But for <m>large panes of
glass</m>, it makes the <m>glass</m> very clear &amp; white &amp;
clean.</ab>

<ab>Take the aforesaid <m>calcined saltpeter</m> &amp; expose it to
a <env>humid air or place</env>, and it will convert itself into a
liquor which, if rubbed <add>on both sides</add> of the windows, the
<env>sun</env> will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One
needs to put the <m>saltpeter</m> on some clean <del>thing</del>
