<head>Colors and <m>gilding</m> on <m>glass</m></head>

<ab>One ought not to give as strong <m>gum water</m> on <m>glass</m> for
<del>the <m>gold</m> as for</del> the <m>silver</m> layer as for the
<m>gold</m> because a <m>silver</m> leaf is twice as strong as a
<m>gold</m> leaf. Also, <m>silver</m> is harder and therefore does not
scratch as easily. <del><fr>Q</fr></del> And if the <m>gum</m> was not a
little strong for the <m>silver</m>, the latter would not split so
neatly. When you work, <del>the humid</del> the exhalation of your
<bp>breath</bp> moistens the leaf laid on the <m>glass</m>, &amp;
therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times.
You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank
&amp; serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not
quite clean of the <m>gum</m>'s greasiness &amp; viscosity,
<del>the</del> &amp; of other things, the colors would not be so neat
on it. To advance your works, you can pounce, or, better still,
layer the <m>gum</m> &amp; leaf on a cut <m>paper</m>. In this way, you
will only need to repair very little. If you want to make <m>gold</m> color
there without <m>gold</m>, mix soaked dried <pa>saffron</pa> with a little
<m>massicot</m>.
