<ab>The best, fattest &amp; softest is brought from <pl>Germany</pl> and
is not in <fr>saulmon</fr>,<comment rid="c_028v_04"/> but in <fr>lattes</fr> of around an
<ms><bp>arm's</bp></ms> length &amp; three <ms><bp>fingers'</bp></ms> width.
It is transported to <pl>Lyon</pl>, and from this, the leaf is made for
small mirrors in <pl>Nuremberg</pl>.</ab>

<ab>They also make their <tl>molds</tl> from <m>metal</m> which lasts
longer &amp; molds more cleanly than <m><fr>grais</fr></m>,<comment rid="c_008v_02"/> because the
plate comes out without flashing &amp; smooth. But this is for the

<pro>rich</pro> because a <tl>mold</tl> costs fifteen or sixteen
<cn>frans</cn>. They are mainly made of <m>metal</m>, for basins &amp;
ewers &amp; salt cellars &amp; similar things which are fashioned.</ab>

<ab>For pints,<comment rid="c_030r_01"/> <tl>molds</tl> are made with
<m>white clay earth</m> mixed with <m><al>horse</al> dung</m> &amp; <m>cloth
waste</m> &amp; well beaten, because the pints, being sunk in a half round,
would not be able to release as well from the <tl><m><fr>grais</fr></m> mold</tl>
as from the <m>earth</m>, which is soft. One makes the <fr>noyau</fr> of 
the <tl>mold</tl> of the said pints in <fr>grais</fr>.</ab>

<ab>In <tl>metal molds</tl>, one makes vents and casts all at once,
which is the reason that in the middle of the dish, no smoky black line
which comes from the vapor &amp; fumes of the <m>metal</m> that is cast,
which is the cause that in that spot, the work is lumpy &amp; very often
pierced. However they repair it with <m>solder</m> <del><fr>du
n</fr></del>, as is said. These fumes are made right in the middle of the
cast, &amp; in <tl><m><fr>grais</fr></m> molds</tl>.</ab>

<ab>The plate can be <tl>hammered</tl> <del><fr>mar</fr></del> to make
it more vendable. But it will not last as long.</ab>

<ab>Depending on the size of their platters &amp; plates, they have
notches on the spoke of their <tl><m>iron</m> wheels</tl>. And when they
want to apply</ab>
