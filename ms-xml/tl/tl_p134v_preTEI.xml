vinegar</m> until it is fine, like a <m><fr>couleur</fr></m> and
<m>verdet</m> ground in <m>oil</m>. Next, leave it to dry on its own if

For <m>gold</m> casts for large works</head>

<ab>

One needs not only to <tl>clamp</tl> the <tl>molds</tl>well, but to
fortify them with good ties of <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl> or <tl>little
bands</tl> made for this.</ab>

Before casting in <m>gold</m>, clean your <tl>forge</tl> well of

<head>Secret for <m>soldering</m> <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> for
small works</head>

<ab>

If some piece of small foot does not come out well in <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>, by fault of not having made, underneath, a gate of
<m>wax</m>, beat some <m>soldering gold</m> very thinly, then cut it in
as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this <m><bp>phlegm
</bp></m> or <m><bp>white thick <del>which</del> saliva that is found on
the <bp>teeth</bp></bp></m>, &amp; with the point of a <tl>burin</tl>,
apply it to the place you want to <m>solder</m> &amp; place there a
<m>little spangle of gold</m> &amp; next, with a little <m>fat
earth</m>, wet with <m><bp>saliva</bp></m>, make a small layer, on the
opposite side, to hold <m>solder</m> better. Next, pulverize on top a
little <m>borax</m> &amp; put in the fire. <m>Boiled water of
<pa>quince</pa> seed</m> &amp; others also.</ab>
