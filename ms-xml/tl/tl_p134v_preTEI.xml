<head>Secret for <m>soldering</m> <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> in
small works</head>

<ab>

If some piece of small foot does not come out well in <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>, by fault of not having made a gate of
<m>wax</m> underneath, beat some <m>soldering gold</m> very thinly, then cut it in
as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this <m><bp>phlegm
</bp></m> or <m><bp>white thick <del>which</del> saliva that is found on
the <bp>teeth</bp></bp></m>, &amp; with the point of a <tl>burin</tl>,
apply it to the place you want to <m>solder</m>, &amp; place there a
<m>little spangle of gold</m>; &amp; next, with a little <m>fat
earth</m> wetted with <m><bp>saliva</bp></m>, make a small layer on the
opposite side to hold the <m>solder</m> better. Next, pulverize on top a
little <m>borax</m> &amp; put in the fire. <m>Boiled water of
<pa>quince</pa> seed</m> &amp; others also.</ab>
