<head><m>Soldering</m> a <tl><oc>vise</oc></tl></head>

<ab>It is good that the jaws of the <tl><oc>vise</oc></tl> should be high to make
a long piece in it, and that the jaws join well to clamp a delicate
object. To <m>solder</m> the <tl>nut</tl>, after you have forged the
<tl>bolt</tl>, you <del>will make</del> will forge a long <m>iron
strip</m> <del><fr>quar</fr></del> of such thickness that it can fit
into the notch of the <tl>bolt</tl> when red hot, &amp; you will bend it
<del><fr>po</fr></del> all around, striking it with a <tl>hammer</tl>.
Once it is well <del><fr>jo</fr></del> wrapped around, you will insert
<del>it</del> the <tl>bolt</tl> <del><fr>o</fr></del> around which
<del>is</del> it is wrapped.</ab>

<head><m>Copper</m></head>

<ab>If, in the fire &amp; melt, it touches the <m>iron</m>, this
<m>iron</m> will be so brittle afterward that it cannot be
forged.</ab>

<head>Casting of <m>lead</m></head>

<ab>One mixes it, according to some, <ms>half</ms> <m>tin</m> &amp;
<ms>half</ms> <m>lead</m>, and to <fr>l'esch</fr><del><ill/></del> <add>heat</add> it,
one mixes in a little <m>sublimate</m>. It casts well in small works in
a <tl><m><al>cuttlefish</al> bone</m></tl>, provided it is good.</ab>

<head>Molding with <m>paper</m></head>

<ab>Boil <add>over hot <m>ashes</m></add> some <m>cotton</m> in
<m>aquafortis</m> mixed with <m>sal ammoniac</m>, like
<m><la>aqua regia</la></m>, and the <m>cotton</m> will become very fine,
like powder. Temper it next it with <m>gummed water</m> &amp; you will mold
very delicately.</ab>

<head><pa>Almond trees</pa>, <pa>apricots</pa></head>

<ab>They come in quite straight if one grafts them. And all trees with
pitted fruit, like <pa><fr>pavis</fr></pa>,
<pa><fr>mericotons</fr></pa>, <pa><fr>alberge</fr></pa>,
<del><fr>vie</fr></del> <pa>apricots</pa> &amp;c, come in best 
shield grafted on an <pa>almond tree</pa>.</ab>

<head><m>Casting of lead</m> and <m>copper</m></head>

<ab><m>Lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> come out well in <m>white chalk</m> but
the softer it is the better. <m>The one from <pl>Champaigne</pl></m> fetches
the price that is set in <pl>Lyon</pl>. <m>Burnt &amp; calcined
<al>horse</al> bones</m> mold very neatly.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom" render="wide">



I believe that the <m>marrow from the horns of <al>oxen</al></m> or
<m><al>sheep</al></m>, that is to say, the <m>spongy bone</m> from the
inside, molds very neatly and is better than <m>bone</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="right-bottom">

Note that any <m>brittle metal comes out better than the fatty</m>. Also,
<m>lean sand</m> receives &amp; drinks it better than the
<m>dense one</m>.</ab>
