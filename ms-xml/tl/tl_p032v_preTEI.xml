<ab>They make two kinds of them in <pl>Toulouse</pl>, one to hang on the
<env>partition walls of rooms</env>, which they weave almost as fine as
the <m>straw</m> <del><fr>p</fr></del>hats worn by <pro>villagers</pro>. And
they make them in long bands, some the <ms>width of ten
<del><fr>b</fr></del> <m>straws</m></ms>, others of thirteen. And they
work on them mainly <ms><tmp>in summer</tmp></ms>. And <ms><tmp>in
winter</tmp></ms>, when they put it to use, they sew it. But beforehand,
they put it in <m>dye</m> and commonly make it in three colors, green,
red, and sometimes violet. The green one is made in a single 
<m><pa>pastel woad</pa> dye</m>, because green being made from yellow and blue, the
<m><pa>pastel woad</pa></m> discharging itself onto the <m>straw</m>,
which shows its dark yellow, one obtains bright green. For the red, they
use <m>alum</m> and <m><pa>brazilwood</pa></m>. For the violet, they use
<m><pa>pastel woad</pa></m> &amp; a little <m>copperas</m>, which
browns the blue with its black <m>tint</m>.</ab>

<ab>They do not have the invention for making a perfect red in a work
which one needs to reheat. Nonetheless, try the <m><df>red from <pl>Germany</pl></df></m>, 
which is <fr>rouge d’escaille</fr>. They make their common red with <m>sanguine</m>, 
<m>looking-glass tin</m>, <m>rocaille</m>,<comment rid="c_031v_02"/> 
<m>litharge</m> &amp; a little <m>iron scales</m>.<comment rid="c_032v_01"/> The
said red is applied on one side &amp; the other of the <m>glass</m> in order
that it has more color; if it were applied on one side only, it would be too
pale orange.</ab>

<ab>They buy <m>rosette</m> at xx <cn>lb</cn> a <ms>quintal</ms>,
which is harder to melt than <m>latten</m> because it is softer. For,
the softer the <df><m><add>great</add><comment rid="c_012v_01"/> metals</m></df>
<add><mark>#</mark></add><comment rid="c_112r_02"/> are, the <del>soft</del> more difficult they are
to melt. The <m>tin for bells</m>, which is <m>fine tin</m>
<del>is more</del> and which is brittle, is easier to melt than <m>lead</m>,
which is soft. <m>Latten made brittle by the <m>calamine</m></m> is
melted more quickly than <m>red copper</m>. The <m><fr>metal</fr>,<comment rid="c_016v_05"/> which is the
substance of bells</m>, mixed with <m>tin</m>, and very brittle, is soon
melted. The more <m>silver</m> is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is
why <m>solder</m> is made with it. In <pl>Germany</pl> they make very
light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of
<m>water</m>, but they are breakable. A <ms>quintal</ms> of
<del><fr>per</fr></del> <m>fine <pro>coppersmith</pro>’s rosette</m> is
sold for xxx or 40 <cn>lb</cn>. Another, which <pro>founders</pro> use,
is sold for xii or xv <cn>lb</cn>. The <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>metal</m>,
six <cn>lb</cn>. <del>Put in</del></ab>
