<head>Cross of the <pro>commanders of <pl>Malta</pl></pro></head>

<ab>This beautiful <m>rouge clair</m> which makes the field of
the white <m>enamel</m> cross is <del>blood</del> of fine tear of
<m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m> tempered with <m>eau-de-vie</m>
or else <m><pl>Indian</pl> <fr>laque platte</fr></m>, which in my opinion is made
in <pl>Flanders</pl>, tempered with <m>clear turpentine</m> &amp; tear
of <m>mastic</m> &amp; laid down on a <m>silver</m> leaf, not the kind
which the <pro>painters</pro> use, but a thicker kind, which is
burnished by <pro>those who make <m>gemstone foils</m></pro>
<del><fr>Av</fr></del> or by <pro>goldsmiths</pro>, &amp; that gives it
this beautiful brilliance.</ab></div>

<ab><m>Tin</m> should be pure for if there is any <m>lead</m>, it will
go up in <m>smoke</m> while melting. Mixed <m>tin</m> holds in the fire for a

<ab>If your <tl>retort</tl> is well <m><tl>luted</tl></m>, you ought not to surround it
with <tl><m>ashes</m></tl>, which would only get in the way of chasing
the <m>spirits</m> properly. But when, at the end, you give it violent
fire, surround it with chacoals which should be lit elsewhere beforehand,
as those in the <tl>furnace</tl> should be, in order that they do not
crackle &amp; do not make <m>smoke</m>. Put the said lit charcoals around the body
of the <tl>retort</tl>, &amp; not close to the neck, which does not need
to be heated as vigorously. The <tl>top grate</tl>, where you set your
<tl>retort</tl>, is sufficiently far, one <ms><fr>dour</fr></ms> or
<ms>half a <bp>foot</bp></ms>, from the <tl>bottom grate</tl> where the
charcoal is placed, for by doing this not as much of it is
wasted.</ab></div>
