<head>Softening <m>iron</m> and rendering it very soft</head>

<ab>Take <m>sublimate</m>, <m>quicklime</m>, <m>soap from
<pl>Venice</pl></m>, <m><al>horse</al> dung</m>, a little less
<m>sublimate</m> than the others. Wet all of this together like paste,
&amp; impaste the <m>iron</m> with it, &amp; envelop it in this
with some <tl><m>bad linen</m></tl>. Then make it reheat until it is
very red. Or leave <ms><tmp>overnight</tmp> in a good fire until the
<tmp>morning</tmp></ms>. It will be very soft for engraving on it well
whatever you want.</ab></div>

<m>electrum</m></head>

<ab>One calls it <m>gold from the <pl>Rhine</pl></m>, which one finds
in the <env>rivers</env>, and is <m>spangle gold</m>.
<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> from <pl>Germany</pl> wanted to refine it,
thinking to separate it from this whiteness, which they deemed to be
<m>silver</m>. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that
this whiteness is fixed, &amp; it does not lack color. This is
<df><m>electrum</m></df>, from which one can make cups
which will demonstrate <md>poison</md>.</ab></div>
