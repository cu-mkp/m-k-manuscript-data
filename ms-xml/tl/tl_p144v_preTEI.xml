that all things that have shells or that are hard or are not
malleable, like <al>snakes</al> &amp; <al>lizards</al>, want to be

Next, clean your <tl>half mold</tl> &amp; smooth it &amp; flatten, like
the others. But because it happens that because <del><fr>u</fr></del><comment rid="c_063v_02"/> of

halfway, two notches, like for other <tl>molds</tl>, and return your

stuff all around what is empty, up until the edge of the top shell, with

adapt the sides of these two <tl>molds</tl> smoothly, &amp; on each side
secure their joint, which can only just be perceived, with two
<tl>clamps</tl>, in order that when uncovering afterward the underneath
of the <al>turtle</al>, they are not undone. Next, uncover the side of
the belly &amp; of the throat, in the way that you uncover a
<al>crayfish</al>, which is the most difficult to mold of the little
beasts, which are molded in two halves.</ab>
