<ab>Because <pa>millet</pa> is by nature very dry,
<pro>harvesters</pro> beat it most often <tmp>at night <env>in the cool
&amp; by moonlight</env></tmp>. Which could not be done with another
<m>grain</m> that is wetter, for one <del>le</del> must let the
sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the <tmp>sun is
approaching midday</tmp>. Quickly after the <pa>millet</pa> is
cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats it &amp; makes it lean as
much as if the <pa>millet</pa> was still standing. The ground
where the <pa>millet</pa> has been sown diminishes much
in its fertility <del>&amp; c</del>, which one knows
<del>well</del> <tmp>at the next sowing</tmp> that one makes after that. But above
all the <m>grain</m> called

according to the common saying. <pa>Beans</pa>
improve &amp; correct the soil, provided that one lets the roots &amp; stems
rot in it.</ab>

<ab>They commonly have four books. The <fr>tyrant</fr>, which is a
formulary for <pro>apprentices</pro>, by which they can know how much
every item of merchandise costs &amp; <del><fr>co</fr></del>for how much
it should be sold. The second is the waste book, where they put down in
rough what they sell daily. The third is the sales book, where they
reduce to clean copy and put the retail account of what is contained in
the waste book. The fourth is the account book, which mentions the sale,
the balanced account, the bill &amp; the term of payment, &amp; to this one
