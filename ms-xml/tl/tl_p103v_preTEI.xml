<head><md>Enema</md></head>

<ab>

In order that the tube does not harm, for example children, or those who
<del><fr>se</fr></del> have <md>protruding or swollen hemorrhoidal
<bp>veins</bp></md>, one covers the end of the <tl>tube</tl> with a piece of
<m><al>chicken</al> gut</m> &amp; one folds it back over the end, &amp;
in this way, one gives the <md>enema</md>.</ab>

<head>Cast</head>

<ab>

<m>Tin</m> retracts when it is thick, thus it is best to cast it thin &amp;
to make two pieces out of one, then <m>solder</m> <add>them</add> if
need be. One uses a strong piece of <m>taffeta</m> to sieve the <m>fine
sand</m>, with which one first covers the medal to the <ms>thickness of a
<cn>teston</cn></ms>.</ab>

<head>For making colors run</head>

<ab>

Mix <m>vinegar</m> <del>with</del> a little with <m>bile</m>, &amp; put
it <del><fr>p</fr></del> into a <tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl>, &amp; if
you want to keep it for a <tmp>long time</tmp>, add some <m>salt</m> to it &amp; of
this, mix some of it among your colors &amp; that will make them
run.</ab>

<head><m><bp>Earwax</bp></m></head>

<ab>

If you take enough with the tip of an <tl><bp>ear</bp> picker</tl> &amp;
you pass it through the <m><bp>foam of urine</bp></m>, which is readily made by
those who have a <md><bp>headache</bp></md>, all the <m>foam</m> will dissipate.</ab>

<head><m>Enamels</m></head>

<ab>

For recognizing well their difference and their true color by
candlelight, you need to put your <tl>candle</tl> behind a
<tl><m>crystal</m> mirror</tl>, or a <tl><m>glass</m> globe or jar</tl>
full of <m>water</m>, because this light is like
<env>sunlight</env>.</ab>
