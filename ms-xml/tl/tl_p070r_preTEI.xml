<ab>When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the fumes of
the substance you are melting, because the cast is imprinted with the quality
<del><fr>e</fr></del>of<comment rid="c_070r_03"/> the <m>metal</m>, which afterward runs more easily in something that comes from it.</ab>

<ab> <m><al>Human</al> bones</m> are the best for casting once
calcined.</ab>

<ab>To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot
&amp; to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some
<m>iron scales</m>, either in powder or otherwise, <del><fr>E</fr></del> for
it heats <m>copper</m> a lot &amp; cleanses it of its <m>grease</m>. At the
end, when you want to cast, add some <m>saltpeter</m>, by folding your
additions in a <tl><m>paper</m></tl> in order that everyone may not know what you
mix in.</ab>

<ab><m><al>Sheep</al> foot bones</m> are even better than <m>those of <al>oxen</al>
foot</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Oil</m> &amp; <m>tallow</m> make it very porous, &amp;
    <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m>, &amp; <m>copper</m> alone.<comment rid="c_070r_02"/></ab>

<ab><m><fr>Cendr√©e</fr><comment rid="c_040v_01"/> earth</m> molds very neatly.</ab>

<ab><m>Ash</m> does not have enough body to withstand
<m>copper</m>.</ab>

<ab>It is better not to mix the <m>sands</m>, but to fill the <tl>frame</tl> with
one only.</ab>

<ab><m>Latten</m> is always fatty, &amp; does not mold neatly. One finds
that it comes out better alloyed with a <ms>quarter</ms> of
<m>copper</m>, but let it be cast very hot.</ab>

    <ab><m>Copper</m> comes out well with a bit of <m><fr>metal</fr></m>.<comment rid="c_016v_05"/> If you mix
in <m><fr>metal</fr></m> within <m>latten</m>, it will be more brittle &amp; more
troublesome.</ab>

<ab><m>Slightly coarser sand</m> has more body.</ab>

<ab><m>Sand from <del><fr>corp</fr></del> rock</m> is always better,
which seems like <m><fr>tuf</fr></m> in lumps, which has a beautiful
&amp; very fine grain, &amp; a little fatty. One <tl>pestles</tl> it, then one
dries it in a <tl>skillet</tl> on the fire, until it <del>is</del> no longer
<m>smokes</m>, then one passes it through a fine &amp; <tl>double sieve</tl>,
&amp; one molds with it.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

<m>Copper</m> or <m>latten</m> cannot come out well if the medal does
not sufficient thickness, &amp; if it does not have it, give it some
with <m>wax</m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Some cast through a hole made in the middle of the reverse side of the
medal.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Some, wanting to cast large works in <m>latten</m>, <del>in it</del>
mix in the <m>sand</m> some <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m> to give the <m>earth</m>
bond. But it makes it porous, and the work needs to be repaired.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">

One puts in <m>lead</m> for a large work to make it run, but not
<del>not<lb/>
for</del> in a small one because it would leave <m>filth</m> all around
the work.</ab>
