<ab>Your <m><tl>lute</tl></m> being dry, put, <ms><tmp>in the early
morning</tmp></ms>, your <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> in a <tl><fr>four à
vent</fr></tl>, &amp; at the beginning, give slow fire, as much for
reheating your <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> as for gently letting the fury of the
<m>saltpeter</m> pass. Then, invigorate little by little &amp; with
judgment the fire. And <del>there</del> leave in the full vigor of the fire your
substances for xii <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> or a <ms><tmp>natural
day</tmp></ms>. Make each time a good quantity of this substance, so as not to
do it often, because the <md>fumes, which are dangerous, could
hurt you</md>. And before working at it, take in the
<ms><tmp>morning</tmp></ms> <m>good buttered toast</m>, and hold the
said <m>butter</m>, or <m><pa>zedoary</pa></m>, or <m>gold coins</m>, in
your <bp>mouth</bp>, and <del><fr>ada</fr></del> cover your
<bp>face</bp> with a <tl>cloth</tl> from the <bp>eyes</bp> down. From
this mass, the crust will serve you <del>make run</del> <add>to
clear</add> <del>the great works <fr>d</fr></del> the <m>silver</m> <add>from
the <m>metallic</m> mass</add> <del>like <al>snakes</al> &amp; similar
things</del> <add>when it starts to melt</add>. <del>But</del> <add>And
then</add> the grain that will be at the bottom of the
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> should be put aside for <del>principally delicate
flowers and herbs</del> <add>putting a little in the <m>melted
silver</m> when you want to cast it</add> <del>However it is necessary
to always put a little of this grain in the <m>silver</m> when <del>you
want to cast</del> it is well melted and when you are ready to
cast</del>. Thus, do as you make <m>fine tin</m> on <m>copper</m>,
&amp; for <m>looking-glass tin</m> on <m>lead</m> and on <m>tin</m>.
And just as <m>looking-glass tin</m> sours <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>
too much if you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain
composed of the aforesaid substances would sour your <m>silver</m>
if <del><fr>l</fr></del><comment rid="c_123v_01"/> you were to put in too much <add>and obscure it</add>.
This aforesaid composition will suffice you for a <tmp>long time</tmp>, when
it has been <ms><tmp>for a whole day</tmp></ms> on a <del>gentle</del>
gentle fire at the beginning &amp; invigorated degree by degree until
the end. Then, having given it one load of charcoal, let it consume it
by itself, &amp; let your <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> cool. Next, break it. You
will find two hard slabs &amp; <po>cakes</po> in the
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>. The upper one is as if petrified <del>Once</del>,
composed of <m>salts, sublimated &amp; mixed together</m>. The lower one
is <m>metallic</m>, composed of <m>filings</m>, <m><la>æs
ustum</la></m> &amp; <m>antimony</m>, having the grain very small.
Pulverize the upper <po>cake</po>, made from <m>salts</m>, &amp;
put some to clear, &amp; clean the <m>silver</m>, and the <m>metallic
grain</m> will serve you to put in the <m>melted metal</m>.</ab>
