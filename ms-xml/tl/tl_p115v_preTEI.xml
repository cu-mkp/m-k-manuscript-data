<head>Cast of <m>tin</m></head>

<ab>If the plant or flower that you want to cast <del>in tin</del> is
delicate &amp; fine, it is necessary that the <m>tin</m> exceeds the
<m>lead</m> in the mixture, &amp; on the contrary, if it is thick, it is
necessary that the <m>lead</m> exceeds. Therefore, for the <del>mixture</del>
fine thing, put in some <m>fine tin</m>, not at all the <ms>quarter
part</ms> of <m>lead</m>. And make sure that your <tl>mold</tl> is
<ms>hottish, such that you can hold it in your
<tl><bp>hand</bp></tl></ms> when you want to cast. As for the
<m>alloyed tin</m>, the same as mentioned, it is necessary that it is
very hot &amp; almost red for casting, so that it penetrates. Otherwise,
having <add>to</add> run the length of the fine branches of
the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And do not forget to
mix in it a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>, which makes it run better
&amp; firms it up.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

In the <m>lead alloyed with tin</m>, or <m>tin alloyed with lead</m>,
you can put a little bit of <m><fr>metalline</fr></m>, &amp; it will seem
<m>silver</m>. But do not put too much, for this hardens the substance
&amp; sours it also, so that for a delicate thing like legs &amp;
similar things, it would not be appropriate.</ab>

<head>For giving venting to the <tl>mold</tl></head>

<ab>In addition to your vents, if your <del><fr>es</fr></del> plant is
very fine, you can pass a <tl>thread</tl> through the
<add><m>clay</m></add> circle, rather than casting with a
<tl>needle</tl>, &amp; make sure it passes through the plant. And with the
<tl>thread</tl> burning like the plant, a hole will remain which will
give air &amp; venting, to help clean.</ab>

<head>Reheating the <tl><fr>noyau</fr> molds</tl></head>

<ab>After your <tl>molds</tl> have their gate, vents &amp;
<tl>clamps</tl>, as is said, make at the end of the <tl>forge</tl>
<del>in</del>, or in some clean place, a surrounding of
<m>bricks</m>, and fill it with large half-lit charcoals. And place your
<tl>molds</tl> on top, and leave the charcoals thus to kindle by
themselves for a <ms><tmp>half hour</tmp></ms>, so that they heat little
by little and not all at once. Finally, as they will begin to become white,
beat <del>little by little</del> the thus half-lit large charcoals
on top &amp; blow with your <tl>little bellows</tl> until they are
warmed. And thus, little <add>by little</add>, invigorate the fire,
without haste, until your <tl>molds</tl> are quite red on the outside
&amp; the inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which
does not release well, &amp; if, for this reason, one needs to burn
<add>it</add> in the <tl>mold</tl>, &amp; when you look through the gate, &amp; through it, you see the <tl>molds</tl> are very red &amp; inflamed
inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if
you do not see this signal, increase &amp; continue the fire until it is
the case. If there is nothing in the <tl>mold</tl> that needs burning,
it will be enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is
for casting <m>tin</m>. They reheat better in a <tl>reverberatory
furnace</tl>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-top" render="wide">
<hr/>
Do not pull out<lb/>
your <tl>reheated molds</tl><lb/>
from the fire before they<lb/>
have cooled<lb/>
themselves, &amp; take care<lb/>
that the <env>wind or the
cold</env> does not hit them while very hot, for this would make them burst.<lb/>
One must not reheat them before they<lb/>
are dry and firmed up, for they would<lb/>
cast in a different way, and<lb/>
it is necessary beforehand to make<lb/>
gates &amp; vents<lb/>
