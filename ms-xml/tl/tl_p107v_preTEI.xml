<tl>Molds</tl> can only be used once because for
delicate things, like <pa>wormwood</pa> &amp; others, one needs to break
them, but before one <corr><del>them</del></corr> needs to dip them well into <m>water</m> in which
the twice reheated things dissolve easily. Otherwise, you would not be
able <del><fr>f</fr></del> to release your work without danger of
spoiling it.</ab></div>

cannot think of passing it finely through the <tl>sieve</tl>, for it is
so fat &amp; wooly that it would not pass through it. It is this, with
its small soft <del>which</del> &amp; thin filaments, which gives
binding to the <m>sand</m> in a much more excellent fashion than

<ab>When you want to mold hollow, it is necessary that the
