as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste &amp; that it is
not so easy to handle, as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is
cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws off big bubbles or
exhalations, in the middle &amp; around, as long as a
<ms><bp>finger</bp></ms>. Seeing it in this state, remove it from the
fire for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it
would be too much &amp; would not set as well. For, when it becomes red
&amp; overheats, it loses its strength &amp; spoils the <m>sand</m>. Leave it
to cool before mixing it within the other <m>sands</m>. And when it is cold,
mix and mold, for as soon as you will use it after its cooking, the
sooner it will set.</ab>

<head>Catching <al>lizards</al> and <al>snakes</al></head>

<ab>The <m>sand</m> mixture is of two <ms>parts</ms> of <m>plaster pulverized

it, the <m>sand</m> would not withstand it. This <m>sand</m>, thus composed, is proper

<ab>It is necessary that all <m>sand</m> with which you want to cast well,

<ab><m>Feather alum</m> is awkward to <tl>pestle</tl>, and it does not
