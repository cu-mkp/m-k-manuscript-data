<ab>If any <pro>artisans</pro> complain
that one discovers their craft secrets, and if the
<pn>goddesses of <pl>Eleusis</pl></pn><comment rid="c_001r_05"/>
complain, as they did to <pn>N. the

As the <al>hen</al> carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a
<env>house</env> for a crumb or a grain that she divides among her
<al>chicks</al>, thus one distributes to <pro>orphans</pro> that which
has been sought among the arts considered vile &amp; abject.</ab>

If the jealous<comment rid="c_166r_10"/> disapprove that these things are picked up &amp; taken
from others, reply that since <la>nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum
aut factum sit prius</la>,<comment rid="c_166r_06"/> &amp; that one
holds that all arts were invented <tmp>in the space of a thousand
years</tmp>, so that you do not think that you are able to invent
anything new but rather rediscover anew the books of <pn>Numa</pn>,<comment rid="c_166r_13"/>
buried <del>by</del> &amp; <tmp>long</tmp> unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to
publish them for those who do not know them; so that as the
<tmp>preceding day</tmp> is teacher for the <tmp>subsequent</tmp>,
thus you needed to learn from those who <tmp>preceded</tmp> you in order to teach
to those who come after. The <pl>Latins</pl> took from the

others from <pl>Tyana</pl> learned by their travels the disciplines
which they claimed to have invented in their country, &amp;c. Will <add>one</add>
not say the <pro>weaver</pro> has made a cloth or precious stuff, even
though he did not dye &amp; twist <del>&amp; <fr>præ</fr></del>, wind &amp; prepare the bobbins and
balls of thread? Will one say the <pro>mason</pro> has not made a
