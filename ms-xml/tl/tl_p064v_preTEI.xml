<head>Apprenticeship of the <pro>painter</pro></head>

<ab>First, one gives him an <m>egg</m> to do in which one has him make
half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the
parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two
&amp; three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the
<tl><m>charcoal</m></tl> by the end, &amp; also the <tl>paintbrush</tl>.
Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to <del><fr>p</fr></del> layer colors.</ab>

<ab>One also presents him with these strokes &amp; lines.</ab>

<ab><del><fr>C</fr></del>The<comment rid="c_064v_06"/> figure of the <m>egg</m> is the
main pattern for faces <add>and for bent bodies</add>, <del>&amp; the cross</del> as the cross is
the model for a straight &amp; whole figure.<comment rid="c_064v_01"/>
Without these strokes you will never do well.</ab>

<head>Softening</head>

<ab>To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but
rather layer them twice, if it is not <m><fr>azur dâ€™esmail</fr></m>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



All colors that have no body in <m>oil</m> have none in
<m>distemper</m>, <del>and</del> but in <m>distemper</m> they sink to
the bottom. <m>Distemper</m> colors want to be fatty, which is
recognized when they take hold on the <tl>palette</tl> once tempered in
<m>oil</m>.</ab>

<head>Straight lines</head>

<ab>You can use the <tl>ruler</tl>, but do not lay it flat on the panel,
but as if lifted off, &amp; resting on the edges of the panel. Otherwise
you would smudge everything, &amp; also you would not see the stroke
well.</ab>

<head><m>Distemper</m></head>

<ab><m>Distemper</m> colors need to be <add>kept</add> darker
<del><fr>pr</fr></del> while you temper them, <add>because they whiten
while drying</add>. But <m>oil</m> colors remain the same color.</ab>
