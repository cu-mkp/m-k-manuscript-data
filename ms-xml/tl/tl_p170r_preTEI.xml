<head>Cleaning closed <tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for when hot, they retain the <m>ash</m>. When cold, they are cleaned better. Take a <tl><m>thin wire of latten</m></tl> or a <tl><m>delicate straw</m></tl> to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the gate. Blow into it &amp; suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
thicken the tail with <m>wax</m>, then cut it,
