<wp>Large culverins</wp> <del>are</del> for battery <add>&amp; piercing</add>
are forty <ms>quintals</ms> &amp; eighteen <ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long.
Their ball, of the <ms><pro>King</pro>’s caliber</ms> &amp; for
battery, is 30 <ms>lb</ms> and thus lighter than that of the <wp>cannon</wp>. And
thus, it does not carry so much ammunition for fifteen <ms>lb</ms>
suffices for its charge. The <wp>cannon</wp> makes a bigger opening due to the
size of its ball, but the <wp>culverin</wp> hits more fiercely &amp; propels
faster, having greater force due to its length. At the breech it carries
the <ms>thickness of two of its balls &amp; <del><fr>es</fr></del>the<comment rid="c_018r_02"/> 
<del>three</del> <add>third</add> <del><fr>s</fr></del> part of a ball</ms>, at the front the
<ms>thickness of one ball &amp; two thirds</ms>. <wp>Culverins</wp> serve to
batter defenses from afar when one cannot easily make an approach, and
<wp>cannons</wp> approach more closely. They also serve to support the battery.
One needs fifteen or sixteen <al>horses</al> for moving it. They are
<del><fr>tout</fr></del> of the same alloy as the <wp>cannon</wp>, as are all
<wp>pieces</wp> <del>that exceed</del> <add>smaller than</add> average, for to
these, one adds a little more <m><fr>metal</fr></m><comment rid="c_016v_05"/> in order that the melt runs
better. And for two <ms>quintals</ms> of <m>rosette</m>, one
adds six twenties <ms>lb</ms> of <m><fr>metal</fr></m> for the <wp>smaller pieces</wp>.
<add>They shoot 8 or 9 hundred <ms>paces</ms> at point blank, &amp; up to
a thousand <ms>paces</ms> if the <m>powder</m> is strong, &amp;
half a <ms>league</ms> at range.</add></ab>

Some invented the loading of <wp>cannons</wp> with cartouches.</ab>

Some <del><fr>po</fr></del> do not put the <m>powder</m> in the <wp>cannon</wp>
all in one go but in two &amp; ramming each time, saying that each
ramming raises &amp; gives a further <ms><bp>thumb</bp>’s breadth</ms>. But this
is not certain for <wp>large pieces</wp> which are loaded with a lot of
<m>powder</m>.</ab>

<ab>

The <df><wp><fr>bastarde</fr></wp></df>, which is a <del><wp>culverin</wp></del>
<del>middle-sized</del><comment rid="c_018r_01"/> piece,
weighs thirty <ms>quintal</ms>s and its ball weighs <del>xx
<ms>lb</ms></del> <add>xv <ms>lb</ms></add> and carries as its charge x
or xii <ms>lb</ms> of <m>powder</m>. Its proportion is at the breech the
<ms>thickness of two of its balls &amp; <del><fr>es</fr></del><add>the</add>
th<del>ree</del><add>ird</add> part of of a ball</ms>. At the front, the
<ms>thickness of a ball &amp; two of three parts</ms>. <del><add>or</add></del>
They serve to batter defences of little importance such as
<env>gabions</env> and <env>garrets topped with a tower</env> &amp;
similar things. It is thirteen or xiiii <ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long like
the <wp>large cannon</wp>. Ten <al>horses</al> can move it. It accompanies well
the <wp>large culverin</wp> for point blank because it carries small
ammunition.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



Some give it the <ms>thickness of three balls at the breech &amp; at the
front of two balls</ms>.</ab>

<ab>

The <wp>bastard culverin</wp> weighs 35 <ms>quintal</ms>s &amp; is xxv
<ms><fr>pan</fr></ms>s long. It carries <ms>three balls at the breech &amp;
two in front</ms>. Its ball is like that of the <wp><fr>bastarde</fr> piece</wp>,
weighing xv <ms>lb</ms>. These are <wp>pleasure pieces</wp> which cannot be moved by
carriage, but are for <env>city</env> defences. Some make these xxvii or
xxviii <ms><fr>pan</fr></ms>s long, like the Cow of <pl>La
Rochelle</pl>. But to such <wp>pieces</wp> one gives reinforcement at the breech
as of three <ms>balls</ms>. At range, they can shoot around one <ms>league</ms>,
&amp; <ms>a half league</ms> at point blank. Its charge is like the
<fr>bastarde</fr>. And if one wants to fire at some <pro>cavalry</pro>
quite far off, one increases the <m>powder</m> a little. A tail of <m>smoke</m>
follows the ball which <del><fr>de</fr></del> guides your
sight to where the ball is going. This goes for the
<wp>cannon</wp> and for the <wp>culverin</wp>, and not for <wp>small pieces</wp>.</ab>
