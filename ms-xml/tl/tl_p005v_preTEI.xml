<ab>string &amp; will represent a <bp>nipple</bp> as large as a plate, and
<pro>women</pro> can see the <bp>secret places</bp> that they do not
want to show to <pro>surgeons</pro>. It casts the representation out of
itself, and if you <sn>touch</sn> <del><fr>le lieu</fr></del> the eye of
the representation with your <bp>finger</bp>, another <bp>finger</bp>
will come against yours.</ab>

<ab>You will make a light <tmp>at night</tmp> for someone quite far
away, if you place the <tl>concave mirror</tl> behind a <tl>candle</tl>
placed on the <tl><env>window</env></tl>. You will be able to read and write quite
far from the <tl>candle</tl> if you place it behind the <tl>candle</tl>
&amp; place <add>&amp; turn</add> the concavity toward you. If you put
the <tl>mirror</tl> <ms>at the end of a <tl>table</tl></ms> &amp; a
<tl>candle</tl> on it, it will represent two lights on the
<tl>table</tl> for you. To see what is happening on a <env>street</env>,
shutter the <env>window</env>, whereby the more of it you can shut the
better it will be. Make a hole at the lower one, as wide as your <ms><bp>little
finger</bp></ms>, perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
place a <tl>sheet of <m>paper</m></tl> on the <tl><env>window</env></tl>
&amp; let the <ms>middle of the <tl>sheet</tl></ms> be over the hole.
Pierce the <tl>sheet</tl> in the same place as the hole &amp; the same
size. After, place the concave face of the <tl>mirror</tl> toward the
hole, &amp; it will represent to you all those who pass by in the
<env>street</env> on the <tl>sheet of <m>paper</m></tl>. Similarly with
the <env>pierced door of a closed room</env>. You can make wavy ones
&amp; triangular ones, in the fashion that <pn>Ptolemy</pn><comment rid="c_005v_01"/> describes, &amp;
<pn>Archimedes</pn><comment rid="c_005v_02"/>. The concave one also sets fire to <m>straw</m> from
quite far away, and lights a <tl><m>candle</m></tl> with the <env>sun</env>. Also, 
it heats through the reverberation of fire.</ab>
