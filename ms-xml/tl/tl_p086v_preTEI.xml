higher than the molded thing, because usually the <m>sand</m>, being reheated,
swells <del>&amp; if the</del> <del>by this</del> in the middle,

that the <tl>mold</tl> &amp; the cast are well reheated. Cast also all

thin, put a <tl><m>card</m></tl> or two or three <ms>thicknesses of
<tl><m>paper</m></tl></ms> underneath, when you want to mold it. In
this way the <tl>mold</tl> will be lower than the cast. Cast also at the

thick &amp; where there will be less relief.</ab>

<ab>Since then, I have molded with <m>burnt bone</m>, <m>iron dross</m>
&amp; <m>burned felt</m>, thoroughly pulverized &amp; ground finely on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl> and well mixed together. I moistened them very
well with <m>beaten glair of egg</m>. And having covered the medal with it,
as in the others, then filled the <tl>frame</tl> with <m>sand from the
<env>mine</env></m>, I knocked moderately. I found it to be of very good
release &amp; molded very neatly. I let it sit an entire <ms><tmp>night</tmp></ms>. The <tmp>next morning</tmp>, I reheated
it little by little, over the course of seven or eight
<ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> (<emph>for if possible, no humidity ought to
remain</emph> in the <tl>frame</tl>). I cast twice in <m>copper</m>

turned out very beautiful, shiny &amp; <sn>sonorous</sn>, &amp; without a
crust, and my <m>sand</m> was not corrupted at all. Since then, I
have cast with it several casts of <m>soft lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>
that came out better &amp; more neatly than any other that I have ever
found.</ab>

<ab>When you mold, make certain lines around your <tl>mold</tl>, in the

way.</ab>
