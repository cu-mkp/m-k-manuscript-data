<ab>Make your seat of <m>starch</m> soaked in <m>water</m> &amp;
your <m>gold</m> will burnish very well. <m>Clear starch water</m>
layered on the <m>paper</m>, then dried, &amp; repeated in this manner 3
times, is a good layer for <m>burnished gold</m> on <m>simple paper</m>

<ab>Take a well chosen tear of it which shows off its transparent red.

it</del> And stop it well and so diligently that it does not vent,
otherwise it would be worth nothing. And leave it thus for <ms><tmp>a

more beautiful &amp; better it will be &amp; it will dissolve if it is
good, otherwise it will become like <m>wine lees</m>. When you want to use
it, make a small hole in the <tl>stopper of the bottle</tl> &amp; pour a

<ab>The <m>good kind of <al>dragon</al>’s blood</m> can be found in

I put it in <m>common eau-de-vie</m>, mixing in some
<m>aquafortis</m> to give it strength. At the beginning the
<m>water</m> took on a slight tint, but at the end there was only an
appearance of <m>tragacanth gum</m> with which I think they adulterate
the <m><al>dragon</al>’s blood</m>.</ab>

When it is applied on <m>burnished gold</m>, it is prone to break. For
this reason, some coat it with <m>turpentine varnish</m>. Cold delays
the action of the <m>water</m> and the extraction of the color. And for
this reason, one can keep it close to the fire.</ab></div>
