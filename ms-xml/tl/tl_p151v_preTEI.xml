<ab>however, do not remove it until you have completely repaired the
<al>turtle</al>, for you will use this <m>earth</m> as <m>cement</m> if
you need to embed something or repair with the <tl>small chisel</tl>. If
there is some flashing at the joints of the <tl>mold</tl>, you will remove
it, either with the <tl>burin</tl> called a
<df><tl><fr>chaple</fr></tl></df> or a <tl>very sharp penknife</tl>,
or with a <tl>small file</tl>, &amp; then with the <tl>small
chisel</tl>, always having the natural one, to do this better, in
front of you. You can curl on a <tl>file</tl> the point of a <tl>small
chisel</tl> which is not quenched to make something lumpy. For these
<del>two</del> <al>turtles</al> &amp; hollow things that
presuppose being large enough, cast your alloy of <ms>half</ms>
<m>lead</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms> <m>fine tin</m>. There is more work in
molding a <al>turtle</al> than for twelve <tl>molds</tl> of flowers. If
there is some <m><la>crocum</la></m> in your <m>sand</m>, there will not be
flashing, &amp; if, by some chance, there is some on the sides, it will be
thinner than <m>paper</m>, as long as your <tl>mold</tl> is tightened
well with a <tl>press</tl>.</ab></div>

<ab>One needs to make it between two quite <tl>sparkling hot <m>iron
plates</m></tl>, especially the lower one, which will be sloping, on
which you will put some <m><pa>wheat</pa></m>, quite even &amp; uniform.
And then you will place the other, all red, on top, &amp; you will press
it until you see the <m>black oil</m> drip well. Reiterate that until
you have enough of it. This <m>oil</m> dries immediately. It gives gold
color to <m>silvered</m> &amp; burnished things, augments the color of
<m>gilded</m> things, serves as a <m>varnish</m> on <m>iron</m> for
engraving<comment rid="c_004v_02"/> on it afterward, for varnishing <wp>sword guards</wp> tawny. And could
also serve <pro>makers of <m>gilded leather</m></pro> well.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">One needs to use it when it is newly
made. And for things to be molded, it must not be as thick as for
coloring.

<ab margin="left-middle">It is not for anointing hairy animals,
for it is too strong &amp; stiff, but it is good to give form to the
legs of a small animal, like a <al>fly</al> &amp; suchlike. It is also
excellent for coloring <m>false white stones</m>.</ab></div>
