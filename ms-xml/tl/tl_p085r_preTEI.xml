<ab>to rest on a <tl>very clean &amp; smooth table</tl>, &amp; since it
is desiccative, I knew it would dry out <del><fr>lor</fr></del>, which I
let it do in order to reduce it to powder &amp; to mold it with <m>sand</m>, broken up with my <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> &amp; the sharp edge of
a <tl>knife</tl>. I <m>oiled</m> my medal, because <m>oil</m> cleans it
without spoiling it. <del>And</del> And having dried it &amp; cleaned it
with a <tl><m>linen</m> cloth</tl> &amp; <tl>very small <m><al>hog</al> bristle</m> 
brushes</tl>, I once again lightly anointed it with <m>clear
<pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> &amp; gently passed a <tl><m>linen</m> cloth</tl>
over it so that it does not remain too anointed, and I noted that,
by this means, it would come out better in release, because the
<m>ceruse</m>, once moistened with <m>water of glair of egg</m>, would not
attach to the <m>oil</m>. This worked very well and I molded a medal of
high relief very neatly, without any sticking, which a lot of
good <m>sands</m>, such as <m>felt</m>, <m>burnt bone</m> &amp; <m>iron
dross</m>, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it &amp; my
<tl>mold</tl> became hard like <m>marble</m>, and by this I knew
that <m>sands</m> for molding high relief should be well moistened with some
<m>water</m>, which gives them body &amp; compactness, such as <m>glair</m>, 
<m>gummed water</m>, <del><fr>ea</fr></del> <m>wine boiled
with <pa>elm root</pa></m>, &amp;c; and lightly <m>oil</m> the medal, it
withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as
<m>glass</m>. But even <m>soft lead</m> &amp; <m>brittle tin</m>
<del><fr>v</fr></del> want to be cast very hot.</ab>

<ab>Since then I have realized that this <m>sand</m>, even though it is
excellent &amp; endures many castings &amp; molds very neatly, nevertheless is fatty and makes things porous. Thus, <m>soft lead</m> <del>and
the</del> does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a <m>lean
sand</m>, such as <m>pumice</m>, <m>scales</m> &amp; similar things to
give them body &amp; so that they release better. For <m>lean sands</m>
barely release well and yet they receive <m>metal</m> well.

One ought to moisten with <m>glair</m>, then mix it well. And once in
