<ab>When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it renders it up.
And if, after having eaten something, it is thus pressed
<tl><bp>underfoot</bp></tl>, this pains it greatly &amp; hurts it. If it
is wounded, it will not eat willingly.</ab></div>

<head><tl>Molds</tl></head>

<ab>There is nothing better for opening them up than to anoint them with
<m><pa>olive</pa> oil</m>, &amp; nothing else. And next, when you
want to unjoin them, soak them in <m>cold water</m>, which is the
secret. <del><fr>L</fr></del> And<comment rid="c_110v_04"/> you will see that the
<m>oil</m>, although it seems to be imbued, will detach itself, like
grease. <tl>Molds</tl> become stronger in <m>cold water</m>. And <m>hot
water</m> would dissolve them awkwardly, although once reheated, they
are more handleable &amp; easier to dissolve in the
<m>water</m>.</ab></div>

<head><m><pa>Wheat</pa> oil</m></head>

<ab>Is made on a <tl>blade of <m>iron</m> reddened in the fire</tl>. And
the <m>oil</m> drips off, which is appropriate for anointing the hair of
a <al>butterfly</al> or similar thing, for this <m>oil</m> is instantly
dry &amp; makes the remainder dry out. It is necessary that the hair or
down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, for being upright, it
would elevate the <m>sand</m> &amp; become porous.</ab>

If you want to mold
something delicate, like a <pa>pansy</pa>, some, to give it a little
thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with <m>butter</m>. But it
is best to anoint it with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, for it has no body,
&amp; does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the
flower firm.</ab></div>

<head>Cast of <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m></head>

<ab>Because <m>tin</m> wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal,
plant, or other thing for molding is <del><fr>espe</fr></del> thin &amp;
fine, do it so that there is more <m>tin</m>, much more than
<m>lead</m>, namely less than the <ms>fourth part <m>lead</m> for three
parts <m>tin</m></ms>. And still, one puts <m>lead</m> only to form an
alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong &amp;
thick, put a lot more <m>lead</m> in than <m>tin</m>. And in one &amp;
the other you can put a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>, but only a
little, with a little <m>rosin</m>, when you want to cast. <add>Since
then, when molding with <m>fine and new lead</m>, I put into one
<ms>lb</ms> two <ms>ounces</ms> of <m>fine tin</m>. And when molding
with <m>fine tin</m>, I put in two <ms>â„¥</ms> of <m>fine lead</m>
for one <ms>lb</ms>. I made plants &amp; <al>snakes</al> just like
nature.</add></ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

I cast <m>tin</m> almost red, and <m>lead</m> the same, which, however,
had not remained in the fire for too long, for it becomes brittle and
calcines.</ab>
