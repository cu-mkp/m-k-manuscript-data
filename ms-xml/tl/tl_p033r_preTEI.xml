<ab>This is a <tl>well-furbished knife</tl>, <tl>nailed</tl> through the
middle in such a way that it easily moves to one side &amp; the other
&amp; the side <del><ill/></del> A, as readily as the side B, is hidden 
inside its <tl>handle</tl> marked C. The two tenons you see at the tip of
the <tl>knife</tl> are for locking it on one side or the other against a
<tl>nail</tl> which is at the butt of the said <tl>handle</tl>, in order 
that, when one wants to press hard <add>on</add> something to
cut it, it does not come out from the <tl>handle</tl>. You may allow the
side marked B to cut for demonstration purposes, <add>but not
much</add>, but the side that is notched <del>A</del> and marked A must
not cut. <del>It</del> It is sufficient that it be furbished well. And
also the notch needs to be as thick as <ms>the back of a
<tl>knife</tl></ms> in order that it cannot cause <sn>pain</sn>. And you
will only show the part of the <tl>knife</tl> which is not notched, for
the side with the notch needs to be <del><fr>mar</fr></del> hidden
inside the <tl>handle</tl>. And when you want to cut the <bp>nose</bp>
or a <bp>finger</bp>, pretend to sharpen your <tl>knife</tl> on the
<bp>thigh</bp> and, while <del>while</del> doing this, turn the
<tl>knife</tl> deftly. &amp; the part with the notch, which you will
cover <del><fr>l</fr></del> with one <bp>finger</bp>, will come into
your <bp>hand</bp>, and you will place the notch, colored with
<m>brazilwood rosette</m> or <m><pa>black cherry</pa> juice</m>, upon
the <bp>nose</bp>.</ab>

The <pro>conjuror</pro> ought not to amuse himself by watching what he
is doing, but look at the <pro>spectators</pro> and give them plenty of
good hocus-pocus words so that they look at his <bp>face</bp> &amp; not
at his <bp>hands</bp>.</ab>
