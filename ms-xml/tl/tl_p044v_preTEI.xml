<ab>They are made at <pl>Coustance</pl> in <pl>Normandy</pl> with
<m><al>horse</al> tail hair</m> which they clean with <m>lye</m> because
they sort them with the <tl><bp>mouth</bp></tl> &amp; separate out short
&amp; broken ones. They do not make the <tl>reed</tl> longer than the
sieve, &amp; the reed is round. They attach to both edges of
the <tl>reed</tl> the <m>hair</m>, either black or white, according to
the work they want to make. And the weft is <corr><del>is</del></corr>
done over &amp; under as for making any other fabric. And passing a
<tl>small flat stick</tl> of ii or three <ms><bp>fingers</bp> wide</ms>
between, next they pass two <m>hairs</m> at each step of the pedal
and weave with three pedals. There are xvii<superscript>c</superscript><comment rid="c_044v_01"/>
<m>hairs</m> in the entire sieve. They sell them by the <ms>dozen</ms> &amp; each dozen
xxx <ms><cn>sous</cn></ms>. They bring them to <pl>Toulouse</pl> to
transport them afterward to <pl>Spain</pl>, and take <m>silk tammy</m>
in exchange for it.</ab></div>
