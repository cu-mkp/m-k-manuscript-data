<ab>Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of
<env>churches</env>, <del>in it</del> melt <del>one</del> for one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>tin</m> a half of <m>lead</m>, &amp;
cast in <m>stone</m>, &amp; if they want their work whiter, they put
<del><fr>p</fr></del> <ms>half</ms> <m>tin</m> and <ms>half</ms> <m>lead</m>, but
the first mixture is the best, &amp; does not become porous. One needs
to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others <m>smoke</m>
their <tl>molds</tl> with a <tl><m>resin candle</m></tl> to cast neatly. The
<m>antimony</m> makes the substance brittle &amp; breakable. The
<m>looking-glass tin</m> makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as
for <m>tin</m>, it works well <del>to the</del> with <m>pure lead</m>.
Those who make very neat <m>lead</m> casts, use <tl>puncheon</tl>.

<ab>They put into one <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, which renders the <m>tin</m>
thicker. There are two kinds of <m>tin</m>, one of them nearly like
<m>lead</m>, which runs better, the other brittle, which becomes
thicker. They cast in solid &amp; thick <tl><m>tin</m> molds</tl> or, to
do it more neatly, in <tl><m>copper</m> molds engraved with a
<tl>burin</tl>, or in <m>stone</m>, or in <m>earth</m></tl>. Since
<m>latten</m> scraps, mixed in, only render the <m>tin</m> more
breakable &amp; harder &amp; difficult to work with, they cast
<add>in</add> their very hot <tl>molds</tl> <del>&amp; almost <fr>roug</fr></del> &amp;
with very hot <m>tin</m>. They fumigate their <tl><m>tin</m> molds</tl> with

if it is not mixed with the other soft one. And without this,
it would become waste.</ab>
