<head>Molding hollow on one side and in relief on the other</head>

<ab>And for this effect, one casts a medal of <m>fine tin</m>, which is
harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves
it in one half of the <tl>frame</tl> &amp; presses it a little so that
it holds better. And next, you will cast in your <tl>frame</tl> some
<m>solder</m> described above, or another more meltable than <m>fine
tin</m>. And thus, the second medal will melt &amp; mold itself on the
first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix
some <m>lamp black</m> with <m>water</m> &amp;, with a
<tl>paintbrush</tl>, give a light coat of this to the medal, which
remains in the <tl>frame</tl>, &amp; leave to dry. Thus it will not
melt.</ab>

<ab>But if you have a medal of <m>copper</m> or <m>silver</m>, you can
leave it in the cast if you want to cast with <m>lead</m> or
<m>tin</m>. But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold
would make the <m>tin</m> contract.</ab>

<ab><m>Tin</m> wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.</ab>

<ab><emph><m>Soft <underline>tin</underline></m>, which</emph> is the best for the cast, is the
one that, once cast in <fr>grille</fr>,<comment rid="c_028v_05"/> is <del>burnished

been burnished. And does not have holes like the one that is brittle &amp;
that is not shiny as if burnished.</ab>

<ab><m>Potin</m>, being cast hot, runs &amp; flows like <m>tin</m>. But
the medal becomes whitish from this, and immediately casts out the

do.</ab>
