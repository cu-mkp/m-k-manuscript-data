<head>Cast of <m>wax</m> to represent an animal that one has not
got</head>

<ab>Take some <m>white wax</m>, which is more appropriate for this work
than anything else because it is firmer &amp; does not leave as much
<m>filth</m>, as much as you need to mold the animal that you propose,
&amp; no more, and <ms>half</ms> as much <m>charcoal, <tl>pestled</tl> &amp;
finely passed through a <tl><m>linen</m></tl> or a <tl>sleeve</tl></m>.
The <m>charcoal</m> gives color <add>and body</add> to the <m>wax</m>,
which would otherwise be transparent &amp; the features would not be
seen as well. Therefore, put your <m>wax</m> to melt in the charcoal fire. And when it will be well melted &amp; liquid, take, for a
<ms><tl>bowl with handles</tl></ms> full of <m>melted wax</m>, as much
<m>sulfur</m> <del><fr>la</fr></del> <ms>as a large
<pa>walnut</pa></ms>. Pulverize it, melt it over a slow fire, &amp; when
it is melted, do not leave it on the fire, because it will become
<add>too</add> hard, but take it away &amp; agitate it always with a
<tl>little stick</tl>, &amp; let it finish its bubbling, &amp; when it is as
liquid as <m>water</m>, throw it in the <m>wax</m> that you have removed
from the fire. And mix &amp; always stir the one &amp; the other, in
order that they mix well. Next, mix in, always stirring &amp; in several
goes, <m>the aforesaid pulverized charcoal</m> <corr><del>in several
goes</del></corr>. And as it will be well incorporated, take heed if
<sn>your <m>wax</m> has passed its high heat, which you will recognize
<ms>when it no longer <m>smokes</m></ms></sn>, <ms>when it makes large tracts
<del><add><fr>se</fr></add></del> <del>re</del>pulling at the
edges, &amp; motionless &amp; close <del>to</del> one to the other</ms>.
For, if you were to cast too hot, you could not separate your <m>wax</m>
from the <tl>mold</tl>, &amp; it would set in the cast. When it is in
this good state, stir it with a <tl>little stick</tl>, in order that
the <m>pulverized charcoal</m> is everywhere &amp; not placed
at the bottom. And in this way, cast in your <tl>mold</tl>, little by
little, &amp; not in one go, because the <m>wax</m>, by its
unctuousness, does not flow

This <m>black sulfured wax</m> is for modeling round figures that are
not for releasing and that one needs to burn in the <tl>mold <fr>Ã  noyau</fr></tl> 
before opening it, <del><fr>po</fr></del> like those
which have arms &amp; legs out front or entwined. And then this
<m>wax</m>, by means of <m>sulfur</m>, melts with very little heat and
exits without leaving any <m>filth</m>. If, by chance, the <m><tl>pestled</tl>
charcoal</m> remains there as <m>ash</m>, by opening the <tl>mold</tl>
&amp; blowing inside, it stays neat.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

To make <al>snakes</al> with <m>wax</m>, or another thing to fix on a
<tl>candle</tl>, one needs to cast with <m>modeling wax</m> of all
colors.</ab>
