<head>Loading an <wp>arquebus</wp></head>

<ab>You ought to have different charges according to the range that you
want to give to your <wp>arquebus</wp>, all of which should have a <tl>screw</tl>
on the end that fits in the <tl>nut</tl> of the <tl>ramrod</tl> of the
said <wp>arquebus</wp>. Thus, when you have put the <m>powder</m> in the charge,
which is in the <tl>nut</tl>, hold the <tl>ramrod</tl> upright. And
raising your <wp>arquebus</wp> up, insert the said <tl>ramrod</tl> until the
charge is at the bottom of the <wp>arquebus</wp>, then right the <wp>arquebus</wp>, the
mouth of the <wp>barrel</wp> up, and remove the <tl>little ramrod</tl>. Thus your
<m>powder</m> will be entirely in the breech without any of its grain or
dust attaching to the sides of the <wp>arquebus</wp>, which always has some <m>filth</m>
in the chamber. Thus it will not push back, and you will shoot more
true.</ab>

<head>For adjusting a crooked <wp>cannon</wp></head>

<ab>Take off the breech and place it on an <tl>smooth &amp; well-leveled
table</tl> and pass through the inside a <tl>very smooth string without
knots</tl>, on each end of which there should be a <tl><m>plumb</m></tl>
 hanging from each side. Then look into the <wp>barrel</wp> along the
<tl>string</tl>, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the
place where it does not touch &amp; hit with a <tl>hammer</tl> on the outside on
that side &amp; in the same place, &amp; thus it will be righted, &amp;
do thus all the way round.</ab>
