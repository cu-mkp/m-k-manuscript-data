<head>Face in <m>distemper</m></head>

<ab>Because colors in <m>distemper</m> dry promptly &amp; one would not
have leisure to perfect the shadows &amp; touches on the face, one wets
the reverse of the face which is on <m>canvas</m> with a wet
<tl>sponge</tl>. Then, with a small <tl>paintbrush</tl>, one makes
the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
areas. And with another <tl>paintbrush</tl>, one <add>re</add>does the shadows
by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
because they are made of <m>bistre</m>, which stains the <m>canvas</m>
like <m>rust</m>. The said <m>bistre</m> is good <del>with</del> for
making shadows in <m>distemper</m> <del>mix</del>, for in <m>oil</m> it
has no body &amp; would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in
the said <m>bistre</m>, for shadow, <m><fr>ocre de ru</fr></m> &amp; a <corr><del>a</del></corr>
little <m>sap green</m>. The best <m>bistre</m> is the greasy &amp;
shiny kind from the <env>fireplaces of large kitchens</env>. It is
difficult to grind &amp; <sn>screeches</sn> on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl>.</ab>

<head><m>Azure</m></head>

<ab><m><fr>Azur dâ€™esmail</fr></m> always wants to be cleaned, because the
<m>filth</m> that can be perceived in the <m>wash water</m> makes it die. One needs
to layer it two times, &amp; the first very thick, moving the
<tl>paintbrush</tl> by layering it first lengthwise then across.
<figure size="x-small" id="fig_p093v_1" link="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uVW0vtsV1Z0My9fGdhuY_VsqXbMSeCgo"/> It is better used on <m>canvas</m>, where it is imbibed
immediately, than on <m>wood</m>. <m>Varnish</m> returns it to its
vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To assay it,
<pro>painters</pro> bring their <tl>palette</tl> to the
<pro>grocers</pro>, &amp; temper &amp; alloy it with a little white
ground in <m>oil</m>, for in this way, the beautiful shows its
<fr>turquine</fr> vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
delicate is the best for working. It is made finer <del>working</del> by
washing it.</ab>

<head>Violet and <m>lake</m></head>

<ab>It is made of <m>azure</m> &amp; <m>lake</m>, which is also assayed
on the <tl>palette</tl> with white. The one is deemed beautiful that, on a <tl>polished knife</tl> or on <tl><m>glass</m></tl>, 
gives<del><fr>u</fr></del><comment rid="c_093v_01"/> a
clear <del>red</del> color of red rose, tending a little toward violet.
The one that is <del><fr>noi</fr></del> dark red is not as pleasant.</ab>
