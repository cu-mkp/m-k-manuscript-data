<ab>To cast in <m>gold</m>, <del>it <fr>f</fr></del> <m><la>crocum
ferri</la></m> is necessary, <add>&amp; more <m>feather alum</m> than in the following mixture. 
The <m>feather alum</m> mixture cannot corrupt anything. The <tl>mold</tl> needs
to be red, &amp; one needs to press it promptly with <tl><m>iron</m>
presses</tl>.</add></ab>

<ab>The <m>shell of <al>crabs</al> &amp; <al>crayfish</al></m> are
awkward to burn, &amp; there is a proper fashion of molding them.</ab>

<ab><al>Rats</al> &amp; <al>birds</al> can be molded, and the feet are
awkward to extract when burnt because they are small &amp; delicate.
The bodies are extracted more easily from the <tl>mold</tl>. The feet
are cast in many <del>times</del> pieces.</ab>
