<ab>To cast in <m>gold</m>, <del><fr>il f</fr></del> <m><la>crocum
ferri</la></m> is necessary, <add>&amp; more <m>feather alum</m> than in the following mixture. 
The <m>feather alum</m> mixture cannot corrupt anything. The <tl>mold</tl> needs
to be red, &amp; one needs to press it promptly with <tl><m>iron</m>
presses</tl>.</add></ab>

<ab>The <m>shell of <al>crabs</al> &amp; <al>crayfish</al></m> are
awkward to burn, &amp; there is a proper fashion of molding them.</ab>

<ab><al>Rats</al> &amp; <al>birds</al> can be molded, and the feet are
awkward to extract when burnt because they are small &amp; delicate.
The bodies are extracted more easily from the <tl>mold</tl>. The feet
are cast in many <del>times</del> pieces.</ab>

<m>Tiles</m> with which one covers <env>houses</env>, the hardest

are used to <del><fr>p</fr></del> mix in with the <m>sand</m>

them until they have been quite red for one or two

<emph>The hardest <m>plaster</m></emph>, as was said, is the best

you can. Being thus <del><fr>p</fr></del> fine, put it,

<tl>skillet</tl> over an open flame, &amp; as it begins to heat up, stir
it continuously, and heavy &amp; coarse as it is, it will become so light
&amp; so handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance
to <del>handling</del><add>stirring</add>, as if it were <m>water</m>.
Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy
&amp; dense, and that is the sign that it is cooked. <add>But do not reheat
it until your <m>brick</m> and <corr><del>feather</del></corr> <m>feather alum</m> are
reheated &amp; the <m>clay</m> circles are made. For it needs to be the

One ought not to reheat it until you want to mold. And to reheat it, put
it, as finely ground raw powder, in a <tl>cauldron</tl> on
<del>ash</del> a clear flame, &amp; do not make it either too strong nor
too violent. Always stir with a long <tl>stick</tl> to avoid the vapor,
turning it around the <tl>cauldron</tl> &amp; in the middle, in a figure
8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy <del>difficult</del> to
stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to
throw off some bubbles at the edge of the <tl>cauldron</tl>. And finally,
it will become like liquid &amp;, as it were, mealy &amp; like bran &amp; boiling in
the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it
has once again become heavy,
