Founders of small works  of
tin

They usually cast with solder, even the things that should
not come out empty, for the latter require fine &amp; soft tin,
which however would not release, &amp; would not come out empty if it
was mixed or had some looking-glass tin mix
in it, just like they put in a little of it in soft
tin. They engrave their works on stones of which are made the
sharpening stones or files of barbers, which are found in
great flakes near the mountains, &amp; resemble
slate. They are of three colors: reddish, which is not as
perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire
&amp; as,one dard of the color of dark
slate, the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they
imprint it on carton, as thick as one
finger, to serve as a pattern, then with a
little compass &amp; little matching iron fittings, they
engrave their figures, having first flattened their stones &amp;
worn down one against the other, they make their p
molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins
perfectly, because the stones render themselves even. Before
casting, they rub the mold with tallow, which has quickly
absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking fine powder of
quicklime in a linen, they pounce the mold while
beating with the linen on top, then blow a little on top
to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents, if
the work is largish. They make them in this manner, as you see
represented here. They pierce a hole in some place on the medal that is
least visible. And then with a borer they pierce the mold on
the side of the medal.









And if they want their work to stay pierced in any place, they drive in
a bit of cork at this place in the mold. And
the lead or tin will not attach to it. 



Make sure the pegs of your frame enter easily so
that in opening the frame will easily open without shifting anything,
and that your frames fit well together, &amp; the table
is quite even. 



Try to etch with distilled vinegar.




Try calcined oyster shells. They are said to be
excellent for molding.
