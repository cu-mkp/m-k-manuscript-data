<head>Putting to death the animal for molding</head>

<ab>You need to be careful not to wound it in taking it. And, having put
it in a <tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl> <del><fr>d</fr></del> with
<m>bran</m>, or in a <tl>barrel</tl> <del>full</del> half full of
<m>fresh &amp; damp earth</m>, if you want to store them or keep them a
<tmp>long time</tmp>, give them live <al>frogs</al> &amp; not dead ones
to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &amp;
grow thin, &amp; have long wrink<fr><del>aulx</del></fr>led skins. Thus the best would be to
mold it as soon as <del>after</del> possible
<del><fr>apre</fr></del> after it has been taken. But before, put it to
death in this way. Place it in a <tl>clean bottle or vessel</tl> so
that it would collect no dust. And put inside such a quantity of <m>good
vinegar</m> &amp; <m><bp>urine</bp></m> that it can be covered. And shake it
&amp; torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in <ms><tmp>an hour or a half</tmp></ms>. But if you are in a
hurry</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">

To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the <m>vinegar</m> and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
&amp; when piercing it, it would draw back &amp; spoil the mold.</ab>
