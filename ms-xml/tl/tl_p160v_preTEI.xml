<head>Molding a <bp>foot</bp> or <bp>hand</bp></head>

<ab>Mix <m>resin</m> among <m>wax</m>, &amp; having incorporated it
well, soften them in <m>hot water</m> or <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, &amp;
then make an imprint by pressing, &amp; next cast in <m>plaster</m>,

<head>Delicate work of <m>gold</m> or of <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>It can be done with <al>flies</al> by hand without casting, &amp;
the wings &amp; feet can be joined by <m>solder</m>, which is not able
to be done with delicate works of <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>, because
they would melt. And the work of <m>gold</m> can be
<m>enameled</m>.</ab>

<head>Catching <al>crayfish</al></head>

<ab>Attach to the tip of a <tl>stick</tl> some <m>liver or lung of a
<al>cow</al> or <al>sheep</al></m>, &amp; with a small <tl>string</tl>
you make a <tl>basket</tl> hang from the tip of the aforesaid
<tl>stick</tl>. Put in <env>water where <al>crayfish</al> eat</env>,
&amp; they will quickly come to accumulate on the flesh. Extract gently
from the <env>water</env>, &amp;; those who want to go back into the
<env>water</env> will fall into the <tl>basket</tl>.</ab>

<head>Catching <al>passerines</al></head>

<ab>If they sleep <env>in <m>straw</m></env>, like they usually do
<env>close to the house</env>, leave the closest window open &amp; put
in a <tl>lighted candle</tl>, but so that the <tl>candle</tl> is hidden
&amp; that its light only appears throughout the room &amp; through the
window, and all will enclose themselves in the room. But it is necessary
that the <env><tmp>night</tmp> be dark &amp; without
☾</env>.</ab>

<head>Catching <al>birds</al></head>

<ab><tmp>In winter</tmp>, when the <al>birds</al> have molted, skin them
&amp; fill them with <m>stuffing cloth</m> <del>&amp;</del>, <add>or
else</add> dry them in an <tl>oven</tl> <mark>#</mark>. Then arrange
them on the trees, &amp; have <pro>one who sings</pro>, &amp; you will
gather them &amp; catch many.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>

in an <tl>oven</tl> that is scarcely hot <del><tmp>In
winter</tmp></del>. <del>it</del><add>And</add> <tmp>in summer</tmp>
this is done because, before they would be dried, the <al>fly</al> would
get into their eyes <add>and make <al>worms</al></add>. <tmp>In
winter</tmp> they are prepared better &amp; dry by themselves.</ab>
