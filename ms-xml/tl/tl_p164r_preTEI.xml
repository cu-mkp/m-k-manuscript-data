<head>Gate</head>

<ab>

When you make the gate of some delicate animal, like a <al>snake</al>,
make it come from the side of the belly &amp; under the tail, for from
the side, there are only straight lines, which are a lot easier to
repair than the back, which is more visible &amp; more marked.</ab>

<head>Repairing flashing</head>

<ab>

Having gently removed it with the <tl>point of a <fr>chaple</fr> or
burin</tl>, scrape it with the <tl>side of the burin</tl>, or gently
with a <tl>small file</tl>, &amp; rub with <m><pa>willow</pa>
charcoal</m> &amp; <tl>little brushes</tl>. Make continuous the lines
disturbed by the flashing.</ab>

<head><m>Leady silver</m></head>

<ab>

It degrades a lot, because the <m>lead</m> which is mixed in works it
like in the <tl>cupel</tl>, and makes it jump in little balls at the
edges of the <tl>crucible</tl> &amp; on the <m>charcoal</m> which
covers it. It is also fatty, and thus it is good to melt all <m>coined
silver</m>, like <cn>reals</cn> &amp; others, &amp; to put it in ingots
before melting it for casting <al>lizards</al> &amp; animals, for it
comes out better. I molded some as neat as the principal,<comment rid="c_137r_03"/> such as a
<al>little viper</al> of <m>silver</m>, and I made the alloy out of 4
<m><ms><cn>reals</cn></ms></m>, of 20 <m><ms><cn>sous from
<pl>Spain</pl></cn></ms></m>, &amp; a coin of xx
<m><ms><cn>sous from <pl>France</pl></cn></ms></m>.</ab>

<head>Blowing</head>

<ab>

When you melt <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>gold</m>, do not blow strongly
&amp; with violence, because with the <m>charcoal</m>
consolidating, the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> would lower &amp;
<del>the silv</del> could fall over. But when your <tl>mold</tl> is
ready, at that moment, blow strongly to heat well the <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with
<tl>small bellows</tl>, especially <m>gold</m>, for this removes their
<m>fumes</m> &amp; softens them.<comment rid="c_015r_01"/></ab>
