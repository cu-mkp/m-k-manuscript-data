<ab>good &amp; proper for molding. For if it is coarse, pass it through a

fall down to the bottom of the first <tl>vessel</tl>, but the one which
will have come from the troubled <m>water</m>, set apart, having
settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough
bond, grind it quite dry on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, &amp; you will
render it impalpable, &amp; which will have bond like <m>chalk</m>.
Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it &amp; again will grind it &amp; mix it with <m>salts</m>, or <m>linen, <add>or</add> burnt

<ab>In <pl>Italy</pl>, those who are in the colder regions, like
<pl>Lombardy</pl>, make <tl>square wooden cases</tl>, a little larger at
the bottom than at the top, and  affix <tl>buckles</tl> on its
sides for transporting them with <tl>straps</tl>, as one carries gout
sufferers, because the wheels with which one could make them roll spoil
the pathways of the <env>gardens</env>. And <ms><tmp>every two
years</tmp></ms>, they do not forget to open the sides of the
<tl>cases</tl> for trimming &amp; dexterously cutting, with the soil,
the ends of the <pa>orange tree</pa>â€™s roots, because otherwise, as they
find the wood, they contract &amp; fold back on themselves &amp; dry at
the tips &amp; would make the tree die. But as they are trimmed, it
preserves for them new space <del><fr>cos</fr></del> for expanding,
without finding resistance from the wood that hinders them. And know
that, for this effect, it would be better to join the sides of the
<tl>cases</tl> with <tl>screws</tl> &amp; not with <tl>nails</tl>, in
order to not shake the <m>soil</m> when one opens them.</ab>
