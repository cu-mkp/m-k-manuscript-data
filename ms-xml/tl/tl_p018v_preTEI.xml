The average weighs 18 <ms>quintals</ms> &amp;
measures xii <ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long.
Its ball weighs eight or 9 <ms>lb</ms> &amp; its charge is six
<ms>pounds</ms> of <m>powder</m>. <del>And for</del> At the breech it
carries a <ms>thickness of three balls</ms>, &amp; in front, two. It is
more appropriate for the defense of a <env>city</env> than for battery.
However, one takes it sometimes either to break a <env>barricade</env>
or to support the battery after the <wp>cannons</wp> have fired, in order to
prevent the assailed from re-fortifying after the <wp>cannons</wp> have played or
fired. Four <al>horses</al> can draw it. It shoots eight or nine hundred 
<ms>paces</ms> at point-blank &amp; almost as much as the
<wp><fr>bastarde</fr></wp>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">



To <wp>cannons</wp> &amp; <wp>large pieces</wp> one gives<del><fr>n</fr></del> as much
<m>powder</m> as is the <ms>diameter of a ball &amp; a half</ms>, at
which point the <ms>escutcheon</ms><comment rid="c_018v_02"/> sits. To <wp>medium pieces</wp>, such as
<wp>field pieces</wp>, &amp; smaller ones, one gives them <m>powder</m> the
<ms>thickness of two balls</ms>. To the <wp>passe-volant</wp> &amp; other smaller
ones, one gives them <m>powder</m> the <ms>thickness of three
balls</ms>. In general, one charges all <wp>pieces</wp> <ms>up to the
escutcheon</ms>. One charges with the <tl>ladle</tl> all
<wp>pieces</wp> from the <wp>cannon</wp> to the <wp>piece</wp> of four <ms>quintals</ms>
<del><fr>de char</fr></del>, and one gives them two
<tl><ms>ladles</ms></tl> of <m><wp>cannon</wp> powder</m> or one &amp; a half
of <m><wp>arquebus powder</wp></m>. To smaller ones, one only gives one
<tl><ms>ladle</ms></tl>, &amp; those of one <ms>quintal</ms> are
charged with a small charge.</ab>

<ab>

The <wp>field piece</wp> weighs ten or twelve <ms>quintals</ms> &amp; is ten
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long or 12. Its ball weighs vi or vii <ms>lb</ms>
&amp; its charge is 4 <ms>lb</ms> of <m>powder</m>. <ms>At the breech it has
three balls &amp; two in front</ms>, as do all <wp>pieces</wp> that are smaller than
the average. One gives them more of a breech because one makes them
longer in proportion, and also because in a <env>house or
elsewhere</env> one fires them more frequently than the <wp>large pieces</wp>.
Their <ms>caliber</ms> is also small, which makes the breech <ms>3 balls
thick</ms>. They are used for following a camp promptly &amp; for the defense
of <env>cities</env> &amp; <env>houses</env>, putting them on the
<env>walls</env> or on a <env>tower</env>. One needs three <al>good
horses</al> for drawing it.</ab>

<ab>

The <wp>passe-volant</wp> weighs vi <ms>quintals</ms>, is eight or nine
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long. Its ball weighs two <ms>lb</ms>, &amp;, for
its charge, a <ms>lb</ms> &amp; a half of <m>powder</m>. <ms>At the breech
it has three balls &amp; two in the front</ms>. Two <al>horses</al> can move
it, for a single <al>horse</al> does not begin to move a <wp>piece</wp>. It is
used for the defense of <env>houses</env>, or for taking among the
<pro>infantry</pro> to break a rank of <pro>cavalry</pro>.</ab>

<ab>

The falconet weighs 4 <ms>quintals</ms>, is x
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms> long. Its ball weighs one <ms>lb</ms> &amp; a
quarter, its charge is half a <ms>lb</ms> of <m>powder</m>. <ms>At the
breech three balls</ms>, at the front, two. To move it, two <al>horses</al>,
although such <wp>pieces</wp> are hardly moved insofar as they only serve to
defend <env>houses</env>. The ones which are carted around either for
battery or for siege combat, are <wp>cannons</wp>, <wp>culverins</wp>, medium-sized
<wp><fr>bastardes</fr></wp> &amp; <wp>field</wp></ab>
