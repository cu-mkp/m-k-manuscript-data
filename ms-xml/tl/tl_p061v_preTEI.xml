<head><tl>Frames</tl> of the <pl>Germans</pl> </head>

<ab><pl>Germans</pl> who work in miniature make <tl>frames</tl> not of
<m>glass</m>, but of <m>canvas</m> anointed with <m>clear turpentine
varnish</m>, namely <ms>half</ms> <m>turpentine oil</m> &amp; <ms>almost
half</ms> <m>turpentine</m>, because this light, which is not as bright
as from <m>glass</m>, makes features appear larger to them. And when they want
to make something subtle like veins <del><fr>de</fr></del> &amp; similar
things, they use <tl>paintbrushes composed of two or three
<m><al>rat</al> whiskers</m></tl>.</ab>

<head><m><fr>Azur d’esmail</fr></m> in <m>oil</m></head>

<ab>One needs too choose the most <del>beautiful</del> delicate that
will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in
<m>oil</m>. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can
grind it well, not with <m>water</m> but with <m>oil</m>, &amp; grind it
thickly. Next lay it on your <tl>palette</tl> &amp; mix in a little
<m>turpentine</m>, but hardly any, to give it bond, and make it so that it is
thick like <m>butter</m> or <m>mortar</m>, &amp; then, with a <tl>fairly
large paintbrush</tl>, work it by always moving the
<tl>paintbrush</tl> back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch
across it in a tooth-like jagging with <del>the</del> the <tl>tip of the
paintbrush</tl>. The highlights will be made with
<del><fr>d</fr></del> the same thinned with <m>ceruse</m>,
which, giving it bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used
thus. It must be very thick, &amp; almost such that you are at pains to
spread it with the <tl>paintbrush</tl>. And it is all the better
if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it
is very subtle &amp; thin without being ground, and does not run.</ab>

<m>Azure</m> wants to be layered neatly, which is why
<del><fr>quan</fr></del> it always dies somewhat when, to mend an old panel,
one layers it on old, already tarnished <m>azure</m>. In such
matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer &amp; apply imprimatura again,
then put down the <m>azure</m>. It is almost thus for other colors.
Also, <m>azure</m> ground with <m>oil</m> always remains shiny, which is
not a good sign for <m>azure</m>, for this makes it die.</ab>
