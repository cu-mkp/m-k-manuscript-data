instead of fine turpentine. And you can put into two
lb of toucommon turpentine one lb
of fine turpentine oil &amp; do everything as with the other one. This one

This vessel is for making large quantities of
turpentine oil, that is to say a bucket an
hour, and no matter which turpentine it may be,
whether fine or crude. One needs to give, as you know, a little
fire at the beginning and always keep cold water in the cooler
on the top. The lb is sold at xii sous, &amp;
at the bottom of the vessel remains the colophony, or
pix graeca. In this vessel, eau-de-vie is also made well,
and there is no need to distill it again. You
do not need a oven for this copper vessel, but
only charcoal around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is
round, you will place it on a trivet.



 It is better to heat the varnish a little bit, rather than to
put it out in the sun, because this makes the panel
warp.



 Some say it is not good to distil in this copper
vessel because it makes things green. However, when tinned, it is
good.





For varnishing

Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because it
is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the wood like that
of spike lavender &amp; sandarac. Also, that of spike
lavender does not require any glue on iron &amp;
similar things that do not absorb. But on wood &amp; on colors
which have do not have gum or 
distemper glue, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
hide glue &amp; to let it dry &amp; to
varnish.
