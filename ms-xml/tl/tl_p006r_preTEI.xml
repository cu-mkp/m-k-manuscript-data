For laying down and seating burnished gold and giving red
or green or blue



Ceruse &amp; lead white is not appropriate for polished
white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for
or mat which is made with oil, mixing it with yellow
ocher &amp; mine po &amp; tempering
all of it with oil. And this or mat thus applied keeps
in the rain like gilded lead work &amp; similar things.
Therefore for burnished gold take good chalk, quite white,
well ground, &amp; tempered with distemper glue, &amp; make
four layers of it, one after the other, on the wood. And once the
last is dry, rub it with prele, which is a
plant otherwise called horsetail, to render it well
polished. Next take fine boli armeni &amp;
sanguine, as much of one as of the other, also lamb
tallow the size of a bean or a
pea depending on the quantity of bole, and a
little willow charcoal, or as much as the
tallow, &amp; half a walnut shell full of
half-burned saffron. Some put in a little candy
sugar. Grind all together with water, &amp; apply it without
gum or glue, &amp; let it dry, &amp; rub the place that
you want to gild with a piece of white cloth to better
smooth it, &amp; when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that
the gold will be carried well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean
paintbrush soaked in clear water the place that
you want to gild &amp; immediately apply the gold, which you will
burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in rouge clair
&amp; glaze with it de, grind Venice
 laque platte on marble with
walnut or linseed oil. Once ground, mix
turpentine or spike lavender varnish &amp; apply on the
gold with the paintbrush.
Brazilwood &amp; laque ronde die. For
green, temper verdigris with walnut or
linseed oil &amp; grind it, next mix in turpentine varnish
and not spike lavender varnish, which is not suitable for
verdigris. If you want to glaze with azure, it needs to be
set on burnished silver and take azur dâ€™esmail,
&amp;, without grinding, temper it with turpentine varnish &amp;
apply it.
