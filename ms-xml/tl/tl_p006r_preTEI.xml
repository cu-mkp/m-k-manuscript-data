<head>For laying down and seating <m>burnished gold</m> and giving red
or green or blue</head>

<ab>

<m>Ceruse</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m> is not appropriate for polished
white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for
<m><fr>or mat</fr></m> which is made with <m>oil</m>, mixing it with yellow
<m>ocher</m> &amp; <m>mine</m> <del><fr>p</fr>o</del> &amp; tempering
all of it with <m>oil</m>. And this <m><fr>or mat</fr></m> thus applied keeps
<env>in the rain</env> like <m>gilded lead work</m> &amp; similar things.
Therefore for <m>burnished gold</m> take <m>good chalk, quite white,
well ground</m>, &amp; tempered with <m>distemper glue</m>, &amp; make
four layers of it, one after the other, on the <m>wood</m>. And once the
last is dry, rub it with <tl><m><pa><fr>prele</fr></pa></m></tl>, which is a
plant otherwise called <tl><m><pa>horsetail</pa></m></tl>, to render it well
polished. Next take <m>fine <la>boli <pl>armeni</pl></la></m><comment rid="c_006r_01"/> &amp;
<m>sanguine</m>, as much of one as of the other, also <m><al>lamb
</al>tallow</m> the size of a <m><pa>bean</pa></m> or a
<m><pa>pea</pa></m> depending on the quantity of <m>bole</m>, and a
little <m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, or as much as the
<m>tallow</m>, &amp; <ms>half a <pa>walnut</pa> shell</ms> full of
half-burned <m><pa>saffron</pa></m>. Some put in a little <m>candy
sugar</m>. Grind all together with <m>water</m>, &amp; apply it without
<m>gum</m> or <m>glue</m>, &amp; let it dry, &amp; rub the place that
you want to gild with a piece of white <tl>cloth</tl> to better
smooth it, &amp; when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that
the <m>gold</m> will be carried well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean
<tl>paintbrush</tl> soaked in <m>clear water</m> the place that
you want to gild &amp; immediately apply the <m>gold</m>, which you will
burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in <m>rouge clair</m>
&amp; glaze with it <del><fr>de</fr></del>, grind <m><pl>Venice
</pl> <fr>laque platte</fr></m><comment rid="c_039v_02"/> on <tl><m>marble</m></tl> with
<m><pa>walnut</pa> or <pa>linseed</pa> oil</m>. Once ground, mix
<m>turpentine or <pa>spike lavender</pa> varnish</m> &amp; apply on the
<m>gold</m> with the <tl>paintbrush</tl>.
<m><pa>Brazilwood</pa></m> &amp; <m><fr>laque ronde</fr></m><comment rid="c_006r_02"/> die. For
green, temper <m>verdigris</m> with <m><pa>walnut</pa> or
<pa>linseed</pa> oil</m> &amp; grind it, next mix in <m>turpentine varnish
and not <pa>spike lavender</pa> varnish</m>, which is not suitable for
<m>verdigris</m>. If you want to glaze with <m>azure</m>, it needs to be
set on <m>burnished silver</m> and take <m><fr>azur d'esmail</fr></m>,
&amp;, without grinding, temper it with <m>turpentine varnish</m> &amp;
apply it.
