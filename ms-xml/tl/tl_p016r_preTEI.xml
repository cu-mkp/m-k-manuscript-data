<head>Founding of <m>soft iron</m></head>

<ab render="wide">Most <pro>people</pro> consider that <m>iron</m>, once melted,
cannot be melted again because they only heat it in <tl>small
forges</tl>, in which it only becomes red-hot. <pro>Alchemists</pro>
undertake to melt it mixed with <m>realgar</m> or <m>lead</m> or <m>orpiment</m>. 
But without all that, some have found a manner of
<del>the</del> melting not only <m>brittle iron</m>, such as the kind used
for <tl><m>iron</m> pots</tl>, but also <m>soft iron</m> such
as <del><fr>d</fr></del> that of pigs &amp; ingots, which is the most
difficult kind. And to this effect they make a <tl>furnace</tl> in this
manner which has a width of one <ms><fr>pan</fr> &amp; a half</ms> &amp;
<del>one <ms><fr>pan</fr> &amp; a half </ms>of</del> a depth of two
<ms><fr>pans</fr></ms>. And the <tl>blast-pipe</tl>, which is the barrel
<del>through</del> marked A through which the <tl>bellowsâ€™ pipes</tl> enter, has
to<comment rid="c_016r_01"/> be placed in the middle of the height of the <tl>furnace</tl> such
that there is one <ms><fr>pan</fr></ms> of the mouth of the
<tl>furnace</tl> above the <tl>blast-pipe</tl> &amp; one
<ms><fr>pan</fr></ms> underneath.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Each <ms><fr>pan</fr></ms> of the mouth of the <tl>square furnace</tl>
contains <ms>one &amp; a half quintal</ms>, &amp; the
<ms><fr>pan</fr></ms> of the <tl>round furnace</tl> holds two
<ms>quintals</ms>.</ab>

<ab margin="right-middle">

The <pro>miners</pro>, to make the <m>iron</m> run, put at the mouth of
the melt, two or three <ms><bp>handfuls</bp></ms> of
<m><pa>wallwort</pa></m> when they want to make the melt run, and
this renders the <m>iron</m> wonderfully ductile and flowing.</ab>

<ab render="wide">It is also necessary that the <tl>blast-pipe</tl> enters through to the
middle of the mouth of the <tl>furnace</tl>, which is a principal part of
the secret because the wind will hit the edge &amp; the wall which makes
up the belly of the <tl>furnace</tl> &amp; by such means, it spreads
equally everywhere &amp; above, like the flame in a <tl>reverberatory
furnace</tl>, &amp; by such means heats much more; for if the wind were
to hit directly from above, the substance which is melted or ready to be
melted, it would cool it down &amp; prevent it from running &amp;
melting. It is also necessary for the <tl>bellows</tl> to be driven by the
leaping &amp; running of <m>water</m> as in <tl>forges</tl>, because in
this manner, the <tl>bellows</tl> run with measure &amp; compass &amp; with great
speed, which the strength of <pro>workers</pro> could <del><fr>f</fr></del> not
do. Therefore one raises the wall as you see &amp; the <tl>furnace</tl>
on the surface of the ground at the edge of which you make a channel as
with other founding, to put the <tl>molds</tl> of that which you want to
cast &amp; to do this, you unstop the opening that you had made at the
bottom of the <tl>furnace</tl> to make the melted substance run. You
will be able to melt two <ms>quintals</ms> of <m>iron</m> each time and
to do this, you will choose the <tl><ms>biggest</ms> charcoal</tl> you
can find &amp; put a load of it at the bottom, on the plane and surface
of the <tl>furnace</tl> &amp; with the bottom piling up <del>as if</del>
to a point, up to the top of the wall

Some make a <tl>mold</tl> of the caliber of the piece, &amp; temper it,
then beat a <m>soft iron</m> piece cut to size, &amp; when
this piece is very red, they beat it into the <tl>mold</tl> &amp; round
it off with a <tl>large file</tl>, considering these balls to be
stronger than the melted ones which, being brittle, are more subject to
breaking.</ab>
