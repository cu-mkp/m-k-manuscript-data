<head>Method of casting in <m>bronze</m></head>

<ab><m>Latten of potin</m> <del><fr>cor</fr></del>, which is
the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many
people, than <m>fine latten of pots</m>, just like all <m>fine
latten</m> molds neater than <m>red copper</m>. If you want to cast
something fine &amp; thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as
possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot
enough when it <m>smokes</m> a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat
well, place your <tl>crucible</tl> as low as possible &amp; at the very
bottom of the <tl>forge</tl>, so that the <tl>bellows</tl>
<del><fr>fra</fr></del> beat on the middle of the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, for
in this way it is better than on the <tl>grate</tl> on which one usually
puts the <tl>crucible</tl>, under which the <tl>bellows</tl> beat. It is
true that the <tl>crucible</tl> risks more danger breaking, but you can
<m><tl>lute</tl></m> it as you know <pro>founders</pro> do. And also, one ought
to maintain the <m>charcoal</m> between the <tl>bellows</tl> &amp; the
<tl>crucible</tl>. Also take heed to cast all at once &amp; not in
increments &amp; drop by drop, which would stop &amp; plug up the
conduit of the substance. And if you were to make in the cast a
trough to feed the medal, it would be even better. And in order
that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with
a <tl><m>wood</m> stick</tl>, for <m>iron</m> only makes it brittle.

The <m>copper</m> substance is found to be good for casting, when once
broken it makes the grain long &amp; not short, for it demonstrates that
it is soft. It is <ms>half</ms> <m>fine latten</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms>
<m>red copper</m>. This long grain is called long stalk.</ab>
