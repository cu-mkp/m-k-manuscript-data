<head>Grafting</head>

<ab>With any tree that has coarser marrow, <add>the graft</add> is awkward
to <del>be</del> cut <add>well</add>, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, &amp; if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the <pa>vine</pa>, from all
<pa>peaches</pa> &amp; <pa>apricots</pa>.</ab>

<ab><pa>Apricot trees</pa> have a very thin bark, &amp; thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of <pa>prune trees</pa> &amp; <pa>almond trees</pa>.</ab>

<ab>The grafts scarcely <del><ill/></del> take if the cut of the tree is
wet. One needs then to graft in <env><fr>serain</fr> &amp; mild
weather, &amp; not too cold &amp; windy</env>.</ab>

<ab>Old wood that one leaves to the graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made &amp; of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, &amp; if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood <del>than the young</del> better, because it is harder than
the young. <comment rid="c_091r_02"/>But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile &amp; short &amp; slow to
grow.</ab></div>

<head>Molding with <tl><m><al>cuttlefish</al> bone</m></tl></head>

<ab>Guard against keeping them <env>in a humid place</env>, for they are
very prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the <m>bone</m>
in two, then even it out with a <tl>knife</tl>. And on a <tl>hooked
<m>roof tile</m></tl>, quite dry &amp; quite smoothed &amp; covered with
<m>pulverized <pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, rub &amp; smooth the two
halves of the <tl><m>bones</m></tl>. Thus they imbibe this <m><pa>willow</pa>
charcoal</m>, which makes them release well &amp; guards against removing
anything. Then, on a <tl><df>counter bone</df></tl>, that is to say a piece of
<m>brick</m> evened to the size of your <tl><m>bone</m></tl>, place
your medal, &amp; then on this one, place the <tl><m>bone</m></tl>,
&amp; press well with some other piece of the same size on the top. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, pounce on top with
<m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m> &amp; blow lightly, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole <tl><m>bones</m></tl>. All cast work is brittle &amp; subject to
breaking, because the <m>metal</m> expands when cast, &amp; retracts
&amp; condenses under the <tl>hammer</tl>. That is why one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a <tl>chisel</tl>, &amp; in this way the
<m>metal</m> retracts. Let it thus <fr>escrouir</fr>. If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the <tl>mold</tl> &amp; hollow it
with a <tl>penknife</tl> to make way for the medal, &amp; then
mold. And if the medal has two sides</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">Before casting, heat the
<tl><m>bones</m></tl> in order to make them lose only the coldness &amp;
moisture.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">When the <m>lead</m> gets too hot, it
calcines.</ab>
