<ab>But <del>because</del> the <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> do not press
evenly, for <del>one</del> if you press on the edges, the middle will
remain hollow. Begin, therefore, by the middle, &amp; then follow the
edges. But to make it better, put on the medal something flat &amp;
smooth, or some <tl>large square file <del><fr>e</fr></del></tl>, &amp; press with
this, for you will press equally, sometimes <del>after <fr>l</fr></del>
with your <tl><bp>knee</bp></tl>, other times with your
<tl><bp>foot</bp></tl> with your shoe taken off, &amp; make the
<tl><m>bone</m></tl> be on top; thus you <del><fr>lâ€™emprand</fr></del>
will imprint it without breaking it. If, on the first go, it is not
molded well, return to it several times. Then, repair &amp; smooth on the
sides your <del><fr>d</fr></del> halves of molded <tl><m>bone</m></tl>.
<del>&amp;</del><comment rid="c_145v_01"/> And to cut it well, always begin coming from the
softest part to the scales. And if your medal does not come out by
itself, scratch the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> from the back, which is rugged,
and it will release. When you want to cast, secure &amp; join your two
<tl><m>bones</m></tl> with some <tl>small points of <m>wood</m></tl>,
&amp;c. But to mold very neatly, there is only our <m>sand</m>.</ab>

<ab>One does not need <tl><m>clay</m> slabs</tl>, because plants or
flowers are not laid on top but as in air, without touching on any side
anything. <del>&amp;</del><comment rid="c_145v_02"/> Only the <del><fr>es</fr></del>
<tl>circle</tl> &amp; <tl>contour</tl> are needed, which should be
higher than for <tl>flat molds</tl>. And thus, take heed to make it
strong and thick according to the size that you want, otherwise it would
burst, the <m>sand</m> being inside. Secure it &amp; fortify it well by the
foot, &amp; join well all the joints. Then, take your flower, well joined
&amp; securely adapted to the end <del>of
<fr>cir</fr></del> of the gate of <m>wax</m>, which should not be rough
but rather smooth, in order that it can release well.</ab></div>
