<ab> As I saw that they did not <m>smoke</m> anymore &amp; that, scratching
the back &amp; the front of the cast &amp; having found that they are
rough &amp; firm &amp; hard on one side and the other, which is a good
sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some <m>fine
tin</m> <del><fr>f</fr></del>, one <ms>lb</ms>, &amp; one <ms>ounce</ms>
of <m>lead, fine &amp; new</m>. I melted it in a <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> until
it was, <del>a little</del> as it were, a little red. Being in this way quite hot
<del>I <m>smoked</m> &amp; not <fr>p</fr></del> &amp; being ready to cast, &amp; not
before, I <m>smoked</m> with the <m>smoke of a <tl>tallow candle</tl></m> all
sides of my <tl>frames</tl> &amp; imprint &amp; cast &amp; everything.
I set my <tl>frame</tl>, well joined, in the <tl>press</tl>. I drew my
<tl>crucible</tl> from the fire. I left it a little so that
the redness at the bottom of the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> could <del>pass</del> <add>die
down</add>. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three
<ms>grains</ms> of something like <m>pitch rosin</m>, &amp; at the same time the
<ms>size of a <pa>bean</pa></ms> of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, &amp; I
mixed, &amp; stirred the <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> a little, and I cast. And the
medal came out as neat as the principal.<comment rid="c_137r_03"/> I <m>smoked</m> it with the
<tl><m>candle</m></tl> &amp; cleaned it with <tl>small
brushes</tl>.</ab>

<ab margin="left-bottom">

Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
lower, will come out better &amp; make the cast longish. And when you
cast several medals in a <tl>large frame</tl>, they will come out
better.</ab>

<head>Advice about the above</head>

<ab><df><m>Good tin</m></df> is that which is hard as <m>silver</m>
&amp; soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
<m>tin</m> &amp; alloyed as is said.</ab>

<ab><m>Looking-glass tin</m> must not be <del><m>smoked</m></del> mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.</ab>

<ab> Nor must the forms be <m>smoked</m> until then.</ab>

<ab> If the <m>sand</m> shrinks in the <tl>frame</tl>, this means that it must
be reheated &amp; reddened on the fire.</ab>

<ab>Good <m>sand</m>, when moistened, does not stick at all to the
<tl><bp>hand</bp></tl> when pressed.</ab>

<ab>The <m>perfect sand for the <tl>frame</tl></m> is
<m><fr>aspalt</fr></m>, which is found in
<pl>Germany</pl>, which is soft as <m>flour</m> <del>&amp; <fr>presq</fr></del>
when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.</ab>

<ab>

<emph><la>Nota</la></emph><comment rid="c_119r_01"/> that the cast must be thin &amp; hardly thick
in order that it does not overtax the material, and must not
exceed the <ms>thickness of <del><fr>un</fr></del><commment rid="c_024r_05"/> the width of a <m>grain of
<pa>wheat</pa></m></ms>; likewise for <m>tin</m>, which wants to be cast
very thinly. For <m>lead</m>, a little thicker. There is no need to make
the vents very large &amp; deep either.</ab>

<ab>
For <tl>frames</tl>, the <m>sand that you use for the <fr>noyau</fr></m>, of the
aforesaid composition, is excellent. But in washing, crushing &amp;
reheating it several times, it must be corrupt from its nature &amp; no longer fit to make a hold &amp; to mold <fr>en noyau</fr>.</ab>
