<ab>It is made from <m>white wax</m>, which is harder than the other,

<ab>Because the feet of these, which are very small, are very delicate,

will leave a <del><fr>g</fr></del><comment rid="c_133r_02"/> little gate for the said feet. And
should the bottom of these come off in one piece, you can repair it well. And
the scales from the top of the toes will come out well.</ab>

set the stance, especially that of the head. But the head being pierced,
there remains around the hole some moisture and a little exudation,
which hinders the <m>sand</m> from covering the <tl>point</tl> &amp; there
always remains some little opening <del><fr>g</fr></del>. But to avoid
this, you can plant <add>in the slab of earth</add> an

when you come to uncover the belly &amp; the throat to make the second
