<ab>It is made from <m>white wax</m>, which is harder than the other,

it becomes as hard as you fancy <del><fr>u</fr></del>, adding to it a
<ms>drop</ms> of <m>turpentine</m> to bind it. Next, mix in whatever
color you want. This is the <m>wax</m> <pro>goldsmiths</pro> use for

<ab>Because the feet of these, which are very small, are very delicate,
when you have molded the top and <del><fr>d</fr></del> you uncover the belly
&amp; the bottom of the feet, cover them lightly with <m>wax</m> &amp;
then cast the second <tl>mold</tl>. And the <m>wax</m> being removed, it
will leave a <del><fr>g</fr></del> little gate for the aforesaid feet. And
should the bottom of these come off in one piece, you can repair it well. And
the scales from the top of the toes will come out well.</ab>

<head>Marks from the <tl>points of <m>iron wire</m></tl> which are found
on the head of the animal</head>

<ab><del><fr>L</fr></del> With the <tl>points</tl>, one has previously
set the stance, especially that of the head. But the head being pierced,
there remains around the hole some moisture and a little exudation,
which hinders the <m>sand</m> from covering the <tl>point</tl> &amp; there
always remains some little opening <del><fr>g</fr></del>. But to avoid
this, you can plant <add>in the slab of earth</add> an
<tl><m>iron</m> point</tl>, <del><fr>arro</fr></del> cleaned &amp;
rounded at the top end, &amp; on this end place there a little <m>hard
wax</m> or <del><fr>du</fr></del> a little <m>mastic</m> or
<m>cement</m>, and by means of this <tl>hot <m>iron</m>
wire</tl>, hold in place the throat of the animal, which can be removed
when you come to uncover the belly &amp; the throat to make the second
