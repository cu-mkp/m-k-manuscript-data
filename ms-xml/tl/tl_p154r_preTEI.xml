<ab><m>Gold as gilding</m> goes away once the piece is reheated &amp;
kept in high heat, especially if there is some <m>lead</m>, for
<m>lead</m> will pierce in the fire a piece with <m>gold</m>, because it
holds closely with <m>â˜¿</m>.</ab>

<ab>Because it is fatty &amp; grips &amp; sticks to the <tl>knife</tl> or

<comment rid="c_154r_01"/>Sometimes <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> take on, through certain fumes,
some color during the casting. But these are not at all scales &amp;
crust, but rather this color goes away with <m>whitening</m>

<ab>When <pro>goldsmiths who work large wares</pro> have
forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that
it bursts &amp; cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,
when it is well melted, some <m>dry mortar</m> composed of <m>sand</m> &amp;
<m>good lime</m> which has been worked, &amp; pulverize it &amp; throw
it in.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> do not work at all with
the <m>silver from <cn>reals</cn></m> that is not alloyed, because it is
<m>leady</m> &amp; when forging it sours.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">

Some solder, for small works &amp; things which only go in the fire
once, with some <cn>old sou</cn> &amp; <cn>carolus</cn>, reheated &amp; beaten. 
However, if the <cn>sou</cn> is not very
good, the <m>solder</m> eats away &amp; one needs to solder there twice,
&amp; one finds there too much <m>copper</m>. Others solder with
<ms>half</ms> <m>silver</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms> <m>fine copper</m>.</ab>

<ab>Once well pulverized &amp; ground on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, &amp;
mixed with the aforesaid <m>sand of <fr>noyau</fr></m>, and dried slowly
without reheating, it endures several casts of <m>lead</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m>. <m>Copper</m> &amp; <m>latten</m> come out well. But if it
is not well ground, like <m><la>crocum</la></m>, it goes to the bottom,
if the <m>sand</m> is not tempered thickly enough.</ab>

<ab>They are not made by themselves if they are not aided by some
