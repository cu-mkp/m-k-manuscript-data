<head>Animals dried in an <tl>oven</tl></head>

<ab>Small <del><fr>s</fr></del> <al>cats</al> are skinned and one
removes their eyes &amp; all their entrails. One puts a <tl>small
stick</tl> vertically between their teeth to make them open their mouths
wide. Then with <tl><m>iron points</m></tl> one attaches their feet to a
<tl>small board</tl>, giving them the fitting attitude &amp; gait. Once
thus attached by their feet <add>with <tl>small rings of <m>iron
wire</m></tl> thus</add>,<comment rid="c_130r_02"/> one needs to suspend them <env>in the sun</env>
with the backbone downward. In this manner they take
<del>&amp; <fr>d</fr></del> their shape &amp; dry, &amp; the belly
tightens &amp; the tail remains high <add>or with the bend that you will
have given it</add>. Once a little dry by this means, one turns the head
as one wants, securing it with some tool. Then one finishes drying it in
an <tl>oven</tl> when the bread is drawn. Next, one places in the
hollow of the eyes <tl>balls of <m>lead</m> or of <m>wax</m></tl>, painted
according to nature. One paints them with <m>well-gummed ink</m> so that
they seem to be jet. One gives it a painted tongue, horns, wings &amp;
similar fancies. Thus for <al>rats</al> &amp; all animals.</ab>
