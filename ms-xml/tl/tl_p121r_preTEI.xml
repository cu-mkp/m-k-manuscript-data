<ab>a sign that it has some humidity, &amp; if the flower also had some
aquosity, it would rot. It also ought not to be <del>too</del> coarse,
for with its heaviness it would weigh down the flower &amp; make it lose
its form. Having thus chosen it as is needed, take a <tl>box</tl>, in
which you first make a mound of the said <m>sand</m>, on which you will set the
stalk of your flower, <del>in such a way</del> laid down so that the flower
touches neither the bottom nor the sides of the <tl>box</tl>, but
remains in the air. Then, weigh down the stalk with more <del>on</del>
<m>sand</m> in order that it remains firm &amp; fixed. Finally, take some of the
same <m>sand</m> &amp; with two <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> pulverize &amp; cast
it delicately on the flower, <del><fr>e</fr></del> imitating in that the flow of
an <ms><tl>hourglass</tl></ms>. And when the flower is as if
<del>half</del> covered, strike your <bp><tl>fist</tl></bp> on the table
where the <tl>box</tl> is set in order that the <m>sand</m> drops &amp; enters
everywhere. Finally, cover it all over and thus lay in other flowers,
in order, one over the other, as many as your <tl>box</tl> can contain.
That being thus arranged, expose it for <ms><tmp>several
days</tmp></ms> to <env>hot sun</env>. And while the flower dries, the
<m>sand</m>, which ever accompanies it &amp; holds it, does not allow that in
contracting, it shrivels &amp; closes in on itself, but it must dry in the same state as when you put it there. Now
take heed that you choose for that effect <pa><po>cornflowers</po></pa>,
<pa>marigolds</pa>, the <pa>yellow meadow flowers</pa> called
<la><pa>ranunculus</pa></la><comment rid="c_121r_03"/> or <la><pa>pa<corr><del>l</del></corr>ta
lupina</pa></la>,<comment rid="c_121r_02"/> <pa>amaranth</pa> &amp; suchlike, and <pa>broom</pa>,
and others that your experience will teach you.</ab>

it ought not to be so thin. Next, dry it well in the <env>sun</env> for
<ms><tmp>several days</tmp></ms> to remove all humidity from it, and
ventilate it like <m>grain</m> so that the dust goes away. Once it is
rid of that dust &amp; well dried, use it as you know.</ab>

Fortify them with <m>straw</m> or something else so that they may not
