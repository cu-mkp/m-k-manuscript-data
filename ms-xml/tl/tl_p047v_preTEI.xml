<ab>Some, to make it run neatly, put <ms>half</ms> <m><fr>metal</fr></m> &amp;
<ms>half</ms> <m>copper</m>. Others take one <ms>part</ms> of
<m>potin</m> &amp; one <ms>part</ms> of <del><m>copper</m></del>
<m>latten</m>. Others take one <ms>part</ms> of <m>candlestick
latten</m> &amp; one <ms>part</ms> of <m>basin latten</m>. And among
basins, the <m>latten</m> of larger ones is brittler than that of
skillets, because for making the curve of the round so small it is
necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, to which they give a more
ample curve of the round, a brittler substance can be taken. In any event,
the brittlest <m>latten</m> runs better &amp; casts more neatly, but
let it be cast very <del>neat</del> hot. <del>One</del> When one wants
to cast, one casts <m>lead</m> into the substance, which makes it flow
&amp; run &amp; goes up in <m>smoke</m>, &amp; keeps the <tl>mold</tl> from
corrupting. And if you want to cast fire pieces, mix in more
<m>rosette</m> than <m>latten</m>, in order that it be less breakable. The
<tl>crucibles for melting <m>metal</m></tl> should be better than
<tl>those for <pro>glassmakers</pro></tl> for <m>glass</m> is not as
heavy as <m>metal</m>. And in this instance, one needs to <m><tl>lute</tl></m> the
<tl>crucibles</tl> with <m>earth</m> and <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m>.</ab>

<head>Cast</head>

<ab>Finely <m>calcined pumice stone</m> casts 22 <ms>carat</ms>
<m>gold</m> without repair, but it needs to be ablaze and red like the
<m>metal</m>. And it withstands several casts.</ab>
