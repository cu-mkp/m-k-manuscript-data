<head>Colors for green leaves<comment rid="c_158v_02"/></head>

<ab>One usually paints them in <m>oil</m>, because <m>distemper</m>
colors have no hold. For <pa>marigold flowers</pa>, <m>lightly ground
minium</m> for some, &amp; for others which are more yellowish, a bit of
<m>massicot</m> with it. For green, the <m>verdigris</m> has depth &amp;
is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the
<m>verdigris</m> a little <m>yellow ocher</m> &amp; <m>stil de grain
yellow</m>. If the green is dark, put with it <m>charcoal of <pa>peach
tree</pa> pits</m>, which makes a <del><fr>v</fr></del> greenish black, in the
same way that black of <m><al>ox</al> foot bone</m> looks bluish. And
thus, by judgment &amp; discretion, put the color on the <m>natural
flower or leaf</m> to see whether it comes close. <comment rid="c_158v_01"/>But layer it
transparently, so as not to cover the lines of the work.</ab>

<head>Large <tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>It makes it come out neater, &amp; even if it is <add>a little</add>
thick, it does not hold to any place because it has no body. I have thus
fumigated my <tl><fr>noyau</fr> molds</tl> for <m>tin</m> &amp;
<m>lead</m>, and have cast in the cold <tl>mold</tl>, well dried
beforehand, and it came out very neat. It is true that <m>lead</m> mixed
with <ms>half</ms> of <m>tin</m> was very hot, because the medal was thick.</ab>

<head>Gate</head>

<ab><del>Even though</del> <add>If</add> the medal is very thick, for
this reason do not give it as thick a gate. It suffices for the gate
to have <ms>half of its thickness</ms>. But if it is thin,
give it a gate of its thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the gate
where typically the material becomes porous.</ab>

Never forget to <m>oil</m> the <m>wax</m> gate when you mold plants
or flowers, otherwise it breaks &amp; cannot be taken out.
