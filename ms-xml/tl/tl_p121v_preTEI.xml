<head>For casting in <m>silver</m></head>

<ab>You need to arrange your animals as said and compose the same <m>sand</m>
<del>two <ms>parts</ms> <fr>d</fr></del> out of 4 <ms>parts</ms> of
<m>plaster</m>, of two <ms>parts</ms> <m>reheated brick</m>, &amp; one
<ms>part</ms> <m>reheated <add>feather</add> alum</m>, and mix
it well. Then, having been prepared thus, and you wishing to mold it,
take the three <ms>parts</ms> of an <tl><ms>earthenware bowl, from which
the <pro>peasants</pro> eat their soup</ms></tl>, of the aforesaid
<m>sand</m>, &amp; add to it <m>pure <add>feather</add> alum,
reheated &amp; pulverized</m> in the <tl>mortar</tl>, <ms>as much as you
can take with 4 <bp>fingers</bp> and the <bp>thumb</bp></ms>, or a
<ms>small double <bp>handful</bp></ms>. Then, mix <corr><del>mix</del></corr> well &amp; wet
with a little <m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; the rest of the <m>common
water</m>, <add><mark>+</mark></add><comment rid="c_121v_01"/> &amp; stir it with your <tl>spatula</tl> so
that it all becomes like a <m>thick sauce</m> or <m>thin
<pa>mustard</pa></m>, &amp; having rubbed the animal with <m>eau-de-vie</m> with the
<tl>paintbrush</tl>, cast, &amp;
blow, and beat the <tl>table</tl> to shake the <tl>mold</tl>, &amp; do as
with others.

<add>Do not forget to put in it <m><la>crocum</la></m>, for it prevents
the <tl>molds</tl> from cracking &amp; is appropriate for all

<head><m>Silver</m> for casting</head>

<ab>It is <m>not fine silver but alloyed</m>, &amp; which does not
become perfectly white on the fire because they put it to whiten after the
fusion to also clean it of the <m>solder</m> <del>or of this</del>. When
you need to attach some <del>leg</del> animal against another or to
repair, it is commonly <m><cn>teston</cn> silver</m>. And all
<m>alloyed silver</m>, as long as it is sweet, is good.</ab>

<ab>Before starting to cast <add>in <m>silver</m></add>, one needs to
have <m>earth</m> <del>of which</del> which withstands the fire, like
the <m>sandy earth</m> <del>of <fr>qu</fr></del> mixed with <m>cloth
waste which <pro>founders</pro> use to cast their <wp>cannons</wp></m>, or any
<m><tl>good lute</tl></m> which withstands the fire, in order to surround your
<tl>molds</tl> &amp; fortify them, for they must be all red. One
needs to also bind them with <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>.</ab>

<ab>That before <del>casting <fr>l'ar</fr></del> reheating the <tl>molds</tl>, you
have the mixture one needs to make the <m>silver</m> run.</ab>

<ab>If the <pro>goldsmiths</pro> knew <corr><del>knew</del></corr> the substance to make
<m>silver</m> run in their works, they would buy much of it. Some buy it five
<cn>sous</cn> for a <ms><fr>denier</fr></ms>.</ab>

Before <del>binding</del> <m><tl>luting</tl></m> &amp; strengthening your <tl>molds</tl>
for <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> with the aforesaid <m>earth</m>, one
needs for the cast to be made &amp; the vents, &amp; the <tl>molds</tl>
to have been reheated <del>of</del> very red to burn the animals,
flowers, and plants that are inside, &amp; to clean them well of the
<m>ashes</m>. Once quite clean &amp; prepared, <m><tl>lute</tl></m> them &amp; bind them
with <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl>, &amp; reheat them again until they will
be quite red.</ab>
