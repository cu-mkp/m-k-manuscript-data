<ab>Take <m>white pebbles that are found by the <env>rivers</env> &amp;
among the <env>sand bank</env> &amp; <env>paths</env>, which are
somewhat transparent</m>, &amp; if they are perfectly transparent it
will be better. If not, use the best &amp; whitest that you can. Calcine
them three or 4 times in your <tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl>, &amp; extinguish
them in <m>water</m> or <m>vinegar</m>. Next, take a
<ms>℥</ms> of them and <tl>pestle</tl> them in a
<tl>totally pure <m>copper</m> mortar</tl> &amp; with a <tl>pestle of
pure <m>copper</m></tl>, and grind them until they become very fine
&amp; soft powder, and this is a sign that they have taken the substance
of <m>copper</m>, enough for giving them greenness. At that time, on your
<ms>℥</ms> of <m>pebbles</m>, put in three
<ms>℥</ms> of <m>good minium, not adulterated by
brick</m> &amp; anything else, and grind everything together again very
well in a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>. And on all of this, put in a
<ms><fr>gros</fr></ms> <add><del>for
<ms>℥</ms></del></add> of <m><fr>sel de verre</fr></m>;
&amp; some &amp; the <pro>common people</pro> put in
<del><fr>e</fr></del><comment rid="c_070r_03"/> <m>sandiver</m> that they find at the
<pro>glassmakers</pro>' or <pro>apothecaries</pro>'. But <m>alkali
salt</m>, as you know, is better.

In this way, the <pro>common people</pro> make <m>emeralds</m> &amp; cast in
<m>sand</m>. If you do not have a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>, grind
<corr><del>with</del></corr> <del>a <fr>mort</fr></del> in a <tl>kettle
of pure <m>copper</m></tl>.

One needs to reheat <tl>crucibles</tl> before putting in materials, and
put them in the <tl><fr>fornaise</fr></tl> or <tl><fr>four à

<head>For <m>ruby</m> take <m>gold leaf</m></head>

<ab>Raise your <tl>furnace</tl> <ms>by two <tl>tiles</tl></ms> all
around, because one needs more heat for making <m>rubies</m> than for
<m>emeralds</m>. And take one <ms>℥</ms> of <m>white
calcined pebbles</m> and put it in a <tl>mortar of <m>glass</m></tl>, &amp; having ground it coarsely with the <tl>pestle</tl> of the same,

Some say that, mixing the <m>gold</m> with the <m>pebbles</m> and the

Others say that it is necessary that the <m>gold</m> be cemented several
