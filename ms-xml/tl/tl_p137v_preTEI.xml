<head>Tempering <m>sand for <tl>molds</tl> of flat medals</m></head>

<ab>Flat medals of <m>wax</m> or <m>metal</m> are <m>oiled</m> very
lightly &amp; then are touched with a <tl>paintbrush</tl> with
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. And in order that the <tl>mold</tl>, wetted with
<m>water</m>, takes without refusing the <m>oiled</m> thing, one heats
the <m>water</m> well for tempering the <m>sand</m>, for with <m>cold water</m>
it would refuse. Medals are <m>oiled</m> because they are not malleable
&amp; thus could break the <tl>mold</tl>. And animals, which are
malleable, do not want to be <m>oiled</m>. <m>Hot water</m> should be
<ms><sn>of such heat that you cannot hold your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>
there without feeling strong heat</sn></ms>. Temper your <m>sand</m> thicker for flat medals &amp; solids than for <al>lizards</al> &amp; fine things.
Your <m>sand</m> having set, clean &amp; scrape your <tl>mold</tl> on one side
&amp; the other, &amp; make a notch at the foot &amp; the border of the
medal on the side of the gate, in order that you can take it away
better. Lower also <add>the <tl>mold</tl>, scraping</add> the 
medal all around, in order that, from all sides, you can take it away
without it corrupting the <tl>mold</tl>. Next, make your scorings around
<del>of the</del> the first <tl>mold</tl> cast <del><fr>mes</fr></del>,
in order that the second cast joins with it without varying, &amp;
especially make a notch at the bottom of the <tl>mold</tl>
where the head of the molded thing is. Make some also at the sides of
the gate. This done, dip the reverse of the first <tl>mold</tl> in
<m>water</m>, <m>oil</m> it, &amp; thus it will not be imbibed. Rub
the reverse of the medal with <m>eau-de-vie</m> &amp; secondly cast,
tempering in <m>hot water</m>. If you have molded a medal <fr>en noyau</fr>, 
having made the first cast &amp; this one having set,
outline, with the <tl>point of a knife</tl>, the surround of the medal,
in order that it is raised on the cast &amp; not buried in it. Then
having made the second cast &amp; having opened your <tl>mold</tl>,
<del>have</del> take away the medal in one go, with <del>one</del> two
<tl>knife points</tl> <del><fr>q</fr></del>, and that one takes it from
the side of the gate &amp; the other from the side of the head, which is
opposite.</ab>

Take care not to <m>oil</m> your medal too much, for if the <m>oil</m>
seeps out, it diverts the <m>sand</m> from becoming smooth &amp; amassing, &amp;
makes it wavy &amp; lumpy. One should only touch the middle of the medal
<del>of the <fr>p</fr></del><comment rid="c_137v_01"/> with the <tl>point of an <m>oiled</m>
paintbrush</tl>, &amp; then spread the <m>oil</m> everywhere.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">


Make especially sure that the gate is the widest you can
<del><fr>p</fr></del> toward the medal &amp; embraces it well, that the
entrance of the gate is ample, always narrowing toward the medal. Do
not forget also to notch the entrance of the gate.</ab>
