<head>Gunner</head>

<ab>There are three reinforce rings on a cannon, one at the breech, one
in the middle, one at the mouth. When founders want to work on their
piece or have a cannon or another lighter piece and easier to carry,
they make it from the breech ring to the middle one in the same size and
proportions as the balls described below. But they taper it more or less
one <ms>line</ms> on each side from the middle ring to the mouth ring,
always using a compass for their measures from the straight line which
they draw in the <fr><tl>modelle en <m>papier</m></tl></fr> whatever
pattern. And this reduction is consequently equivalent to seven or eight
<ms>quintals</ms> less. And this does not make the piece less secure.
This is done for big pieces, but for pieces smaller than the moyen, one
has to keep the aforesaid proportion and make the piece in one straight
line from one end to the other. Usually the trunnions are commonly
situated one foot away from the middle ring in the direction of the
breech.

But because some gunners prefer a piece heavier at the front for it is
easier to adjust and for that purpose, it is sufficient to place the
trunnions closer to the breech and further away from the middle. On the
contrary if you want to make it heavier at the bottom, you will place
the trunnions

closer to the middle of the piece or forward in direction of the mouth.
When you bore your piece make a fluted cast <m>iron</m> box like a bed
post and and there must be sixteen flutes or notches in which you will
fix sixteen well-even blades, so altogether they will cut and scrape
similarly. Because should some not cut or scrape, there would be some
waves and spaces in the cannon that would make it ribbed and there would
danger that the piece might break in its middle. In order to avoid this
the bore has to go evenly from the breech to the mouth and the piece's
mouth must be evenly hard so the <m>powder</m> will be released at once
with more strength. On the contrary, if it is blocked it goes sideways
and makes the piece break.</ab></div>
