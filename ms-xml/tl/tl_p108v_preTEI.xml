<ab>thus one mixes it &amp; reduces it into
<del><fr>p</fr></del><comment rid="c_091v_01"/> <m>small stones</m>, purging it of its
<m>impurities</m>. Then, one puts it to cook neatly in a
<del><tl>pot</tl></del> <add><tl>earthen vessel</tl></add><comment rid="c_108v_02"/> in
the <tl><fr>fornaise</fr> of <pro>those who make <tl>pots</tl></pro></tl>, and one
leaves it there until the <tl>pots</tl> are cooked. Next, one mixes it
again with <m>sal ammoniac water</m> &amp; one grinds it very well,
and one empties the <m>muddy &amp; clean water</m> into a separate
<tl>vessel</tl>. Again, one puts the same <m>water</m> on top &amp;
one grinds, &amp; again one puts the <m>muddy water</m> with the other.
And one does thus, until it has passed everything. In this way, one
purges &amp; cleanses it, &amp; one renders it very fine &amp;
handleable. Having taken away the <m>water</m> by tilting it or with a
<tl>sponge</tl>, one takes the residue and one dries it. Then,
moistening it with the aforesaid <m>water</m>, like one does with
the other <del><m>water</m></del> <m>sand</m>, one uses it in a
<tl>frame</tl>, where, if it retracts, it is a sign that it
has not reheated enough &amp; that one needs to reheat it further. This
one is appropriate for molding all <m>metals</m>, and especially
<m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m>, and the more it is used, the better it
is. One needs to set aside the one in which you cast <m>lead</m> or
<m>tin</m>, for it would sour the <m>gold</m> you would cast in it.</ab></div>

After your <m>feather alum</m> is cooled,
<tl>pestle</tl> it in a <tl>mortar</tl>, then grind it on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>, and it will be rendered into very fine wooly
filaments which give bond to the <m>sand</m> without getting burned as
other things do, which is a beautiful invention. <tl>Pestle</tl> it in the
<tl>mortar</tl> by dragging the <tl>pestle</tl>, for the flying dust
could enter your <bp>throat</bp> or land on your <bp>face</bp>, which
will give you <sn>reason to scratch yourself well</sn>. Put it in the <tl>mortar</tl> a little

better</ab>

very well, &amp; moisten it moderately with some <m>water</m>, &amp; keep
it in a <tl>pit</tl> or in a <tl><fr>terrine</fr></tl>, and make numerous
