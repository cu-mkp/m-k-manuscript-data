<ab>The <pro>furbisher</pro> buys his blades by the <ms>dozen</ms>, which
are not fully drawn by the tang because he does this himself to adjust
them well to the <del><fr>l</fr></del> pommel &amp; <wp>guards</wp>.</ab>

<ab><pl>Spanish</pl> ones are deemed better for being of <m>better steel
&amp; iron</m>, but they are not as <tl>well-forged</tl> as <wp>swords from
<pl>Vienne</pl></wp> in <del><fr>pro</fr></del> <pl>Dauphiné</pl>. The
<pl>Spanish</pl> ones are not as well ground coming from the
<tl>forge</tl>, because they grind them with the
<tl><bp>foot</bp></tl>,<comment rid="c_095r_05"/> &amp; this is what
makes them wavy.</ab>

<ab>Blades from <pl>Vienne</pl> commonly cost xviii or 19
<ms><cn>lb</cn> a dozen</ms>.</ab>

<ab>The first thing the <pro>furbisher</pro> does when he gets his new
blades is to draw out their tang, which he does himself or has done by
<pro>locksmiths</pro> or <pro>farriers</pro>, giving him some
<cn>liard</cn> for his charcoal. Next, they
pass it over a <tl>grindstone</tl> to make it
cut,<comment rid="c_095r_07"/> then lay it down on the
<tl><fr>chameau</fr></tl>, and <add>with</add> some <tl><m>pulverized
emery</m></tl>, fine &amp; soft as <m>flour</m>, &amp; mixed with <m>oil</m>
to make it hold, they furbish the <wp>sword</wp> with the <tl>stick</tl> used to
remove the traces of the <tl>grindstone</tl>, and then <del>the</del>
clean the <wp>sword</wp> <del><fr>po</fr></del>well<comment rid="c_095r_03"/> with the
<tl><m>emery</m></tl> and give it a <ms>drop</ms> or two of <m>oil</m>, which
they spread with the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> to give it luster. Having
put the <m>oil</m>, they furbish the <wp>sword</wp> again on the
<tl><fr>chameau</fr></tl> with the
<tl><m><df><fr>felin</fr></df></m></tl>, which is a
<tl><m>thunderstone</m></tl> mounted in the middle of a stick like the
<tl><fr>fustée</fr></tl>, and this stick is called the <tl><df><fr>baton à
<m>felinder</m></fr></df></tl>. Next, having passed it on the
<tl><m><fr>felin</fr></m></tl>, they furbish it with <tl><m>chalk</m></tl> &amp;
the <m>oil</m> which is on the <wp>sword</wp>. Next, they wipe it &amp; go over
it again, &amp; furbish with <tl><m>dry chalk</m></tl>. And at the end, when they
are ready mounted, one gives them the edge with the
<tl><fr>gratteau</fr></tl>.<comment rid="c_094v_07"/>
<del><fr>Ai</fr></del></ab>

<ab>Once furbished, one mounts it on the <wp>guards</wp> which one presents to
know if they are quite suitable. And taking hold of a blade such that
the whole ricasso is held in the <tl><bp>hand</bp></tl>, one conjectures
that it will be just as heavy once mounted.</ab>

<ab>One puts the blade in a <tl><oc>vise</oc></tl> between two pieces of
<m>wood</m>, then with a <tl>file</tl>, they enlarge the opening of the
<wp>guard</wp><comment rid="c_095r_09"/> if it is necessary. Then, to rivet it,
one places on the rivet<comment rid="c_095r_12"/> <del>a piece of</del>
&amp; the pommel a piece of <m>wood</m>, &amp; with a <tl>hammer</tl>,
one beats on it to align &amp; secure the pommel well. Then, with the
<tl>hammer</tl>, one finishes the rivet when the pommel is well secured
&amp; does not wobble. The <m>wood</m> is put there so as not to spoil
the pommel. Next, one finishes the rivet with a <tl>file</tl> or
<tl>chisel</tl>. And some make <del>the <fr>b</fr></del> the rivet in a
square diamond-shape,<comment rid="c_095r_11"/> but it is not as good
as the round one, for, when faceted, the rivet breaks.</ab>
