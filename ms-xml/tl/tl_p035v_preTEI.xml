<ab>Take two <tl>small <m>wooden</m> bushels</tl> @of the <ms>same
size</ms>, which should be hollow on the bottom exterior by about the
<ms>width of the back of a <tl>knife</tl> or more</ms>. One of these
will remain empty, &amp; on the bottom of the other you will glue
<m>kernels of <pa>grain</pa></m> with <m>starch</m> so that it will be
covered entirely with <m><pa>grain</pa></m>, &amp; it will seem to be
filled with it. Take also a <tl><m>wooden</m> bell</tl> into which you
will place as much <m><pa>grain</pa></m> as can be held <ms>within the
capacity of one of the bushels</ms>, and over the top put a simple
<tl>piece of <m>leather</m></tl> that fits tightly inside the
<tl>bell</tl>. Put all into a <tl>bag</tl> or a <tl>napkin</tl> or a
<tl>folded handkerchief</tl>, if you do not want to use a
<tl><pro>conjuror</pro>’s pouch</tl>. First show the empty
<tl>bushel</tl>, then in front of the audience fill it with
<m><pa>grain</pa></m>, then put it back in the <tl>napkin</tl>. Next,
leave that one there &amp; take the other where the
<del><fr>le</fr></del> <m><pa>grain</pa></m> is glued with <m>starch</m>
&amp; it will seem to be the first one, filled with
<m><pa>grain</pa></m>. Put it under a <tl>hat</tl> &amp; place the
<tl>bel</tl>l on the <tl>table</tl>, gently for the first time. And if
you like, promptly &amp; without stopping, show the bottom which will be
covered with <tl><m>white leather</m> of the color of the
<m>wood</m></tl>. Then pretending to show the <tl>bushel</tl> that is
under the <tl>hat</tl>, you will turn it deftly to the side that is
empty &amp; leave it covered. Then you will command that by
<la>invisibilium</la> the <m><pa>grain</pa></m> pass into the
<tl>bell</tl>, which you will have tapped shortly before on the
<tl>table</tl> a little strongly, &amp; the <m><pa>grain</pa></m> will
fall to the bottom &amp; cover the <tl>piece of <m>leather</m></tl>.
Then lift the <tl>hat</tl>; the <tl>bushel</tl>
<del><fr>semb</fr></del>will be found empty and the <tl>bell</tl> full
of <m><pa>grain</pa></m>, which you will scrape deftly along with the
<tl>piece of <m>leather</m></tl>
