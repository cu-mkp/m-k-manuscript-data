longer than others. And because they are not very thick, one wastes less
<m>charcoal</m> melting <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m>, for they heat
quickly. They do not drink as much <m>silver</m> as the others,
&amp; for this reason, there is hardly any <m>residue</m><comment rid="c_047r_03"/> to be
found in them. They are less prone to tipping as others that have a
