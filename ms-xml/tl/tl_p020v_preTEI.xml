<head><md>For whitening the <bp>face</bp></md></head>

<ab>Pestle <m><pa>puffball</pa></m> in <m>cistern water</m>, &amp; no
other, &amp; wash with this <m>whitened water</m>. This is considered
quite singular. And I believe that making it from <m><pa>wheat</pa>
starch</m> &amp; to use it would be even better.</ab>

<head><md>Against <bp>winds</bp>, colic, &amp;c</md></head>

<ab><m>Sap squeezed or water <del><ill/></del> distilled from
<pa>orange</pa> peel</m> is excellent <md>against the windy colic</md>.
<m>Candied peel</m>, too, is excellent <md>for the <bp>winds of the
<bp>belly</bp></bp></md>. And to make a trial of it, having poured <m>foaming
wine</m> in a <tl><m>glass</m></tl>, squeeze <m><pa>orange</pa>
juice</m> on the <m>wine foam</m>, which proceeds only from vapor &amp;
wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also,
if you squeeze <m>juice</m> against a <tl>candle</tl> it will burn all
the brighter.

<ab>They want to be planted <env>in a very humid place where with such a
<oc>rodier</oc> well or fountain one can water it often</env>, for by
this means they are tender. Otherwise a hard heart forms inside,
which takes from it all its goodness.

<ab>Pestle an <m><pa>onion</pa></m> with <m>verjuice</m> &amp; leave it

Or else, apply <m>black soap</m> on the burn. Experimented.

<ab>Bell tower of <pl>Rodez</pl>, <env>church</env> of <pl>Albi</pl>,

<pl>Toulouse</pl> named Cardaillac as one of the most beautiful in

<ab><tmp>Every morning</tmp>, take two or three <m>eggs</m> laid one or

them. Take the <m>centers</m> well dusted with <m>sugar</m>. And next
