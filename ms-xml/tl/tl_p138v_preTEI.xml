<head><m>Talcum</m> mixed in the <tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>I took the one from which I had pulled the <m>oil</m>. I crushed it
very finely even more <del><fr>s</fr></del> in a <tl><m>steel</m>
mortar</tl> with a <tl>pestle</tl>, very lumpy like a <tl>file</tl>. I
rendered it very fine &amp; in a cottony &amp; downy powder. I mixed it
with <m>sand</m> &amp; mixed it together &amp; cast it <fr>en noyau</fr>. It
molded <del><fr>en no</fr></del> very neatly &amp; one ought not to doubt
that it holds in the fire.</ab>

<head><m>Gold</m> cast very thinly</head>

<ab>When <pro>goldsmiths</pro> have something to <m>solder</m> promptly
and do not have leisure to <tl>forge</tl> it, they melt some
<m>gold</m> and then throw it on a <tl><m>cloth</m></tl> or other
<tl>things that withstand the fire</tl>, and they flatten it immediately
with a <tl>hammer</tl> or similar thing. And it ends up very thin &amp;
even receives the impression of the <tl><m>cloth</m></tl>.</ab>

<ab><emph><m>Fine gold</m></emph>, not alloyed, can be cast in medals,
but not in plants &amp; <al>lizards</al> &amp; very fine things if it
is not alloyed.</ab>

<ab>A <pa>pansy</pa> anointed with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m> can be cast
in <m>alloyed gold</m>.</ab>

<ab>And other thin leaves, but only if the branch is not too big and
the leaves, separately cast, can be <m>soldered</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Counterfeit<comment rid="c_003r_02"/> diamonds put in a work</m></head>

<ab>Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with <m>black modeling wax</m>, 
then anoint the inside, thus <m>waxed</m>, with
<m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, &amp; then powder this with <m>lamp smoke</m>,
for it is necessary that <del>this</del> its color not have
luster for <m>false stones</m>. This done, set in your <m>stone</m>
<del>&amp; then</del> with a bit of <m>wax</m>, then, with a
<tl><m>steel</m> point</tl> &amp; a <tl>small finishing hammer</tl>,
join the edge of the setting to the <m>stone</m> in order that
<env>daylight</env> does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
<m>stone</m>, which would break.</ab>
