<ab>If you want to cast <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>copper</m> or
<m>latten</m>, it is necessary that they be perfectly red, &amp;
inflamed on the inside when you cast, &amp; perfectly reheated two
times, if there is something inside to be burnt &amp; cleaned.</ab>

<ab>The <tl>molds</tl> of animals that one burns must be heated in
such a way that the animal burns. But if it has <m>thick bones</m>, it is
troublesome to pull out &amp; <m>☿</m> often breaks
some fine things by its weightiness. One does not put
<m>☿</m> in <tl>molds</tl> that can open. This readily
happens with flowers, the <tl>mold</tl> of these does not open because
they are made all in one go.</ab>

<ab>When you want to reheat your <tl>molds</tl>, put the <tl>clamps</tl>
on the joints, in order that, when reheating, they do not bend,
contract, or break. This is done after the gate is made.</ab>

<ab>The <m>scrapings of the mold</m> can still be used, using them in
place of <m>brick</m>, after having reheated them, &amp; also the
<m>pieces of the molds that have been used</m>. One <m><tl>lutes</tl></m> with it
also important things, like works of <m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m>. One
also reheats it, &amp; prepares it with <del><fr>se</fr></del> <m>sal 
ammoniac water</m>, as <m><de>spat</de><comment rid="c_108r_02"/> from <pl>Germany</pl></m>, &amp; it is
<m>excellent sand</m> for <tl>frames</tl> for all <m>metals</m>.</ab>

<ab>The <tl>molds</tl> of things where one needs to burn them inside, do
<del><fr>souf</fr></del> not open until the things which are inside are
burnt, like with <tl>molds</tl> of <al>crayfish</al>, <al>crabs</al>,
<al>stag beetles</al>, portraits &amp; pieces of <m>sulfured
black wax</m>, which do not release well.</ab>

<ab>One ought not to mold on <m>brick</m> or <m>wood</m> because they
<del><fr>l’ea</fr></del> drink &amp; attract <m>water</m> too soon, and
do not allow the <m>sand</m> to set. It would never be better than on a
<tl><m>fresh clay</m> slab</tl>. Yet, I have experienced that <m>grey
earth</m> dries the <tl>mold</tl> too soon. <m>The yellow</m> is
better.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

For medals, and flat things, it is necessary that the <m>sand</m> be thick
enough, wet, because it sets quickly. And when the <m>sand</m> is thus thick,
one can hit and shake the <tl>table</tl> where the <tl>mold</tl> is
placed, to make it run everywhere. But when the <m>sand</m> is thin, like for
flowers and plants, one ought not to hit, nor when there is something
attached with <m>wax</m> or another thing that is subject to coming off,
like <al>crayfish</al> legs or similar things. And if the <m>sand</m> is, by
chance, too thick, you promptly put in it some
<corr><del>pour</del></corr> <m>water</m>. Having put the <m>sand</m> in
<m>water</m>, <del>it</del> examine that it is thick at the bottom &amp;
thin on top. The thinnest is cast at the beginning and then becomes
porous, &amp; the thickest at the end in order to fortify the
<tl>mold</tl>.</ab>
