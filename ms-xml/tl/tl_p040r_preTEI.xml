<ab>at all expert in painting. If your <m>glass</m> pane is bulging as
if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When you apply
your <m>turpentine</m> colors to your <m>glass</m> panes, first place
them on a hot tile &amp;, once they are hot, spread your colors &amp;
leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your <m>tin</m> sheet.</ab>

<ab>Some take the <m>root of <pa><la>lapathium acutum
maius</la></pa></m>, which seems to be <m><pa><pro>monk</pro>’s
rhubarb</pa></m> or <m><pa>sorrel</pa></m>, &amp; with the root, which
is yellow in the <tmp>summer</tmp>, they <m>dye</m> <m>thread</m> &amp;

<head><m>Aquafortis</m></head>

<ab>Some put <del>on</del> <add>for</add> four <ms>pounds</ms> of
substance of<m>aquafortis</m> <del>four</del> which are in the
<tl>retort</tl> four <ms>ounces</ms> of <m>common water</m> in the
<tl>receptacle</tl>, which is better than putting it into the
<tl>retort</tl>. One de-phlegms &amp; calcines <m>alum</m> in order that
the <m>water</m> does not have as much dregs. Several make it without
de-phlegming the <m>alum</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Vinegar</m></head>

<ab>One takes for granted that the <m>mineral salt</m> that looks like
<m>marble</m> &amp; is called <m><pl>Cardona</pl> salt</m> in
<pl>Catalonia</pl> &amp; at the border of <pl>Spain</pl>, <del>thr</del>
when one heats it red-hot &amp; throws it <del>in the</del> all red or
quite hot into <m>wine</m>, it turns it into <m>very good vinegar</m>.
Some make it with <m>water</m> poured on <m>pomace soured</m> after
being pressed by <pro>vintagers</pro>, but it does not keep, &amp;
spoils in heat &amp; <env>thunder storms</env>.</ab>

<head>Buttons of <m><fr>vermeilles</fr></m></head>

<ab>Because <m><fr>vermeilles</fr></m> do not fear fire, one cuts them
into lozenges flat<del><ill/></del> on one side, then one joins them
together in a star shape in a <m>paste of ground enamel</m>, next one
melts it &amp; one <m>gilds</m> the <m>enamel</m> with <m>gold leaf</m>
which one reheats.</ab>

<head><env>Grottos</env></head>

<ab>To fill some empty place that cannot be laden with some sort of
hanging rocks, one puts a piece of <m>thick parchment</m> close to the
fire, which shrinks &amp; crumples. Then one paints it with
<m>distemper</m>, then in <m>oil</m>. Next one affixes it.</ab>
