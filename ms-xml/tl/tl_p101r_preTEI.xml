there. Then, set it on the <tl>grate</tl> of your <tl>furnace</tl>,
having put under a few <tl>thick rounded squares</tl>. Next, fill your
<tl>furnace</tl> to the opening with <tl>charcoal</tl>, so that it will
be heaped, and let it kindle, and always maintain the heat evenly
without letting the <tl>charcoal</tl> decrease. And for this effect,
always make it so that the <tl>furnace</tl> is heaped &amp; full of
<tl>charcoal</tl>, and maintain it thus for one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms>.
The first experience that I made of it, it only returned a yellow mass,

<ab>The same <ms>dose</ms> is observed for all <m>gemstones</m>, namely
<ms>one weight of <m>calcined pebbles</m> on three of
<m>minium</m></ms>, <tl>pestling</tl> all separately in a
<tl><m>copper</m> mortar</tl> for <m>emerald</m> &amp; in an
<tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl> for making <m>topaz</m> or <m>amber</m>
color, with <tl>pestles</tl> identical to the <tl>mortars</tl>. The
<m>emerald</m> &amp; the <m>topaz</m> are of the same heat, &amp; for an
<ms><tmp>hour &amp; a half</tmp></ms> on the fire, for they could burn.
The <m>ruby</m> <del><fr>en</fr></del> wants more time &amp; more fire
&amp; colored with <m>gold leaf</m>. I believe that <m>pumice stone</m>
or <m>firestone</m> for the <m>ruby</m> would be better. See the
<m>enamels</m>. Try also mixing, in place of <m>pebbles</m>, pieces of
<m>colored glass</m> or <m>enamels</m>. If the mass is not colored
enough, <tl>pestle</tl> it more in the <tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl>.</ab>
