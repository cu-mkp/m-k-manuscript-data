<ab>again very well, then add in iii <ms>℥</ms> of
<m>minium</m>, &amp; <tl>pestle</tl> well again all together, &amp; put
it in the <tl>crucible</tl>, which you will cover with an appropriate
<tl>tile</tl>, a bit thick, in order that heat reverberates better
there. Then set it on the <tl>grill</tl> of your <tl>furnace</tl>,
having put under a few <tl>thick rounded squares</tl>. Next, fill your
<tl>furnace</tl> to the opening with <tl>charcoal</tl>, so that it will
be heaped, and leave it glowing, and always maintain the heat evenly
without letting the <tl>charcoal</tl> decrease. And for this effect,
always make so that the <tl>furnace</tl> is heaped &amp; full of
<tl>charcoal</tl>, and maintain it thus for one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms>.
The first experience that I made thus, it only returned a yellow mass,
as is only <m>vitrified minium</m>, &amp; some <ms><fr>grains</fr> of
<m>gold</m></ms> in a mass at the bottom. <rub>Try soldered <m>gold</m>
and accompanied with <m>antimony</m></rub>.</ab>

If you need greater heat, <del><fr>plie</fr></del> put on the edge of
the opening of the glowing <tl>furnace</tl> <tl>tiles</tl>, one against
the other, for making the heat reverberate.</ab>

<head><m>Topaz</m></head>

<ab>The same <ms>dose</ms> is observed for all <m>gemstones</m>, namely
<ms>one weight of <m>calcined pebbles</m> on three of
<m>minium</m></ms>, <tl>pestling</tl> all separately in a
<tl><m>copper</m> mortar</tl> for <m>emerald</m>, &amp; in an
<tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl> for making <m>topaz</m> or <m>amber</m>
color, with <tl>pestles</tl> identical to the <tl>mortars</tl>. The
<m>emerald</m> &amp; the <m>topaz</m> are of the same heat, &amp; for an
<ms><tmp>hour &amp; a half</tmp></ms> on the fire, for they could burn.
The <m>ruby</m> <del><fr>en</fr></del> wants more time &amp; more fire
&amp; colored with <m>gold leaf</m>. I believe that <m>pumice stone</m>
or <m>firestone</m> for the <m>ruby</m> would be better. See the
<m>enamels</m>. Try also mixing, in place of <m>pebbles</m>, pieces of
<m>colored glass</m> or <m>enamels</m>. If the mass is not colored
enough, <tl>pestle</tl> it more in the <tl><m>iron</m> mortar</tl>.</ab>

<m>Slightly burnt tartar</m> mixed among this makes beautiful yellow,
but one scarcely needs much. The <m><fr>arene</fr></m> also makes it
more yellow.</ab>

<head><m>Salt</m> for melting</head>

<ab>Mix <m>saltpeter</m> &amp; <m>common salt</m> and melt them together
&amp; cast on <m>melted copper</m> or <del><fr>ch</fr></del> in a
<fr>bain</fr>, &amp; it purifies &amp; makes it run marvellously. First,
one ought to <df>decrepitate</df> the <m>common salt</m>, that is to say
holding it over a good fire until it no longer crackles or, to melt it
better, in an <tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl>. And throw it neatly on
<tl><m>marble</m></tl>, then pestle it &amp; grind it very finely, then
put it in a <tl>crucible</tl> on <ms>as much</ms> <m>saltpeter</m> &amp;
let it boil, &amp; mix them together until</ab>
