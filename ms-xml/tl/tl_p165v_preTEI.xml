<ab>Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again,
put them back into the mixture of <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, <m>vinegar</m>
&amp; <m>eau-de-vie</m> where you killed the others, and they will keep
for a <tmp>long time</tmp> without spoiling.<comment rid="c_165v_03"/> If you have a <md>cut on your hand,</md>

they are subject to corrupting.</ab>

<ab>In order that they come out better, put from the gate to the edges
of these some <m>veins of wax</m>. Make sure also that under the belly
there is enough <m>wax</m>, for this is what makes the gate.</ab>
