it is necessary that you have reheated your <tl>furnace</tl>
<del>with</del> with a little of the <tl>big charcoal</tl>, such that
the bottom is red hot and then you will put there the aforesaid load of
<tl>charcoals</tl> in the middle of which you will put your <m>iron</m>,
not all at once but ten or fifteen <ms>lb</ms> each time. And when this
will be swallowed <del>&amp;</del> at the bottom of the <tl>furnace</tl>,
always put in as much again. And add three or four <ms>shovels</ms> of
<tl>new charcoal</tl> which should be of the biggest kind and remoistened,
in order that it may have more heat &amp; not be consumed too soon.
And when you see that your <tl>furnace</tl> is full of substance, around
two <ms>quintals</ms>, or less if you do not <corr><del>of it</del></corr> have that much, you will
leave the <tl>charcoal</tl> to be consumed by itself. And when the
<tl>charcoal</tl> is as it were reduced down to the level of the
<tl>furnace</tl>, you will be able to pour into <tl>molds</tl> &amp;
<tl><m>iron</m> or <m><fr>metal</fr></m><comment rid="c_016v_05"/> shells</tl>, which is even better
because one <m>iron</m> attaches to the other. And it is necessary that
the inside of the <tl>mold</tl> be well ashed with <m>tempered
ashes</m>, in order that it does not adhere to it.</ab>

<ab>They keep well in <m>bran</m> which makes them white &amp;

them in a <env>cool &amp; dry place</env>, in such manner that they are
not pressed together. It is better if there is a <m><pa>hemp</pa>
thread</m> throughout the wick, which gives it more light &amp; makes the wick hold up
straighter. Otherwise, if it is all of <m>cotton</m>, as those of
