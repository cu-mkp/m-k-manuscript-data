<head>Double layers</head>

<ab>The <pl>Flemish</pl> &amp; those who paint panels by the dozen only
make one layer &amp; finish at the first go, but the colors soon die.
And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer
them lightly &amp; not very thick, to soften them well.</ab>

<head>Colors in <m>oil</m> that are imbibed</head>
        
<ab>It is best that colors in <m>oil</m> are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
<m>oil</m> has remained in that part, which would make the colors die.
The <m>varnish</m> mends all this &amp; unites &amp; renders it similar
in one place as in another.</ab>
        
<ab>It is necessary that gold color be laid down thick, for if it were clear, it
would be imbibed &amp; would run.</ab>

<ab>The <pl>Flemish</pl> give a layer of <m>distemper glue</m>

<m>soot black</m> with the same <m>glue</m> &amp; let dry.

because the three aforesaid colors are gripping &amp; dry immediately.
Next they lay down the <m>gold</m>, then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
