<head><del>Black</del> Painting of armor</head>

<ab><m>Charcoal black</m> mixed with a little <m>lead white</m> is very
appropriate to make armor, mixing in a little <del>of <ill/></del>
<m>azure</m> if you wish. <m>Charcoal <add>black</add></m> by itself is
as if bluish.</ab>

<head>Painting of <m>crêpe</m></head>

<ab>First one needs to make the background greyish with <m>charcoal
black</m> mixed with <m>lead white</m> &amp; a little <m>azure</m>,
then <del><fr>resu</fr></del> after it is dry, heighten with strokes
&amp; lines in <m>lead white</m>.</ab>

<head>Folds in clothing</head>

<ab>In this, one needs to take care that none are made false, but that
only that which the natural can do is imitated. A <m>thick cloth</m>
hardly makes any folds, <m>taffetas</m> &amp; <m>silk cloth</m> make
more, &amp; <m>crêpe</m> more still. <del>Make</del> Heed which ones
should go lengthwise &amp; others across.</ab>

<head>Desiccative</head>

<ab><m>Lead white</m> &amp; <m>massicot</m> are the most desiccative,
nevertheless they need a good two <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. If you want
to prove whether an <m>oil</m> is desiccative, temper <m>lead white</m>
with it, &amp; if it produces a crust <del>in a
<ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms></del> soon it means that it will dessicate.</ab>

not.</ab>

<head>Mending the cracks in a panel</head>

<ab>If a painted panel breaks you can <m>glue</m> it well on the
reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it &amp;
repair it, it ought not to be with <m>glue</m>, which rots <env>in humid
weather</env> &amp; would swell when touched with the <m>oil</m> of the
painting. But take <m>white wax</m>, which is harder than the other.
The <m>oil</m> mixed in among the <m>wax</m> prevents it from
melting <env>in the sun</env>. The <m>wax</m> ought not to be hard, but
soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks &amp; crevices with the
<tl>tip of a knife</tl>, then scrape;</ab>
