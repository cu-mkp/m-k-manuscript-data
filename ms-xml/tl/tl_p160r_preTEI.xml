<ab>They are two <tl>sheets of <m>iron</m></tl> attached by four
<tl>small <m>iron</m> pillars</tl>, in such a way, however, that
<del>they</del> <add>the upper</add> <del>are</del> is able to have play
&amp; run freely the length of the <tl>pillars</tl>, &amp; that the
lower one is fixed. At the end of the <tl>pillars</tl> is affixed an
<m>iron</m> <pn>Sainct André</pn><comment rid="c_009v_04"/> cross, in the middle of which is a
<tl>screw</tl> which tightens the <tl>sheets</tl> against the
<tl>molds</tl> which are between the two. Or, for small <tl>molds</tl>,
one makes a <tl>frame</tl>, &amp; having put the <tl>molds</tl> between
two <tl>plates of <m>iron</m></tl>, one <del>sets</del> tightens them in
the <tl>frame</tl> with <tl>wedges</tl>. The <tl>large <m>wooden</m>
presses made with screws</tl>, besides being heavy to put near to the
<tl>forge</tl> for casting, one cannot know when they tighten too much,
&amp; very often they break the <tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

The <tl>screw</tl> is riveted to this <tl>stirrup</tl><comment rid="c_160r_01"/> which is
<tl>nailed</tl> on to the upper <tl>plate</tl>, &amp; by this means,
raises it &amp; <tl>presses</tl> it.

<head><m>Sand for flowers</m></head>

<ab>If it is cast thick, it bears down too much on the flowers &amp;
constricts them &amp; reduces them as if massed together. Take heed
therefore to temper it until thin, &amp; blow strongly before the flower
is covered. Cast at the side of the <tl>mold</tl>. And tempering the <m>sand</m>,
one ought not only to turn the <tl>spatula</tl> but to beat the <m>sand</m> in
<m>water</m> as if you were beating <m>glair of egg</m>.</ab>
