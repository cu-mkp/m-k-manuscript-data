<ab>I have cast with it the cleanest I have seen, in very small

which make <m>silver</m> runny, &amp; have made as if I had wanted to
cast <m>pure silver</m>. This alloy is white in
<tl><fr>bullitoire</fr></tl>, like any alloys which resemble, however
little, <m>☾</m>. For casting something delicate, use
this one.</ab>

<head>Cast of <m>latten</m></head>

<ab>I took the one of <tl><m>latten</m> skillets, which are beaten &amp;
forged thinly</tl>. <del><fr>I</fr></del> Once well heated, I cast in it
two or three <ms>grains, like <pa>peas</pa></ms>, of <m>sal
ammoniac</m>. This clarified it, like a mirror. Once very white from the
force of being hot, I cast in it some <m>pulverized calamine, raw &amp;
pure</m>. I cast it in its very red <tl>mold</tl>. It came out very neat
&amp; thin like <m>paper</m>, &amp; hollow on the reverse. But because
it had developed a <fr>chappe</fr>, I reheated it, that is to say
reddened, let it cool, then put it to be whitened, of one <ms>part</ms>
<m>raw tartar</m> &amp; of one <ms>half</ms> <m>common salt</m>. Once
well boiled, I rubbed it with a <tl>scratch-brush</tl>, in <m>clear
water</m>. And because the first time it had not</ab>

Do not let it cool when melting. It always makes a tail, like <m>melted
glass</m>, because of the <m>calamine</m>.</ab>

Usually, the <m>soft latten of skillets</m>, becomes red from casting,
especially when it stays a long time in the fire, <del><fr>m</fr></del>
because the <m>calamine</m> exhales itself. But <m>sour latten of
candlesticks</m> becomes yellow &amp; <m>pin filings</m>.</ab>
