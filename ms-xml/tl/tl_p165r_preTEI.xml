<ab>If, once it is ground, you let it dry without keeping it in

<head>Stretching a <m>canvas</m> picture</head>

<ab>If it is crumpled &amp; creased from being rolled up, moisten it
from behind with a <tl>wet sponge</tl>, &amp; you will stretch it very
evenly without spoiling it.</ab>

<head><m>Plaster</m> for molding</head>

<ab>When it is long to set &amp; dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty
&amp; humid, which is what makes it contract in fire &amp; crack,
causing flashing. That which is drawn from <env>lean soil</env> is the best.
<tl>Molds</tl> of <m>fatty plaster</m> ought not to be kept for a <tmp>long
time</tmp>, for they act like <m>fatty earth</m>, which when drying by itself,
cracks. <add>It is best to reheat them<lb/>
soon after they are made, &amp;
to cast. <m>Good plaster</m> keeps<lb/>
a <tmp>long time</tmp> in<lb/>
<tl>molds</tl>.</add></ab>

It needs to be well <m>oiled</m>, for it is more difficult to separate
the two halves of the <tl>molds</tl> than when it is mixed.</ab>

<ab>It can be imitated with <m>lake</m>, which surpasses the dragon's blood in beauty if, tempered in <m>oil</m>, you glaze on <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>. Tempered in <m>varnish</m>, it dies.</ab>

<ab>You could well make some <tl>puncheons</tl> according to the form of
their scales, &amp; making some bigger &amp; some smaller, according to
the shape of the neck, the body, &amp; the tail. If there is something
broken, you can graft it on with <tl>small <del>pieces</del> points of
<m>iron or steel wire</m></tl>, &amp; <m>glue</m> with <m><al>fish</al>
glue</m>, &amp; then cover it all with gray or black <m>wax</m>. But it
is necessary to let the <m>glue</m> dry for one <ms><tmp>day</tmp></ms>
