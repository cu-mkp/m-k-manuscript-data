<head>Modeling in <m>wax</m></head>

<ab>When <m>wax</m> is too hard, one mixes in <m>turpentine</m> or a
little <m>butter</m>, which <del>are <fr>pl</fr></del> renders the
<m>wax</m> more amiable and more appropriate than the <m>tallow</m>
that the <pl>Italians</pl> put in, because one often has to put the
<tl>tools</tl> in the <bp>mouth</bp>, which are better in <m><pa>boxwood</pa></m> or <m>bone of <al>hart</al></m>.</ab>

<ab>As the <m>wax</m> is melted, they have <m>sulfur</m> that is
melted in a <tl>spoon</tl> or <tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl>, &amp; they pour some
in the <m>melted wax</m>. And going to the bottom or
remaining on top, the <m>sulfur</m> leaves &amp; mixes only its substance amongst the
<m>wax</m> &amp; renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the <tl>mold</tl> gently like <m>butter</m>, without leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be advised not to give it too strong a fire.</ab>

<head>Molding <m>wax</m></head>

<ab>In order that your <tl>mold</tl> grips without repelling in any place on
a shape or image of <m>wax</m>, you need to anoint it with <m>oil</m>
and moisten your <m>sand</m> with <m>lukewarm water</m>, for the <m>cold
water</m> would repel the <m>oil</m> more &amp; would not have a good seating on it.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">



Anoint well, very lightly, with <m>oil</m>, so little that it hardly
appears. Then, rub with some <m>eau-de-vie</m>. Next, moisten your <m>sand</m>
with <m>lukewarm water</m> so that it does not repel the
<m>oil</m>.</ab>

<ab>It is better that they should be fixed through the blast-pipe in some piece of
thick plank, <del><fr>q</fr></del> for they are more secure for it; next, you can lightly
secure them from above. It is necessary that <tl>blast-pipes</tl> be 4

<ab>When you take them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove
their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
removed, they get sore gums &amp; mouth, &amp; can no longer eat. You
can keep them in a <tl>barrel</tl> full of <m>bran</m> or even better of
<m>earth</m>, <env>in a cool place</env>, or in a <tl><m>glass</m>
