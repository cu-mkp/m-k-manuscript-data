<ab>Grate <m><pa>brazilwood</pa></m> very finely, put it to soak one or
two <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> in <m>clear water</m>, then take this
<m>tinted water</m> &amp; add to it some <m>clear water</m> &amp; you
will make <del><fr>e</fr></del> <m>wine</m> as clear as you like. If you
please, put a <ms>drop</ms> of <m>lemon or orange juice</m> in it &amp;
it will immediately turn white. It can be drunk without danger.

<head><pro>Arquebusier</pro></head>

<ab>For shooting your arquebus precisely, it is necessary that the end
of the breech be &amp; come precisely on the edge of the touch-hole,
because in this manner the <m>powder</m> catches &amp; burns all at once
without blowing &amp; has more force &amp; does not push back. On the
contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the
<m>powder</m> catches sooner in this place, makes it push back, &amp;
blows, which a chambered arquebus<comment>c_043v_01</comment> clearly
shows, because it pushes back more than another. And since the barrel is
bigger at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for
that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. And then, the
thickness of the barrel gains about one <ms>line</ms> over the calibre,
and the sight another <ms>line</ms>. It would therefore be necessary to
either make the barrel all of one size or to raise the stock at the end
&amp; towards the muzzle, &amp; sink it in &amp; lower it towards the
breech<comment>c_043v_02</comment>. The weight of the <m>powder</m> must
be the third part of the ball.

<head>Hail-shot of the arquebus</head>

<ab>If you want it to go together, set a piece of <m>felt</m> or
<m>leather</m> or <m>paper</m> on top, according to the distance, &amp;
let the piece be made with a form precisely cut according to the caliber
of the arquebus<comment>c_043v_03</comment>.
