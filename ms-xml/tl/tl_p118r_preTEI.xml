<ab>Those which are found in the <env>sea</env> &amp; similarly those in
which certain <al>small crabs</al> dwell are very beautiful for
<env>grottos</env>, if they are stripped of the first crust of their
shell with <m>aquafortis</m>, for they truly appear to be made of

<ab>If your <tl>molds</tl> are of <m>good plaster</m> which withstands
well the fire, <del>&amp;</del> they will not crack at all, especially
if, with <tl>presses</tl>, they are squeezed well between two
<tl>boards</tl> or in a <tl>vessel filled with <m>ashes</m> or
<m>sand</m></tl>, &amp; in this way they will make no flashing. But if they do
make some, you can remove it with a <tl>burin</tl> that one calls
<tl><df><fr>chaple</fr></df></tl>, which has a tip like a small
<tl>chisel</tl>.</ab>
