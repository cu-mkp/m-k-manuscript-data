<ab>To mold well, one ought to cast in a big <tl>frame</tl> several
medals together, for when there is a lot of substance &amp; the
<tl><oc>crucible</oc></tl> is almost full, it heats more, &amp; then, if one
medal does not come out well, the other will be good.</ab>

<ab>It is better to melt in a <tl>bellows furnace</tl> than in a
<tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl>, because it gives a more vigorous heat. It
is true that <m>latten</m> melts well in the <tl><fr>four à
vent</fr></tl>, because it is easier to melt than <m>copper</m>, being
more brittle.</ab>

<ab>Some <emph><pro>founders</pro></emph> have this superstition,
that only <tmp>three days a week</tmp> are good for melting, namely
<tmp>Tuesdays</tmp>, <del><tmp>Wednesdays</tmp></del>
<tmp>Thursdays</tmp>, and <tmp>Saturdays</tmp>. The others, for them,
are unlucky.</ab>

<ab>When you mold, do not knock excessively on the medal, which is in
the <m>sand</m>, because it prevents it from releasing very neatly &amp;
shakes loose the <tl>mold</tl>.</ab>

<ab>Take heed also that the <m>sand</m> does not surpass the edges of the
<tl>frame</tl>, for it makes the molded medal higher than the cast,
&amp; in this way, <m>metal</m> will never enter the mold. Therefore,
always make sure that the surface of your cast object <add>sur</add>passes the <tl>mold</tl> in a straight line, and to do this, if it seems good to you, put a
piece of <tl><m><fr>carton</fr></m></tl> of whatever thickness you
please.</ab>

<ab><emph><pro>Founders</pro></emph>, in order to prevent their large cast
works from becoming porous, are careful to reheat their <tl>molds</tl> very well. And
to know if they have been reheated sufficiently, they knock against it with
their <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, &amp; if they start to <sn>ring</sn> like a pot,
then they are sufficiently reheated.</ab>

<ab><emph>To cast their <wp>cannons</wp> neatly, they</emph> mix their <m>earth</m>
with some <m>fine casting sand</m>, if they can find any.<hr/></ab>

<ab>The usual <del><fr>bo</fr></del> good one is <m>the one which is
found in a <env>vineyard</env> near <pl>Puy David</pl></m>, but the one
which is most excellent is <m>the one from the <pl>Touch</pl>, near
<pl>Sainct Michel</pl> &amp; toward <pl>Blagnac</pl>, in a
<env>vineyard that is quite high up</env></m>. The latter is thinner
&amp; a little fatter than the other, &amp; better for small works. It
does not want to be reheated too much.</ab>
