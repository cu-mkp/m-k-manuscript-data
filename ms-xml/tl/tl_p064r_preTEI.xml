<head>Working neatly</head>

<ab>Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But
next, having made your design carefully, keep the place of shadows for
them alone, &amp; also separately that of lights &amp; highlights,
without layering one color all over &amp; then highlighting or else shading
on it. And in this way, you further your work, economize your colors
&amp; work neatly. Which is the reason that, the colors not being
muddled nor mixed together, they do not die &amp; you soften the colors
better, since they are not so thick.</ab>

<head><m>Fatty oil</m></head>

<ab>It is not good for working with colors because it makes them thick,
&amp; as difficult to work as <m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m>. Therefore use the
<m>clearest <pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> that you can, &amp; the
freshest.</ab>

One softens in the same way on <m>oiled paper</m> as on <m>wood</m>. But
it is easier to soften on <m>canvas</m>, because the softening must be

<head><m>Vermilion</m></head>

<ab>One ought not to keep it in <m>water</m> when <del>tempered</del>
<add>ground</add> with <m>oil</m> for it loses its color. It is better
to choose whitish <m>vermilion</m> than dark &amp; blackish. For
<m>vermilion</m> is commonly mixed with a little <m>lake</m>, without
which it would hardly be different from <m>minium</m>. But the pale 
casts more vivacity than the dark. It is not desiccative, &amp;
for this reason one mixes in <m>calcined <fr>cristallin</fr></m>.</ab>

<head><m>Oil</m> colors in <m>water</m></head>

<ab>Commonly, after grinding them one puts a
<del><fr>fo</fr></del> piece of <m>tin leaf</m> on top, &amp; one puts
them in <m>water</m> to prevent them from drying out. But this is more
appropriate for <m>ceruse</m>, <m>lead white</m>, <m>minium</m>, &amp;
<m>massicot</m> than for the others, for <m>lake</m> dies there &amp;
loses its color, also <m>azure</m>, <m>vermilion</m>.</ab>

<head>Double layer</head>

<ab><m>Ver<add>digris</add></m> does not die, &amp; thus does not need
to be layered twice. But <m>lake</m> &amp; others, &amp; principally
flesh colors, <del>the</del> require two layers. Colors hardly change
when they are dry.</ab>
