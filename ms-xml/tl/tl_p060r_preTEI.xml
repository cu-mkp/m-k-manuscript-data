<head>Neat work</head>

<ab>When you are working, make sure not to stir up dust, &amp; when you
leave your work, cover it in order that the said dust will not fall upon it.
Also layer your colors as thinly as you can, for if they are thick you
will be not be able to soften them thoroughly.</ab>

Also do not layer color on color if they are not similar, such as white
on black, but rather flesh color on flesh color, &amp; thus with the
others. And leave blank the space for shadow or a different color.
<del><fr>Ains</fr></del> In this way, layering each manner of color
on the imprimatura itself, they will not die &amp; you will work
neatly.</ab></div>

<ab><m><pa>Walnut</pa> oil</m> extracted like <m>peeled
<pa>almonds</pa></m> is very white. The one of <m><pa>palma
christi</pa></m>. And when the <m>oil</m> has a little body, the
colors soften in it. For if the <m>oil</m> is too clear, the colors run &amp;
do not have bond, even those that hardly have any body. <m>Fatty
oil</m> that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for <m>varnish</m>.
The <m>oil</m> is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as
<m>common varnish</m>. <m>Oils</m> do not dry as quickly in cold
countries as in hot countries. <m>Oil</m> <env>exposed to the sun</env>
is clarified well. But it fattens, if you put in <m>ceruse</m> or
<m>lead filings</m> or <m>lead white</m> or <m>calcined pulverized
<del><fr>p</fr></del> glass</m>. To avoid this, put the <tl>vial</tl> in
<m>clear water</m>.</ab>

<ab>Colors in <m>oil</m>, once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the
second colors; to prevent this, breathe on them &amp; the color will
take there.</ab>
