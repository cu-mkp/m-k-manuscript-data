<ab>since the two <tl><m>bones</m></tl> are joined,
<del><fr>co</fr></del> cut them evenly all around, &amp; make notches
<del><fr>e</fr></del> around it in different places which cross over the
joining of the two <tl><m>bones</m></tl>, in order to recognize well the
place of the first joining. Or else, with little <tl>shards of
<m>wood</m></tl>, pierce them, or <del><fr>ma</fr></del> coat the
joinings with some <m>clay</m>, &amp; dry. Press <del>between them</del>
your <tl><bp>hands</bp> joined between your<bp> two </bp>knees</tl>;
&amp; not with a <tl>press</tl>, because the <tl><m>bones</m></tl> would
burst. Mold also at your leisure &amp; two or three times, until you see
that it is well pressed tightly together &amp; well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, <fr>ponce</fr> with some
<m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m>, for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with <m>oil</m> &amp; with <m><pa>willow</pa>
charcoal powder</m> &amp; with a <tl>brush</tl>, to make it dull. Guard
against your medal being too greasy or <m>oily</m>, when you mold in
<tl><m><al>cuttlefish</al> bone</m></tl>. When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some <tl><m>bone</m></tl>. And, cast moderately hot,
something you will know when the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> is about to change
its <del>good</del> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes
the <tl><m>bone</m></tl> red. The <ms>proportion</ms> of <m>lead</m>
&amp; <m>tin</m> is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out, &amp; of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or
four grooves, <del>and make</del> &amp; direct these grooves to the
place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like
directly on the head, for this attracts the <m>metal</m> &amp; feeds
the figure best. Shake your <tl>frame</tl> a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <m>Tin</m> that is too
hot burns the <tl><m>bone</m></tl>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out <del><fr>du mo</fr></del>hot from the <tl>mold</tl>, it risks
breaking.
