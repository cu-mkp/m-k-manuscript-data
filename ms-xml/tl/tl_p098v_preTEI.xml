<head>Salted <pa>artichokes</pa></head>

<ab>One puts them whole &amp; not too ripe in a <tl>firkin</tl> that one
fills with <m>brine</m>. Then, one serves them <ms><tmp>all
year</tmp></ms> among salads, raw with <m>oil</m> &amp; <m>vinegar</m>,
for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test
your <m>brine</m> with an <m>egg</m>, for if it is good &amp; strong
enough, the <m>egg</m> will float on top. If not, it is not strong
enough and would not preserve the <m>fruits</m>.</ab>

<head><al>Birds</al></head>

<ab>Which have been fed by the <tl>rod</tl> do not whistle among the
company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them to whistle well, one needs to take them from the nest before they can
see &amp; cover them with <m>down</m> or a <m><al>hare</al> skin</m>. Thus,
having not seen their father and known his voice, they better learn the whistle
that one teaches them.</ab>

<head>Founding</head>

<ab>The <m>putty</m> is made of <m>burnt earth</m> which has

in <del><ill/></del> which one has founded. One grinds it on a big
<tl><m>stone</m></tl>, &amp; with this one makes the
<del>cope of</del> first coat of the cope of
bells, where there are letters &amp; works, &amp; <del><fr>le</fr></del>
only needs to be reheated in the flame of <tl><m>straw</m></tl>, and molds very
neatly.</ab>

<ab>The <m>earth</m> which molds <fr>en noyau</fr> is subject to making
it porous, if you do not rub well with a <tl>brush</tl> or your
<tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> the piece to be molded, which should be well
<m>oiled</m>. And do it coat by coat, &amp; not all at once.</ab>
