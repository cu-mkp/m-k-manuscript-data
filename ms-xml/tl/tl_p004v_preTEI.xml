<head><m>Black varnish</m> for <wp>sword guard</wp>, bands for trunks,
&amp;c</head>

<ab>Take <m><pa>linseed</pa> oil</m> or more cheaply, <m><pa>walnut</pa>
oil</m>, and rid it of grease with <m><pa>garlic</pa></m> &amp;
<del><m><pa>onions</pa></m></del> <add><mark>+</mark><m><pa>hogâ€™s
fennel</pa></m>, some also add <m>bread crusts</m></add>, which you will
boil in it for a <ms><tmp>good quarter of an hour</tmp></ms>. Next, put
in one <ms>lb</ms> of the <m>oil</m> thus boiled <ms>the size of a <pa>walnut</pa></ms> of <m>black
pitch</m> &amp; a <ms>double <bp>handful</bp></ms> of <m><pa>grains of wheat</pa></m>, without
removing the <m><pa>garlic</pa></m> &amp; <m><pa>onions</pa></m>, and let
it boil together for a <ms><tmp>good quarter of an hour</tmp></ms>. And
when the <m>pitch</m> is well melted &amp; when the <m>oil</m> has body,
you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your
<m>iron</m> over a low <m>charcoal</m> fire &amp; apply your
<m>varnish</m> with a <tl>feather</tl> or a <tl>brush</tl>.
And when you see that it no longer <m>smokes</m>, it is done and your
<m>varnish</m> is dry.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

For excellent <m>black varnish</m>, add two or three <ms>paternoster
beads</ms> of <m>jet</m> among the rest.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

Some consider <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> better.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

If there is a lot of <m>varnish</m>, it needs to boil for at least
<ms><tmp>half a day</tmp></ms>, for it is better the more it boils. It
is dangerous if it catches fire, if it goes over the top, and is
hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a <env>courtyard</env> or an
<env>open space</env>.</ab>

 <ab margin="left-middle" render="tall">

In five or six <ms>lb</ms> of <m>oil</m>, one must put one <ms>lb</ms>
of <m>galipot</m>, which costs 4 <cn>sous</cn>, &amp; some
<m>peeled <pa>garlic</pa> cloves</m>. This <m>varnish</m> in and of
itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.</ab>

<ab>Take <m>varnish of <pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> &amp; mix in
<m>soot black</m> or <m>lampblack</m>, &amp; without fire it will mix in
by itself. Varnish with a <tl>brush</tl> &amp; it will soon be
dry. <m>Turpentine varnish</m> will be quite good, but it does not dry
as soon.</ab>

<ab>Take <m><pa>linseed</pa> oil</m> or <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>
&amp;, in place of <m>black pitch</m>, you will put in a little
<m>pitch resin</m>, &amp; it needs to be cooked in the fashion of <m>black
varnish</m> on fire. And for applying it, heat your <m>iron</m> &amp;
give it only one layer of <m>varnish</m>, &amp; when it no longer
<m>smokes</m>, it is dry. Next engrave with a <tl><m>steel</m> point</tl>
whatever you want. Next <add>take</add> <m>salt</m> &amp;
<m>verdigris</m> &amp; mix as much of one as of the other in <m>quite
strong vinegar</m> &amp; leave it for xx4 <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms>
before using it, &amp; all will be tempered. Next spread some of this
liquor or sauce on the engraved object with a <tl>sponge</tl></ab>
