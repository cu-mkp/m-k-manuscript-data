<head><m>Latten</m></head>

<ab>It is very capricious to cast. It must be cast very hot. And to better
achieve your goal, throw on it some <m>sal ammoniac</m> to thin it. Alloy
it as well with a little <m>red copper</m> and, when you want to cast, a
little <m>tin</m> to make it run better. It always leaves a tail like
<m>melted glass</m>. It does not require as long a gate as
others.</ab></div>

<head>Molding</head>

<ab>It is only good that it die down a little on the outside &amp;
nevertheless be red on the inside, for when it comes out of the fire,
the air &amp; vehement exhalations of fire do not receive the cast so
well.</ab></div>

<ab><m>Silver</m> needs a longish gate. For <m>gold</m> it does not
matter. <add><m>Silver</m>, when soldering, tolerates the <m>water</m>
one throws on it. But <m>gold</m> would spatter, &amp; <del>needs

<head>Reinforcing flowers and delicate things</head>

<ab>For flowers &amp; <del>delicate things</del>
<corr><del>&amp;</del></corr> herbage, one does not use <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m> but <m>melted

<head><pa>Strawberries</pa></head>

<ab>The leaves are cast separately &amp; then are joined with
<m>solder</m>. And because the <pa>strawberry</pa> fruit is cast solid,
&amp; by that means is heavy, and the <m>tin</m> stem which is delicate
will not be able to hold it up without soon breaking, one makes the
stems with <m>latten wire</m> &amp; then one <m>solders</m> &amp; joins
them.</ab>
