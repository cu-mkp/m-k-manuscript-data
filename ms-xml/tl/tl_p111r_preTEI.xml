<head>Reheating <tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>The <tl>frames</tl> readily dry out &amp; do not reheat. For
reheating is actually <del>for the second time</del> to redden &amp;
inflame the <tl>molds</tl> in the fire, and drying out is to let the
<tl>molds</tl> dry themselves or to make their dampness evaporate by
placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one.

<ab>

It is good to reheat in it the <tl>molds for casting <m>latten</m></tl>,
for this <del><fr>g</fr></del><m>yellow filth</m>, which
appears nevertheless to refill the <tl>molds</tl>, casts very neatly,
being of the same nature.</ab>

<ab>When it is melted, it is good to throw in a little <m>fine tin</m>,
for this makes it run.</ab>

<ab>This one, moistened &amp; well beaten &amp; kneaded as you know, is
necessary for you to make the contour for containing your
<tl>molds</tl>. But take heed that it is not too soft, but rather as if
half dry, that <del><fr>il</fr></del>it<comment rid="c_111r_01"/> does
<sn>not attach to your <tl><bp>hands</bp></tl></sn>, because otherwise
it would attach to your work. Always keep it <env>in a damp place</env>,
and make holes in it, and fill them with <m>water</m> to keep it
fresh.</ab>

<ab>You also need to have provision of different sizes,
according to the <tl>molds</tl> that you want to make; <ms>thick
like cord, smaller <ill/></ms>, &amp; <ms>thin <del><fr>p</fr></del>,
like the thick strings of a <mu>spinet</mu>, for the small works</ms>. Once <del><fr>de</fr></del> reheated, you
make <tl>clamps</tl> from it to close the
<tl>molds</tl>, &amp; points, like needles of different lengths,
according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded &amp; keep it
held down. <tl>Needles</tl> would not be good for this because their points have to be empty &amp; of the same thickness
throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as
you have need of. <m>Iron wire is firmer</m> than <m>that of
latten</m>.</ab>
