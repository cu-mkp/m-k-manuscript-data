<caption>of <m>leather</m></caption>

<ab>Make a <tl>small sheath of <m>plain leather, such as <al>cow</al> or
morocco</m></tl>, somewhat thick, <ms>as tall as three
<bp>fingers</bp></ms>, sewn like the finger of a glove &amp; <ms>large
enough that two <bp>fingertips</bp> can fit inside</ms> &amp; which, at
the tip, which is a little puckered, has a round hole <ms>as large as a
double <cn>liard</cn></ms>. Take <del>one</del> two similar
<tl><m><pa>boxwood</pa></m> balls</tl>, &amp; let one be hollow &amp;
open with a round hole on one side only so that the <tl>thimble</tl> can
fit inside. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your
<tl><m>leather</m> sheath</tl> on the <tl>table</tl> with the
<tl>ball</tl> that is not hollow. Pass a <tl>stick</tl> inside the
<tl><m>leather</m> sheath</tl> to show that there is nothing there, also
show the full <tl>ball</tl>, and hold the one which is hollow &amp; has
the <tl>thimble</tl> inside it by your <tl><bp>little &amp; ring
fingers</bp></tl>, and do this with your <tl><bp>right hand</bp></tl>
with which you are holding the <tl>stick</tl>. Next, you take your
<tl><m>leather</m> sheath</tl> &amp; place it over the hollow
<tl>ball</tl> which is in your <bp>fingers</bp>, &amp; making it seem as
if you are putting some <m><la>oribus</la> powder</m> over it, you put
back the <tl><m>leather</m> mold</tl><comment>c_036r_01</comment> that
contains the <tl>ball</tl> with the <tl>thimble</tl> on the
<tl>table</tl>, then you take the full &amp; solid <tl>ball</tl>
remaining on the <tl>table</tl>, and command it to enter from under the
<tl>table</tl> into the <tl><m>leather</m> sheath</tl>. Then, when lifting
the <m>leather</m>, the <tl>ball</tl> seems to be the same,
although it is the hollow one. Then cover it again &amp; command it to
become invisible. And then, lifting the <tl>sheath</tl> while pressing
it, you will remove it &amp; the <tl>ball</tl> along with it; &amp;
<del><fr>l</fr></del>putting it aside with the <tl>sheath</tl>,
<del>&amp; a <ill/></del> in its place will be found a <tl>thimble</tl>
for the ladies whose bottom hurts, that is to say, the bottom of the
needle.</ab>
