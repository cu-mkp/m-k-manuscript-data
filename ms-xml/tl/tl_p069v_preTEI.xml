The sand near my area is very excellent. But one ought
to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been hardly
put to work. For it dries out after having been cast several times &amp; is
lean &amp; has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any
thickness, it is necessary that your substance of copper be very
hot so that it penetrates &amp; runs. Some mix lead in this
melt, but it is for large works &amp; not for small ones.

Sand from oxen feet, burned twice &amp; finely ground,
melts more neatly with copper than sand that I have seen,
&amp; without crust. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and
f with a thickness as delicate as a knife
blade or a card. And it was hollow on one side, opposite the
relief, which was on other side.

It is necessary that lean sands be more moistened than
others, namely with magistra or good pure wine or
boiled wine with elm tree roots &amp; similar things.
But very fine sands, like burned linen, which is fatty &amp;
soft on its own, want to be applied dry.

All moistened sand wants to be strongly beaten &amp; stirred, to
be ground finely &amp; to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself
when it is bathed.

The olive oil that some mix in with beaten egg
glair makes it become porous.

Sand of calcined glass withstands several fusions, but there
is nothing like the first ones. It also becomes porous.

Latten comes out well on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is
good to mix it with a little copper, like a quarter
part, with the substance of skillets.

Founders do cast frames up to 30 or 40 lb,
but not more.



It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for
releasing Il because it crumbles. It is good that
it be alloyed with some fatty thing which has bond such as molded
tripoli or ab burned felt or sal
ammoniac or tripoli &amp; similar things.
