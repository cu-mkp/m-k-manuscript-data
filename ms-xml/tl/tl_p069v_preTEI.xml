<ab>The <m>sand <env>near my area</env></m> is very excellent. But one ought
to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been hardly
put to work. For it dries out after having been cast several times &amp; is
lean &amp; has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any
thickness, it is necessary that your substance of <m>copper</m> be very
hot so that it penetrates &amp; runs. Some mix <m>lead</m> in this
melt, but it is for large works &amp; not for small ones.</ab></div>

<div id="p069r_2" part="y" continued="yes">
<ab><m>Sand from <al>oxen</al> feet, burned twice &amp; finely ground</m>,
melts more neatly with <m>copper</m> than <m>sand</m> that I have seen,
&amp; without crust. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and
<del><fr>f</fr></del> with a thickness as delicate as a <tl>knife</tl>
blade or a <tl>card</tl>. And it was hollow on one side, opposite the
relief, which was on other side.</ab>

<ab>It is necessary that <m>lean sands</m> be more moistened than
others, namely with <m><fr>magistra</fr></m> or good <m>pure wine</m> or
<m>boiled wine with <pa>elm tree</pa> roots</m> &amp; similar things.
But <m>very fine sands</m>, like <m>burned linen</m>, which is fatty &amp;
soft on its own, want to be applied dry.</ab>

<ab>All <m>moistened sand</m> wants to be strongly beaten &amp; stirred, to
be ground finely &amp; to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself
when it is bathed.</ab>

<ab>The <m><pa>olive</pa> oil</m> that some mix in with <m>beaten egg
glair</m> makes it become porous.</ab>

<ab><m>Sand of calcined glass</m> withstands several fusions, but there
is nothing like the first ones. It also becomes porous.</ab>

<ab><m>Latten</m> comes out well on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is
good to mix it with a little <m>copper</m>, like a <ms>quarter
part</ms>, with the <m>substance of skillets</m>.</ab>

<ab><pro>Founders</pro> do cast <tl>frames</tl> up to 30 or 40 <ms>lb</ms>,
but not more.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for
releasing <del>It</del> because it crumbles. It is good that
it be alloyed with some fatty thing which has bond such as <m>molded
tripoli</m> or <del><fr>ab</fr></del> <m>burned felt</m> or <m>sal
ammoniac</m> or <m>tripoli</m> &amp; similar things.</ab>
