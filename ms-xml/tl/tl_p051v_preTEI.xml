<ab>which is different from that of the <pro>printers</pro>, one needs
to boil <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> or, even better <m><pa>linseed</pa>
oil</m>, for a <tmp>long time</tmp>. &amp; having boiled for a <tmp>long
time</tmp>, you will put in <m><pa>garlic</pa></m> &amp; <m>bread
crusts</m> to rid it of grease &amp; leave again to boil thoroughly,
then finally you put in one <ms>part</ms> of <m>lampblack</m> that you
have previously ground on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl> with <m>oil</m> .
And finally you will mix everything <add>as long as</add> &amp; until
you see that the <tl>plate</tl> prints well. <del>Which</del> And when
you have spread the <m>ink</m> on it, wipe the <tl>plates</tl> well with
the surface of a <tl>piece of <m>white paper</m></tl>. &amp; do this
until the <tl><m>paper</m></tl> looks clean and then print. If you were
to wipe the <tl>plates</tl> with a <tl><m>linen</m>cloth</tl>, it would
remove the <m>ink</m>. <m><pa>Linseed</pa> oil</m> thickens while
boiling &amp; becomes like a <m>varnish</m> &amp; is in danger of
catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make sure it is in an
<env>open space</env> or in a <env>place where the flame cannot cause
damage</env>. Some burn <m>tartar</m> until it is black &amp; grind it
with <m>non-boiled <pa>linseed</pa> oil</m>, or <m><pa>walnut</pa>
oil</m> which others find to be better. This <m>black</m> is beautiful,
but the <m>lamp smoke</m> kind is blacker. When you want to print
<del><fr>fr</fr></del>, take with your <tl><bp>fingertip</bp></tl> of
the said <m>black moderately thick</m>, the whole <tl>plate</tl> having
first been cleaned in <m>lye</m> as said, then, rub it with the surface
of a <tl>piece of <m>white paper</m></tl> until the
<tl><m>paper</m></tl> remains white &amp; do not touch it with the
<bp>bare hand</bp> <del>because</del> but with a <tl>piece
of<m>paper</m></tl> applied across it. &amp; having cleaned the
<tl>plate</tl> perfectly, <del><fr>mi</fr></del> rub again with a
<tl>piece of <m>paper</m></tl>, fold the edges &amp; sides. Next, take a
<tl>small smooth table</tl> &amp; on this a <tl>piece of
<m>felt</m></tl>, then a few <tl>sheets of <m>paper</m></tl> &amp;
finally the one you want to print on, which should be moistened between
two <tl>wet napkins</tl>. And on this <m>sheet</m> put your
<tl>plate</tl> then another piece of <tl><m>paper</m></tl>, &amp;
finally another<tl> <m>felt</m></tl>. Then pass between the
<tl>rollers</tl>. And you can print a dozen pieces consecutively by
always charging the <tl>plate</tl> with <m>ink</m> &amp; cleaning it as
have done. But if you stop printing, the rest of the <m>ink</m> will dry
in the grooves of the <tl>plate</tl>. Thus you will have to let it boil
in <m>lye</m> or <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, as already said, to clean it. The
<tl>rollers</tl> must not be too loose.</ab>
