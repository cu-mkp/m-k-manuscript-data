They mold in two <tl><m><al>cuttlefish</al> bones</m></tl> their animal
or other work that they have either already made or modelled in
<m>wax</m> &amp; cast in <m>lead</m>. Once it is well imprinted in the

two <tl><m>bones</m></tl> a <tl><m>paper</m></tl>, &amp; join the
<tl><m>bones</m></tl> &amp; cast. The work comes out split in half. And
then, with <del><fr>ch</fr></del> a <tl><fr>chaple</fr></tl>, they
hollow out as finely as they please the two halves cast in <m>gold</m>
or <m>silver</m>, and then <m>solder</m> or braze them.</ab>
