<del>If you have</del> To bring a <wp>cannon</wp>, one needs a hundred
<pro>pioneers</pro> or more to flatten the tracks by levelling ditches
&amp; others obstacles, such as <pa>trees</pa>, <m>stone</m> mounds
&amp; similar things to make gabions on the way. Once one is close to
the place one wants to batter, the <pro>gunner</pro> goes <tmp>at
night</tmp> to reconnoiter the most convenient place to mount the
battery<lb/></ab>
