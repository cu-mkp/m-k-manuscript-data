But make sure, through the gate, that it is red at the bottom &amp; that
nothing appears black.</ab>

<ab>Having <del><fr>d</fr></del><comment rid="c_132v_02"/> passed it through <m>vinegar</m> &amp;
reddened it in the fire, I had it finely ground on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>,
until no roughness was <sn>perceived on the <tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl></sn>. Then,
I wet it with <m>very good vinegar</m> &amp; 
left it there <del><fr>a</fr></del><comment rid="c_132v_01"/> two or three <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>, stirring
it <ms>several times each <tmp>day</tmp></ms>. Finally, I boiled it
&amp; reddened <del>in</del> the <tl>pot</tl> &amp;
<m><la>crocum</la></m> all together in the <tl><fr>four Ã 
vent</fr></tl>. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that
can be pulverized very finely between the <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl>. I
put some in the <m>sand</m>, <del><fr>a</fr></del> <ms>half</ms> as much as
<m>feather alum</m>. I tempered the <m>sand</m> quite thinly &amp; molded
out of it a <al>very small female lizard</al>, which molded very neatly &amp;
delicately &amp; very finely. The <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m> does not
render the <tl>mold</tl> harder, but it firms it. And when your
<tl>mold</tl> is soft &amp; fatty <sn>when scraping it with the
<tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl>, it is a sign that the <m><la>crocum</la></m> is
good, very fine, &amp; well prepared</sn>. The quantity cannot spoil the
<tl>mold</tl>, because it is a friend to <m>gold</m>. And I believe that
<m>silver</m> would come out well. And that the <tl>mold</tl>, through
this means, does not crack. <emph>Make it from <m>filings of
needles</m>.</emph></ab>

I have tried to make it so the <tl>molds</tl> where it is mixed do not crack
during reheating &amp; thus do not make flashing.</ab>

It is better made with <m>distilled vinegar</m>.</ab>

One can put some amongst the <tl>molds</tl>, where you want to cast
<m>silver</m>, for it firms the <tl>molds</tl>, and <sn>you will find it so,
by scraping a little harder than the other where there is none</sn>. It molds
very neatly.</ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

This one is appropriate for all <tl>molds</tl> &amp; keeps them from
breaking &amp; bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands
several casts. The one of <m>steel fillings &amp; needles</m> is redder
&amp; better.</ab>
