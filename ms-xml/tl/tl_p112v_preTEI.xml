Take a <tl>fine needle of <m>steel</m></tl>, &amp; which is the sharpest
possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the <tl>points

roughness does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a thickish
<tl>point of <m>iron</m></tl> in thick places &amp; thin ones in thin
places. But heed as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
