ones, only <m>eau-de-vie</m>, which is done sooner.
When your animal is dead, take it out &amp; clean it carefully of its

<tl>needle</tl>, &amp; in its place &amp; its hole, put the <tl>point of

possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the <tl>points

<tl>point of <m>iron</m></tl> in thick places &amp; thin ones in thin
places. But heed as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
