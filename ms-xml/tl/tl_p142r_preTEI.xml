<ab>are not uncovered as much. But because the <al>crayfish</al> is
awkward to burn &amp; clean, one needs to uncover as much as one can,
especially the little legs until the end, for these are awkward &amp; if
they were not to be uncovered and you were to have to pull them, you
could break something in the <tl>mold</tl>. While uncovering with the
<tl>point of a knife</tl>, or even a <tl>burin</tl> or other<tl> appropriate
thing</tl>, clean very carefully the <m>sand</m> which will be in the joints
&amp; elsewhere with your <tl>little brushes</tl>. And if something gets
detached, attach it with <m>wax</m>, as said. And attach also the horns
in the same way. And make also the gate, along the end of the little
legs, with some <m>wax</m>. And fill the holes made by the <tl><m>iron
wire</m> point</tl> with it. And once everything is quite neat &amp; more
than half is uncovered, <m>oil</m> your <del><fr>ut</fr></del><comment rid="c_142r_03"/> <tl>mold</tl>
<del>&amp; <fr>nâ€™oubli</fr></del>, after having dipped the reverse in
<m>water</m>, &amp; do not forget to <m>oil</m> all the delicate parts
which are between the legs and the little pincers. Then, rub the
<al>crayfish</al> with <m>eau-de-vie</m>. And make your second cast,
having flattened the first <tl>mold</tl>, in order that the
<tl>clamps</tl> join better. Your <tl>mold</tl> must be wider on the
side that is imprinted than on the back. Do not open your <tl>mold</tl>
after the second cast unless it has been <m><tl>luted</tl></m> &amp; reheated
&amp; unless what is inside is burned. Do not forget to put
<m><la>crocum</la></m> among your <m>sand</m> when you mold <al>crayfish</al>,
for one needs to reheat strongly, &amp; the <m><la>crocum</la></m>
withstands marvelously. Molding a <al>crab</al> &amp; a
<al>crayfish</al>, it is<comment rid="c_142r_01"/> all the same. When you have uncovered
your <al>crayfish</al> on one side, only delay making the seond cast as little you can, for <del><fr>el</fr></del> <al>crayfish</al> dry
<del><fr>se</fr></del> out. It is not just about uncovering the
<al>crayfish</al> well, in such a way that you see an entire half, but
take heed that your <tl>mold</tl> itself, in which you uncover, releases
well, for even if the <al>crayfish</al> were well burned, you
<del><fr>despoui</fr></del> would not be able to open your <tl>mold</tl>
without breaking.</ab>
