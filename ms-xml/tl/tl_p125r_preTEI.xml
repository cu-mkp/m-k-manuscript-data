<ab>When you <del><fr>v</fr></del> mold something to cast <m>wax</m> in it, you
mold in <m>plaster</m> alone, reheated after being pulverized.
For, once reheated in <m>stone</m>, the outside is cooked &amp; the
inside stays almost raw. <m>Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but the one
that, being tempered, is white</m> &amp; sets very
quickly, is good. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm &amp; hard
after having set, but its takes <tmp>longer</tmp> to do so. One needs to know the
nature of each. <del>If you</del> You will never mold very neatly if
<corr><del>not</del></corr> you do not temper, very thin &amp;
liquid, your <m>plaster</m> or your <m>sand of <fr>noyau</fr></m>. Temper it
<del>immediately</del> quickly after it has been reheated.</ab>

If you mold with <m>plaster</m> <del><fr>crud</fr></del> alone, reheat it
nevertheless as said. One needs to <m>oil</m> well the first
<tl>mold</tl>. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready,
soak it for a long time in <m>water</m>. And if it does not want to
release, soak it in <m>hot water</m>, for <m>cold water</m> hardens it.</ab>

<ab>The <pro>workers</pro> from <pl>Damascus</pl> or from

<m>ore</m>, <m>iron</m> from <m>steel</m>. And, from this
first <m>steel</m>, first melted from its <m>ore</m>, they
cast <wp>scimitar</wp> blades in <m>sand</m> <del><fr>sab</fr></del> which afterward cut the other <m>iron</m> without any difficulty,
because any <m>melted iron</m> is harder than <m>soft iron</m>
beaten from pigs &amp; bars. Thus is the <m>steel</m> of <wp>scimitars</wp>, but
it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts <del><fr>b</fr></del> a <wp>scimitar</wp>,
one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in
<m>sand</m>.</ab>
