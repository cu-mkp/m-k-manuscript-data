<head>Molding vases in several pieces</head>

<ab><pro>Goldsmiths who work in large wares and plate</pro> get whatever
<m>wooden</m> forms they please turned on a <tl>lathe</tl>. And then,
with some <m>wax</m>, they model on top masks, festoons, and whatever
they please. And next they mold in three, in four, or several
pieces.</ab>

<head>Molding a <al>fly</al></head>

<ab><al>Large flies</al> can be molded &amp; <del><fr>g</fr></del><comment rid="c_149v_02"/> made
by casting. But one needs <del><fr>par d</fr></del> to anoint underneath
their wings with <m><pa>wheat</pa> oil</m>, which dries quickly and
fortifies them &amp; gives them a little thickness. The same is done to
<al>butterflies</al>, <al>cicadas</al>, <al>grasshoppers</al> &amp;
similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some
leaf or bouquet. The others are <bp>made by hand</bp> with a <m>very
thin silver sheet</m>. One ought not to keep them once dead,
because they dry out and their legs break.<comment rid="c_149v_01"/></ab>

<ab margin="left-middle">

<m><pa>Wheat</pa> oil</m> is put underneath delicate things to render
them more rigid &amp; firm &amp; to make them hold their natural
position. Because being weak &amp; delicate, the <m>tempered sand</m>, weighing down
their tops, would change their form.</ab></div>

<ab>They have very thin wings, &amp; if they are large &amp; dry and
their wings extended, one would need a very large <tl>mold</tl> &amp; it
would not be certain that the <m>metal</m> would run sufficiently. Thus,
when you want to mold them, choose the medium-sized ones &amp; make the
pose <del><fr>qu</fr></del> so that they have their wings half folded. Because in
this way they will come out better, but support the side of the wings
with <m>wax</m>, as you know, to feed the cast well.</ab>
