<head>Against <md>nose bleed</md> and for <m>dyeing</m></head>

<ab><tl>Pestle</tl> some <m><pa>sorrel</pa></m> or <m><pa><la>lapathum

<m><al>dragon</al>’s blood</m>, and apply it <del><fr>de</fr></del> to
the <md><bp>forehead</bp> of the one who bleeds</md>. This herb is a strong

<head>Beautiful <pa>artichokes</pa></head>

<ab>One needs to prune them<ms><tmp> every year</tmp></ms> so that only
one stalk is left, &amp; water them thoroughly. <del><fr>L</fr></del>
Also replant some <ms><tmp>every year</tmp></ms>, for the second

<head>Planting trees</head>

<ab>One says that rarely a tree planted on <tmp><pn>Saint Paul</pn>’s
day</tmp> fails to take, &amp; for covering the bark, <al>cow</al> dung
is very appropriate, for it is not undone in the rain like earth.</ab>

<head><pro>Merchant</pro></head>

<ab>Those who sell <m>velvet</m> &amp; <del><fr>es</fr></del> other
stuffs by retail do not make double-entry books because selling by
retail &amp; in detail it would be too much effort for them. They have
only their sales book &amp; their account book. But those who sell in
bulk &amp; those who traffic in <m><pa>pastel woad</pa></m> have
double-entry books.</ab>

<head>Scarlets</head>

<ab>Because one <ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms> costs seven or eight
<cn>lb.</cn> to <m>dye</m>, they use <m>cloths</m> worth seven or eight
<cn>francs</cn> an <ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms>. But whoever wants something
beautiful <del><fr>se la</fr></del> should buy <m>white cloth</m> worth
fifteen <cn>francs</cn> an <ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms> &amp; have it <m>dyed</m> with
<m>pure scarlet <pa>pastel woad</pa></m> &amp; a little <m>cochineal</m>.
<m>Black cloth</m> is thin so that the <m>dyeing</m> is
inexpensive.</ab>
