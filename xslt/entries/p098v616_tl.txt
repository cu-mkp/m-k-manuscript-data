Salted artichokes

One puts them whole & not too ripe in a firkin that one
fills with brine. Then one serves them all
year, among salads, raw with oil & vinegar,
for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test
your brine with an egg for if it is good & and strong
enough, the egg will float on top. If not, it is not strong
enough and would not preserve the fruits.
