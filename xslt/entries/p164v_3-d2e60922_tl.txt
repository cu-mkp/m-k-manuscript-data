Molds



Even though you cast in lead, the molds want to be well
dried, especially when they are large, and one needs to redden them on
the outside & keep them in continuous heat, until they no longer
smoke from inside. Do not place them to reheat at different
moments, but continue once you have started. And do not place them
to cool in the cold, with for they would break,
but leave them to become lukewarm near the fire, & when they are
when they are still of such a heat as you have noticed before putting
your finger in the hole, cast. And when the
mold is large, it needs more time to reheat & dry & one
needs to cast hotter.
