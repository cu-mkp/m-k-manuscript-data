Excellent secret for molding hollow and very delicately infine
gold

Cast with your aforementioned sand your animal and lizard
or other thing with silver billon & it will come out very
neat. E But take heed to mold it hollow, or at least leave a
small hole, in its mouth or in another place. Next,
gild it with fine gold, as uniform as it will be possible
for you, three or four or five times, & until your gold has
the thickness of a piece of paper or something similar,
& all the scales will always show equally. Next, put it in good
aquafortis, which, by this hole, will corrode the billon
& the gold will remain hollow & light &
wonderful.
