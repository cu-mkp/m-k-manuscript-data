Gilding with silver

One needs to prepare the guards & whiten them with a
lince file, a little coarser
for than for gold. And one makes them pass beyond
grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
silver foil, then separate it with a knife, next apply
it to the guard, with a smalltweezers
& a small burnisher. And then reheat & apply until they
are all gilt with silver. Next one needs to cover them for the
third time, with the doubled foil as has been said, then burnish them
very well & with force, not with the bloodstone, but with a
strong burnisher. Just as the burnisher ought not to
burnish gold.
