<ab>The end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six
sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which
are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the
sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture
of the nail. The best way is to apply some <m>resin</m> or <m>glue</m>
but the <m>resin</m> is better. And the best is when the end is tightly
set and so hot when set that powdered <m>resin</m> on the end melts, in
that way it doesn't fall and can't be undone unless it is put in
fire.</ab>

<ab>Hilts are of different types:

Ornate

Guttered which is with round mouldings

<m>Pearled</m>

Scarfed when the bands are crosswise

Onioned which is with a flat head

In the King's manner, fully covered </ab>

<ab>The <pro>furbishers</pro> buy them by dozens, the dozen of full ones

of the art.</ab>

<ab>They buy scabbards' <m>wood</m> pieces which are wholly made of
<m>beech wood</m>, a hundred for 15 or 20 or 30 sols, depending on how
far they are made.</ab>

<ab>Theses <m>wood</m> pieces are thus called estelles, and have to be
very clean and without any knots and are one finger thick.</ab>

<ab>Then the <pro>furbisher</pro> puts them on a small bench, called a
scabbard bench and with a small <m>iron</m> tool similar to the
<pro>joiners</pro>' bench, they maintain it firmly. Then with a plane,
which is like a two-handled knife, they work the <m>wood</m> piece from
the top, then use the <pro>joyner</pro>'s plane to flatten it more.
Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a</ab>
