Portraits in <m>Wax</m></head>

<ab>

If you do not mix your <m>wax</m> with any color <m>dye</m>, and if you
paint some colors on the <m>wax</m>, these colors would fade if you cast
it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly
with spirits diluted with hot <m>water</m>. If your representations are
varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to
remove this <m>varnish</m> which sticks to the mold. When the
<m>varnish</m> is removed, your mold is very clean. If your
representation is set on <m>wood</m>, it is necessary to pour very hot
melted <m>wax</m> on the <m>wood,</m> otherwise the mold sticks to the
<m>wood</m>. It is much better to mix your white <m>wax</m> with
<m>white lead</m> than <m>ceruse</m>, because <m>white lead</m> is
whiter and more firm.</ab>

Chasing tool</head>

<ab>

If a chasing tool has passed through any part of the representation, it
is necessary to rework the whole thing and follow it all again.
Otherwise it would look like an additional piece.</ab>

<m>Fish glue</m></head>

<ab>

Beat it very finely and thinly on a well-cleaned anvil, then dilute your
<m>glue</m> with <m>spirits</m>, put the mixture on hot <m>ashes</m>,
and on a low fire, it will melt very soon. If the <m>glue</m> is not
strong and thick enough, add <m>spirits</m> in greater quantity. Do not
melt it in a fatty <m>pot</m>, but in a new <m>pot</m> if possible. It
melts on fire and dries very quickly on fire. When your <m>glue</m> sets
on the work, heat it away from fire, it will stick very strongly. One
reworks flowers and delicate things made from <m>silver</m>,
<m>gold</m>, <m>tin</m> and other <m>metal</m> with this <m>glue</m>
which will not spoil your work.</ab>

<m>Tin</m> and <m>lead</m></head>

<ab>

They must be beaten out very finely and <m>tin</m> will not get brittle
or break, <m>lead</m> is a bit fatter. But that is why it is necessary
to reheat it under hot ashes, and to beat several leaves together.</ab>
