Molding very thin like bimbalotiers do

They mold in paper &
carton, for neither earth, sand, nor
metal would mold as neatly & would not receive. Or else they
engrave in stone from Istre the
principal side, & the reverse is of paper or
carton.







Reducing a round figure to a hollow form

You need to first mold it with some plaster, as said
before, & in the plaster cast in wax, from which will
come out a relief that you will repair very neatly, and
<-b-> model it as you fancy. And then you will model
this relief of wax again in plaster, or better yet, with
your wetted sand # like for noyau, & in the
latter, cast in some lead, & from this you will have a very
neat relief, & if it is not, repair on the cement or
otherwise, & take heed that it is always of good release. And
this one will always serve you well for making as many hollow forms as you
please, in this way. Place half of your figure of
lead, oiled & wetted with eau-de-vie according
to the above, in the clay slab, then mold this half with
some white plaster. Having set <-Next-> and having
well smoothed & flattened the plaster, take your
black wax mixed with sulfur, as is said, because it leaves
nothing in the mold & melts quicker. Wet it in warm
urine, & once softened enough, make an imprint with it
on the half of the lead figure, and <-it-> you will have a
very neat hollow form. Shape next the hollow wax form in a square shape, as
you please, with sufficient thickness & smooth it well on all sides,
& <-thus-> next, mold this hollowed wax,
imprinted on one part & flat & smooth on the other, in the same
fashion that you mold flat medals of wax or <-other->
metal en noyau. And the mold en noyau
will render in silver or such metal as pleases you
<-the m-> a similar figure to the wax, that is to
say flat & smooth on one side & hollow on the other. And having
cleaned & put this hollow form to be whitened, if it is silver,
you will be able to mix there some works of sugar,

#

having made a hole in your clay slab & having
<-en-> packed in it half of the figure of wax, 
a little oiled, to pull it out better.



Transparent wax is not good, but rather the one which has body,
to make an imprint well.

    




As you have molded with plaster & wax one half, you
can mold the other the same.
