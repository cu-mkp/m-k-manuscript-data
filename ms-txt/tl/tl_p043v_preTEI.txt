Varied and transmuted wine

Grate brazilwood very finely, put it to soak one or
two hours in clear water, then take this
tinted water & add to it some clear water & you
will make <-e-> wine as claret colored as you like. If you
please, put a drop of lemon or orange juice in it &
it will immediately turn white. It can be drunk without danger.









Pearls

It is said that pulverized talc blown into with a lamp
renders them thus.









Arquebusier

For firing your arquebus precisely, it is necessary that the end
of the breech be & come precisely to the edge of the touch-hole,
because in this manner the powder, without blowing, catches &
burns all at once & has more force & does not push back. On the
contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the
powder catches sooner in this place, makes it push back, &
blows, which a chambered arquebus clearly
shows, which pushes back more than another. And since the barrel is
thicker at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for
that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. And then, the
thickness of the barrel gains about one line over the caliber,
and the sight another. It would therefore be necessary to either
make the barrel all of one thickness or to raise the stock <-on-> at
the end & toward the muzzle, & sink it in & lower it
toward the breech. The weight of the
powder must be the third part of the ball.









Hail shot of the arquebus

If you want it to go together, set a
piece of felt or leather or
paper on top, according to the distance, & let
the<-e-> piece be made with a cutting-punch precisely
cut <-a-> according to the caliber of the arquebus.
