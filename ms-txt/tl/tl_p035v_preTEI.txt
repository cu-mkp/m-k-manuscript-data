For preventing someone from eating a foodstuff

Dry some calf’s foot root, otherwise
arum, & sprinkle the foodstuff<-s->
with it. There is no danger in this.

For transmuting grain from one vessel to
another




Take two small wooden bushels of the same
size, which should be hollow on the bottom exterior by about the
width of the back of a knife or more. One of these
will remain empty, & on the bottom of the other you will glue
kernels of grain with starch such that it will be
covered entirely with grain, & it will seem to be
filled with it. Take also a wooden bell into which you
will place as much grain as can be held within the
capacity of one of the bushels, and over the top put a simple
piece of leather that fits tightly inside the
bell. Put all into a bag or a napkin or a
folded handkerchief, if you do not want to use a
conjuror’s pouch. First show the empty
bushel, then in front of the audience fill it with
grain, then put it back in the napkin. Next,
leave that one there & take the other where the
grain is glued with starch
& it will seem to be the first one, filled with
grain. Put it under a hat & place the
bell gently on the table for the first time. And if
you like, promptly & without stopping, show the bottom which will be
covered with white leather of the color of the
wood. Then pretending to show the bushel that is
under the hat, you will turn it deftly to the side that is
empty & leave it covered. Then you will command that by
invisibilium the grain pass into the
bell, which you will have tapped shortly before on the
table a little strongly, & the grain will
fall to the bottom & cover the piece of leather.
Then lift the hat; the bushel
<-semb-> will be found empty and the bell full
of grain, which you will scrape deftly along with the
piece of leather
