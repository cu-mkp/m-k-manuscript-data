Or to be safer, retire from there until the fire has died down &
all is cooled, <-Ap-> for its exhalation would be
dangerous. And for the occasion when you
feed it with pincers,
<-b-> wash your mouth with good vinegar
& take some preservative & plug yourself up well. Once it is
dead, put it in a linen cloth or a canvas of silk &
fold it & hang it from the ceiling, where the air
<-or-> & sun dry it. Once it is quite dry,
pulverize it in a mortar. And keep this powder carefully,
because one ℥ of this thrown on iii lb of molten
♁ reduces it to finer ☉ than the other one. But it does not
have as much  weight. For this work you also
need to choose the oldest ♁ that you can, which has often been
melted & finely hammered into sheets or other works, & purify it
before by melting & throwing it into honey &
vinegar. The term of the work is nine months from
the feast of St. John  until the 25th of April.






Linseed

Whoever wants to have it beautiful & <-p-> very
delicate needs to pick it before the <-f[illegible]d->
seed is perfectly ripe. For if one waits for the seed to be
perfectly ripe, the foot is so dried by the sun that it is brittle &
breakable. It is true that in this way the seed is reduced by a
third.







Colors

If you want to keep them beautiful in gum and such that they
do not lose any of their true color, put white wine, the
whitest and clearest you can, in a bottle with a little
tragacanth gum. And having stoppered the
bottle, scramble & shake it very strongly together, &
let it rest until the tragacanth is dissolved. Also put in a
little fine-grained white salt to brighten the whole.
Some mix clear water with white wine, and with this
mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
beautifully in illumination work.
