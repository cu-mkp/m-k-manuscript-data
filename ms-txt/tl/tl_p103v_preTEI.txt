Enema



In order that the tube does not harm, for example children, or those who
<-se-> have protruding or swollen hemorrhoidal
veins, one covers the end of the tube with a piece of
chicken gut, & one folds it back over the end, &
in this way, one gives the enema.







Cast



Tin retracts when it is thick, thus it is best to cast it thin &
to make two pieces out of one, then solder them if
need be. One uses a strong piece of taffeta to sieve the fine
sand with which one first covers the medal to the thickness of a
teston.







For making colors run



Mix vinegar <-with-> a little with bile & put
it <-p-> into a glass bottle, & if
you want to keep it for a long time, add some salt to it; & of
this, mix some of it among your colors, & that will make them
run.







Earwax



If you take enough with the tip of an ear picker &
you pass it through the foam of urine, which is readily made by
those who have a headache, all the foam will dissipate.







Enamels



For recognizing well their difference and their true color by
candlelight, you need to put your candle behind a
crystal mirror or a glass globe or jar
full of water, because this light is like
sunlight.
