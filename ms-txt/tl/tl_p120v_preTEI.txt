meat & the egg some live mealworms, for it is

Crocum ferri

It is excellent plastered on wounds to stop the
blood. The best is made of needle filings.

Crocum ferri hardens molds, being reheated,
& feather alum, the more there is, it renders them softer
& sweeter.


Anatomy

 One needs to skin the animal & boil it, or else skin it &
put it into good quicklime.


Making silver run

If it is for a large work, arsenic & pulverized
tartar & thrown on the melted silver, makes it run
 and it suffices. But for fine work, one needs
aes ustum, small filings  of thin copper, e antimony, sublimate, finely pulverized.
All of this makes a mass that does not sour
at all. If the plaster is good, one ought
not to add crocum for silver, but one puts more
feather alum. It needs also some melted common

allow any wind, which should be well sealed with wax &

of common vinegar makes them rot. If the sand makes

River sand washed by the current of the
waters is good, being passed through a linen cloth
to shake the powder.

This is a rare secret, & which gives pleasure for adorning

 pick them when they are in full vigor &
growing. For if you were to take them when their season
is past, or when they are starting to wilt, they would not keep.
Having thus chosen them, therefore, take sand, the leanest &
driest you can find, which should be very fine, like that which

enamel, or like that for stampings. But above all it must not
make dust, nor remain on the hand or leave a mark on it
when you have pulverized it & then poured it from your
hand. For it is

Make sure your box is well joined in order that the sand
does not trickle out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and
remove it from the serain, & the humidity of the
night, & cover it & keep it in a dry
place.

Take heed not to put the said flowers in big
vessels, for when one pulls out one, one needs to pull out all. 




Take good heed not to pick your flowers  in rainy and
humid weather, but when the sun has been shining on
them.
