Rouge clair 
enamel

Fine gold is opposed to it, for <-[illegible]-> on it, it
remains yellowish. But alloyed gold is more appropriate for it,
such as that of √©cu & pistolet. <-If->
Gold <-f-> <-is not put back on the fire->, with its
own pale color, renders the enamel a dead color.
<-Ma-> And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back
on the fire to give it a reddish color, to make the enamels
beautiful. Otherwise, they are matte.

There is rouge clair which, once it is used with the
arene, loses its beauty.

Some can be found that have grains of gold inside, and it is
also the opinion of good goldsmiths that the good one is made
with gold.




    
    


Casting in gold

Molds are reheated better & more surely in a closed
fire, such as <-pot-> in a reverberatory
furnace. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some
important piece <-of gold e-> that has cost a lot to model in
wax, they put the molds in a pot & cover
them, & fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire
that holds them together & tight. Then, they reheat the
mold, earth & pot together, and when
everything is quite red, they cast the gold. Fine gold does
not run well, but alloyed gold does.


Gold & silver do not sour,
being entirely red and hot, quenched
in water.





Gold is a quarter heavier than lead.





When gold reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
emerald.





Take care that in the place where you want to cast the gold, no
lead, tin, or lime of these has fallen in the
forge.







A means to make the gate for small female lizards

Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and because it is
<-u->so delicate and thin that the <-gate would struggle->
metal would run with difficulty, especially when it is curled,
roll wax in little threads of this thickness

    


and apply some with the hot iron wire, as is said, one at
the end of the tail & the others, that are applied in the same way,
from one <-edge-> side of the tail to the other, as
you see depicted. But take heed to make sure that with the end of
the hot iron wire, the end of the wax barely touches
the animal, for the sand of the second cast will not touch this part.
But make sure that the end of the wax arranges itself only at the
edge of the empty part of the first mold. Make also conduits of
wax around the legs & around the contours of the body which
are a little long, & they will serve as feeders for the
molded thing.

When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate, comes out
well, the rest will also come out well.





The principal thing is that the ears of the snake come out
well-molded.





Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal & of the
thickness of a knife.
