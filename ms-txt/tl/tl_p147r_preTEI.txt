Take heed to make a border of melted wax, with a hot
iron, all around the edge of the top shell which is toward
the tail, in order the make the vent better. And make two little
strings of the same wax, <-r-> connecting from
the end the belly shell to the said edge of wax that is around
the shell of the spine, and make sure that <-turtle of->
the tail of the turtle stays between these two strings. This is
to make the vent better. This done,
oil your mold and what appears of the shell. Put the
circle around & cast with hot water, as before,
observing there what you have observed. Do the same to mold the third
part, which is the tail. And having set, <-You-> <-Uncover
your mold-> remove the clay contour, clean your
mold, & smooth it & flatten it on all sides with a
knife, like for other molds. Dip it lightly in
water, then try to release it. Usually one begins
<-ment-> with <-e-> <-back-> the
back shell, <-it is-> that is to say, the mold on top,
which is in two halves, and this one is easier to release. The other one
follows after, but because it is neighboring the shoulder of the
turtles, which are deeply ensconced, it is sometimes awkward.
Thus, when moving & pulling the mold gently, take heed to
pull the one which will present itself as the easiest, for one needs to
release one after the other. The most awkward of all is the one which
molds the <-e-> <-of-> throat, the
underneaths of the legs & the hollow shoulder pieces, which are of
such bad release that if you had not provided for it, by filling with
wax before molding what does not release well, it will be awkward
for you to pull your pieces out without breaking something. But should
this happen to you, there is still a remedy, provided that you keep
<-pi-> the broken pieces.
    
 For you can reassemble them
with points of rather strong iron & fill the crack
or fault that could be there with melted wax & the hot
iron, as with others, in order that the core for molding
hollow is made better. Next

To avoid breaking when releasing, take
heed to uncover well up until what can hold.
