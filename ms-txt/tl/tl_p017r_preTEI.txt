On the gunner



The cannon fires at point-blank from five to six hundred paces.
But not for battering, in which it can only perform well from two
hundred paces, or three hundred <-paces-> at
the most, and it should not be any farther. Its ball commonly weighs 40
lb of the King’s caliber. There is
a cannon-perrier, which weighs xxv quintals, which are
small, short cannons. It is for fighting the ditch casemates
& for battering at close range. It bears a large ball of the
King’s caliber like the others, namely of
40 lb. It bears in the breech only the width of two balls
& a quarter of a ball. The front only bears the width of
one ball & a third of a ball. Its charge is similar to those of
bigger ones, namely xx lb. And for this reason, when one wants to try them
<-[illegible]->, one ought not to over-charge it, for this damages the
piece. And for the first time & until it has fired five or six
<-pieces-> shots, it is better not to give its complete charge,
for the piece is still proving itself. And the test that one can do is
to give it a charge of xx lb of fine arquebus powder
instead of ordinary cannon powder. And four good horses
are sufficient to drag them. They are easy, & close up they have as
much force as the big ones, especially for private houses
& small towns & fortresses of little
importance. They are no more subject to bursting than the others
because they are short. For that which gives great strength to the
powder & puts the piece in danger of bursting is
the length of the piece, because the powder is burned entirely
before exiting, & <-the-> its impetuosity is held constrained
for longer in a <-small-> long piece than a
<-gr-> short one. The cannon-perrier is commonly seven to
eight pans long. It is true that this is a
pan of Montpellier & not a
King’s pan, which is not used in the
founding of cannons for making them good. For the pan of
Montpellier being <-of-> shorter, the cannons
<-more-> proportioned there are shorter also, & compensate in
thickness <-ce-> the length that they would have by the
King’s pan, by which measure they
will be found longer. But also they would be thinner. The <-e->
<-great-> <-cano-> strength of the cannon-perrier for
making a battery is 4xx paces.


<-The double canon->
    

The great cannon, because of the weight of its ball, carries
a range of only a thousand or xii hundred paces without
landing, & bouncing, it commonly bounces iii times.





The cannon-perrier does not have a large effect if not close.





One recognizes the good alloy of a piece by seeing it. For if, with the
greenness which they expel on the surface, they redden, that is to say
that they are composed of a sufficient quantity of
rosette. If not, they are only of metal, which
shows up whitish. If they themselves do not make this demonstration,
scratch & you will see. 





The good alloy for pieces is of three parts of
rosette & one of the fine metal of
<-la-> large bells, where there is more
rosette than in the metal of small bells. The
metal commonly costs xv lb & fine
rosette xv or xvi.





The pan of Montpellier is equivalent
to six of the King’s inches, which
contains in it two common ones. 







It is necessary, for <-a-> mounting a piece well, that it be as
high at the side of the mouth as at the breech. Otherwise, one does not
mount well.
