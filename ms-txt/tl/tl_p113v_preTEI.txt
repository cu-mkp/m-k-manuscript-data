such that, while reheating, the two casts will unjoin. <-And
for pl-> Therefore, for this effect, take several bowls of
different size which have a lip, to cast better. In these, pour
some common fountain water, & mix into it as
much sal ammoniac water as can be held in an
egg, # composed as mentioned.
If you want to cast in lead or tin, because one would
need more for casting gold & silver, the
water being in your bowl, <-mix->
put <-in it-> your sand in it & not the water
in the sand, & add it <-a dista dista-> with such
discretion that, <-il-> while stirring & mixing it
promptly with a wooden spoon, it does not become thicker
than <-clear-> mustard. And thus, cast <-the-> first into your mold
the lighter part, <-which es-> as is always at the surface, with a shaking motion, &
<-da-> from a little height. And doing so,
when the animal is nearly covered, blow strongly everywhere in order
to dissipate the small and big bubbles that the wetted sand makes &
continue without delay to put all the rest which is at the bottom, &
a little thicker than at the top, until everything is filled, up to the
mark for thickness that you made.

 And do not forget to shake the mold
<-in order-> while casting, in order that the wetted sand runs
& enters well everywhere. Also, tip your mold up on the side
of the head, which is higher than the body, and thus your mold
will have the same thickness, & you will spare sand.
All of this being carefully done <-fai->, let it set, which will
take a quarter of an hour. Then, release the
clay circle, which can be used another time. And leave it to dry
a little, & separate your mold from the
cake of earth, which also <-de-> will
be appropriate for molding right away, and trim the excess with a big
knife, giving || to it the long shape of a mandore.
<-Rasche->


If you can, fill your half mold in one go, & with
<-the pre-> a tempered batch, it is the best.

or two eggs, because there is no risk if there will be more.
<-And the water-> If you cast in two goes, it is enough
to put sal ammoniac water at the first bowlful. 


Make it clear like a pureed broth, or like starch
water that women use to make their starch. For
there is no risk in it being very clear, because sand always settles at
the bottom & water separates & remains on top. The sand that one 
scrapes as well [illegible]mme too weak & soft. And it will not let
itself set quickly, for all things calcined dry out promptly from mixed
water.




If you do not fill in one go your mold
<-tempered-> with tempered sand, take heed to stir your
second cast with the <-e-> <-p-> surface of the first,
<-p-> by mixing with your spoon or spatula with which you temper it.

    
    

        
<-Second cast->
        

 
 
    
Scrape & cut also away the back of
the mold, which is always the weakest, and adapt it
cleanly thus. And do not forget to make notches around, in order that the
second cast anchors itself there & binds better
            

 without changing.
        

Sal ammoniac water is not necessary to small
molds, which require neither a big nor long fire to be
reheated; however, when you put some in, it will only be better.
