 One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they
<-ont-> wilt & dry out. Dip them, therefore,
immediately in good eau-de-vie & then put them in your
tempered sand mold, like snakes. For which one needs no
release, for while the molds are being 
reheated <-s-> [<-s->], the plant burns, which does not happen with
animals that have bones <-& q->. It is necessary
that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes
because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.
            

        

    









burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts which are left inside. Next, one
needs to clean them & remove the ashes. Second, reheat them
& render them red for casting. At the beginning, reheat with some
charcoals, gently lit, and put your noyau molds flat
on the charcoals surrounded by bricks. Frame molds are
reheated on a grate.








Molding <-with-> en noyau, with the same
sand, wax images, or lead medals and suchlike

Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with wax
what does not, and then anoint your images of wax or of
lead with olive oil, very thinly & very
lightly, such that the oil makes no thickness nor body on the
medal. Then, heat a little eau-de-vie,
<-until-> & when it is lukewarm, moisten the oiled
medal with it, for if <-it is-> the water were cold, it
would reject the oil, it would not sit well on it. Next, cast your sand
of plaster, <-bri-> brick, &
wet alum on top, having arranged your image on the clay
mandore & having made a circle around it
<-de-> to give it the necessary thickness. These medals
are oiled and rubbed thus with eau-de-vie
because they are firm & hard & would not be malleable for taking
out of the<-e-> <-the-> mold, which is
tenacious, as are natural animals, which are soft &
flexible.



When you have tempered your sand, do not cast it in the middle of the
mold but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently and
that the beginning is thin & afterward thick. If your tempered sand
sounds like water falling in the mold, it is a sign that
is too thin. Make it, therefore, of medium thickness.








Casting for gold and silver



It is necessary that the molds be fiery red & ablaze when
you cast in gold & silver, or you burn flowers and
bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the
molded thing because the substance flows better when at ease and
without shaking the mold, & does not become as porous.






A way to <-grind-> enamel <-gold->
very delicate gold rose <-e-> leaves and others



After you have cast or beaten in gold the thin leaves of a
rose or other things, if you want to enamel them, you
need to solder or braze your delicate gold leaves onto
silver strips, which <-uy-> will strengthen them
to support the enamel. Next, once the thing has been
enameled, put the work in aquafortis <-d->, which will eat away the
silver & leave all the gold with its enamel.
For this, the gold needs to be passed with ciment real.
