light, pull out the hairs which make the tip too long with the
ends of your fingernails, and this until the tip seems good to
you, & until you notice in it the rat hairs
which are entirely black & the hair of the
petit-gris is <-at the->
whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind
<-b-> and tighten it very well with a thread in
two places, then cut the excess & fit it in a quill of a
convenient thickness for it, of a duck or a crow for the
small ones. Good paintbrushes are those that, once dipped
in water, do not bulge when you trace on your hand.







Oil

All oil which is imbibed by paper & once heated by
fire evaporates & leaves the paper clean, like
turpentine & spike lavender oil, is good for
making varnish.







Sand

Every ground & tempered thing becomes porous, according to
some.







Bellows furnace

Before putting in the metal, it is necessary that it be red
at the bottom, like a charcoal & well inflamed. Next,
you <-[illegible]-> fill it & cover the charcoal &
adjust the bellows, otherwise the metal on top would
melt by means of the bellows & its bottom would be
curdled & cooled & would not run. But if you proceed in this
manner you will melt everything you like.







Varnish on paper

The Germans make boxes <-p-> covered with painted
paper & varnish it with glair of egg mixed with
gum & a little oil, not of spike
lavender, but another fragrant one that resembles
olive oil. Every work done with glair
supports oil. It is with this that painters trick the
poor peasants, painting their bands of taffeta with
this glair, to be done sooner. But the first rain
carries away everything.
