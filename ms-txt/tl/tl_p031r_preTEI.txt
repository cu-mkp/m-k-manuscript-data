New vine

Having taken well, if you want it to grow strong branches, having
plowed it, put at each foot two handfuls of pigeon

Colored waters

Distilled urine, distilled vinegar and
eau-de-vie take on a cerulean and green tint from pulverized and

one for painted banners & signs that one carries in the
rain.

finger.
