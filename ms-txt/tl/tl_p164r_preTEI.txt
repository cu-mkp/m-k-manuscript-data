Gate



When you make the gate of some delicate animal, like a snake,
make it come from the side of the belly &amp; under the tail, for from
the side, there are only straight lines, which are a lot easier to
repair than the back, which is more visible &amp; more marked.







Repairing flashing



Having gently removed it with the point of a chaple or
burin, scrape it with the side of the burin, or gently
with a small file, &amp; rub with willow
charcoal &amp; little brushes. Make continuous the lines
disturbed by the flashing.







Leady silver



It degrades a lot, because the lead which is mixed in works it
like in the cupel, and makes it jump in little balls at the
edges of the crucible &amp; on the charcoal which
covers it. It is also fatty, and thus it is good to melt all coined
silver, like reals &amp; others, &amp; to put it in ingots
before melting it for casting lizards &amp; animals, for it
comes out better. I molded some as neat as the principal, such as a
little viper of silver, and I made the alloy out of 4
reals, of 20 sous from
Spain, &amp; a coin of xx
sous from France.







Blowing



When you melt silver &amp; gold, do not blow strongly
&amp; with violence, because with the charcoal
consolidating, the crucible would lower &amp;
l'arg could fall over. But when your mold is
ready, at that moment, blow strongly to heat well the silver or
gold. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with
small bellows, especially gold, for this removes their
fumes &amp; softens them.
