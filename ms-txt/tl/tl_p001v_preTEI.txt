For loosening the belly

Prunes of Saint Antonin, &, if you like,
you want put among them leaves of mallow &
gilliflower, adding in sugar &, if one wants, a
little cinnamon for the stomach.

Or else, marshmallow root in a chicken
broth. The fresh kind is more mollifying.

Beating syrup of sweet jujubes with water &
taking it in the morning loosens the belly.
