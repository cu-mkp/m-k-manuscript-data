For easing the belly

Prunes of Saint Antonin, & if you like
you want put among them leaves of mallow &
gilliflower, adding in sugar &, if one wants, a
little cinnamonfor the stomach.

Or else marshmallow root in a chicken
broth. The fresh kind is more mollifying.

Beating syrup of sweet jujubes with water &
taking it in the morningeases the belly.
