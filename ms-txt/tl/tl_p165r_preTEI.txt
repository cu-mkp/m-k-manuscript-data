Repairing

If in your cast there occurs some little hole, mend it with
gummed modeling wax that is black or gray.







Lake

If, once it is ground, you let it dry without keeping it in
water, it will dry out & you will have as much trouble
grinding it as before. <-La->







Stretching a canvas picture

If it is crumpled & creased from being rolled up, moisten it
from behind with a wet sponge, & you will stretch it very
evenly without spoiling it.







Plaster for molding

When it is long to set & dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty
& humid, which is what makes it contract in fire & crack,
causing flashing. That which is drawn from lean soil is the best.
Molds of fatty plaster ought not to be kept for a long
time, for they act like fatty earth, which when drying by itself,
cracks. It is best to reheat them
soon after they are made, &
to cast. Good plaster keeps
a long time in
molds.





It needs to be well oiled, for it is more difficult to separate
the two halves of the molds than when it is mixed.







Dragonâ€™s blood

It can be imitated with lake, which surpasses the dragon's blood in beauty if, tempered in oil, you glaze on gold or
silver. Tempered in varnish, it dies.







Repairing snakes and lizards

You could well make some puncheons according to the form of
their scales, & making some bigger & some smaller, according to
the shape of the neck, the body, & the tail. If there is something
broken, you can graft it on with small <-pieces-> points of
iron or steel wire, & glue with fish
glue, & then cover it all with gray or black wax. But it
is necessary to let the glue dry for one day
without touching it.
