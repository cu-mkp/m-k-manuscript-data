Arranging various animals

When you uncover some female lizards entwined while biting each
other, <-&-> which is the most difficult thing to mold
because of the number of feet & because of the tip of their tails,
which are very fine, <-One-> take heed that if some part should
<-trou-> be uncovered that remains as if
suspended in mid air to steady it, in order that the second cast, which
you will do on top for the second half, will not vary. And to steady it
over the void, take a little wax & rub it, 
& lengthen it on a table into the form of a thick needle, 
then cut that which you will need, & with the tip of a hot iron wire, 
join it where it will be necessary. Steady also on the <-frame-> mold all that will
have detached from it (when you uncover the half of the belly) with
some wax, taken lightly with the point of a penknife,
& joined & melted with the iron wire. And when
you make your gate, you ought only to bring the wax to the place &
to the edge of the wax which, being joined to the animal &
melting, will continue the gate up to the animal without spoiling
anything, which is a secret.




One arranges snakes bound together in embraces of love,
but that is when they are small.

    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
    
    






Flower in the mouth of the snake

If you want to put in the mouth of the snake some flower
<-q-> or some branch of a plant which contains the
antidote against its bite, take a little branch, as best
arranged as you can find, & pose its stem into its mouth. Then put
two little pieces of wax around the stem of the plant. And with
the end of a <-iron-> wire that is hot, melt the
wax a little, & with the other hand, close
the jaws of the animal. And then you can cut the head to make it burn
with the flower. If the plant <-s-> is strong enough, it
will hold up by itself, and should it be weak like wormwood
leaf, which droops, the humidity of the sand will lift it up, & make
it swim & hold up without putting anything there, although you could
pass underneath it some thread, going through with a
needle.
