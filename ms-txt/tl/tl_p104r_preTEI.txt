For eating away and dissolving entirely pure gold

℞ put common salt into aquafortis in a
matrass, and let it rest two hours without
putting it on the fire. Put in the very thin gold, and draw it
out as if it had been parted from silver.





For engraving on iron

One ℥ of verdet, ii
℥ of coarse salt & a little
sublimate, or else grind massicot with
linseed oil, and <-u-> cover
<-this-> the quite clean & polished blade or 
iron with it, & let dry in the fire or in the
sun, and draw on it what you please. Then, to engrave it & make
the water, take a liard’s worth of
verdet, & put in twice as much coarse salt,
& about four grains of sal ammoniac, & six
grains of sublimate, & the water ought not to
be hot.





Good mixture to color gold

Sulfur & small gravel, as much of one as of
the other, & the third part of
<-soufr-> salt, & as much 
terra merita as sulfur.





For gilding with silver on copper and
latten

Soften the silver like the gold, & apply it as if
you wanted to gild. And do not let it heat, so the silver
does not tarnish. And after it is well applied, boil it in
walnut oil, & next heat it a little, & thrust it in
sweet boutteure.




Enameling a cornaline

Soak some wheat flower in white wine, then
besmear & cover the whole cornaline with it. And bring the
violet kind to heat again, next put it to temper in white wine
for one or two hours, then scratch it & leave
the part you want to save on it, then reload it a little more on top.
