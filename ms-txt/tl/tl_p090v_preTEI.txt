good & proper for molding. For if it is coarse, pass it through a
sieve, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, & when
the water has rested a little, empty that which is still
troubled in some separate vessel. The coarse will promptly 
fall down to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which
will have come from the troubled water, set apart, having
settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough
bond, grind it quite dry on porphyry, & you will
render it impalpable, & which will have bond like chalk.
Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it & again will grind it & mix it with salts, or linen, or burnt
felt, or ashes of paper & similarly washed things.




Terre fondue of potters

Grind it in a <-mortar-> mustard
mill with some water & render it impalpable,
dry it & next moisten it with salt water, which gives
strength to <-u-> all sands to withstand several
casts.





Orange trees

In Italy, those who are in the colder regions, like
Lombardy, make square wooden cases, a little larger at
the bottom than at the top, and  affix buckles on its
sides for transporting them with straps, as one carries gout
sufferers, because the wheels with which one could make them roll spoil
the pathways of the gardens. And every two
years, they do not forget to open the sides of the
cases for trimming & dexterously cutting, with the soil,
the ends of the orange treeâ€™s roots, because otherwise, as they
find the wood, they contract & fold back on themselves & dry at
the tips & would make the tree die. But as they are trimmed, it
preserves for them new space <-cos-> for expanding,
without finding resistance from the wood that hinders them. And know
that, for this effect, it would be better to join the sides of the
cases with screws & not with nails, in
order to not shake the soil when one opens them.
