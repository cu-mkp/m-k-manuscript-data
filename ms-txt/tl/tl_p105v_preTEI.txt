Next, when it will be well  taken, cut the top
of the tree that exceeds your tree,  three or 4
fingers above the shield for the first time, and
 then, at the closest point, in order that is
closed. But heed well that when you will make your shield no small hole
remains at the back of the sprout, for this would signify to you that
its root would be broken, & your graft would never take; but make it
so that the back is intact. This type of grafting is practiced
from mid-May, so that the trees have already budded
& made new issue, until the beginning of
August, and so that the trees are in sap. Almond
trees, which by their nature are drier, lose their sap earlier, therefore
those who want to graft onto them mericotons,
apricots & grafts of trees with pitted fruit, which are the
best there, they are grafted in the month of
January. Generally trees with pitted fruit, like
mericoton peaches, are grafted in clefts. One says
that trees  grafted en piolet or by
shield are later to bear fruit than those by cleft.


Nightingale


It is necessary that the iron wire of its cage be of the
thickest, in order that, thinking of leaving, it will not be
hurt. Cover, from the moment that it is taken, its cage with
canvas. One needs to feed it the first
day,  taking it out from its
cage into the hand & opening its beak, & with a
small wooden pin, put it in its throat & make it
swallow. And continue thus until it is no longer opinionated. This is
done for sustaining it, for if it would become thin it would die.


Gardening

It would not be very careful to cultivate oraches in one’s
garden, because, when soup &
broth is kept a little bit cold, it engenders worms in it.


Nightingale



It needs to have a cage made in the barn,
like those for calendras, doubled with green cloth,
because it fears the cold. And for making it accustomed to
eating when first it is put in the cage, one needs to give it
ants with soil at the bottom of the cage to
make it accustomed to pecking , and give it
chopped sheep’s heart, & immediately some
eggs, & mealworms.


Fountain maker

As you will see below in the discussion of the
molder, reheated plaster promptly mixed into
water & put on the joints of the conduits of fountains,
 resists as much as any stucco.


Catching nightingalesSee the 15th folio after
this.

For trapping them, one needs to observe their nature, the food that
they like the best, & the season of their pleasure. The
nightingale, as long as it sings, maintains a territory for
itself alone. Therefore approach, making as if searching the ground for
something. And taking some worms which come from old meal or
from beneath kneading troughs or mills, which the
nightingale is fond of, put some on your hat attached
with a pin or otherwise, in order that it wiggles. And at five
or six paces from the hedge where it sings, make a hole in the
ground & put in some worms and your device of little
crossed sticks. It will be anxious for you to leave so it can go
see what you have done, and seeing worms, it will enter.

Some sell nightingales on
trees.

The coolness of the evening
and the morning, near fountains & shaded places, are
more appropriate for taking them.
