deniers, the charge vi
deniers of powder, its range iiiixx
pans & 3 feet <-lxi-> & a half, two
inches & a few lines, which is the

Pewterer

They mix viii lb or ten of lead, per
quintal of tin in cities where they are sworn
masters. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One
also uses ii lb of looking-glass tin to bind it &
three lb of debris, that is to say the copper shards
that coppersmiths make. This makes the plate more
sonorous and it is not as breakable.



This tin is called common tin.




Arquebus

To keep it from pushing back, it is necessary to clean your arquebus
every eight days, & rub it with oil, & when you
fire, wet some linen cloth in oil & put it in instead
of paper.





Lake

To test it, temper it & apply it to paper, & if one or
two hours later it does not die there, it is fine
and good.





Dyes from flowers

The red poppy, which grows amongst grains,
makes a very beautiful columbine on white leather. The
cornflower makes a very beautiful blue. A plant which
grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to flax, a long &
broad leaf like small bugloss, which has a violet flower
verging on blue & is shaped like the lily flower, makes
a very beautiful turquin, surpassing azure. Another flower, the
columbine, of the shape & size of the
bugloss flower, which has a petal resembling that of the
pansy, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows
amongst grains, in light soils.
