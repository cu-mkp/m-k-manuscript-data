[On dry preserves]


    



To dry preserves <-take a-> which are not liquid, take an
open tub pierced on both sides with a small, square window,
& pass sticks through these on one side and the other,
& place on these a sieve made of strings in the form of a
net. And on this, you will properly arrange the vessels with your
preserves. And having put at the bottom of the tub a
chafing-dish or two, cover the tub with a
bedsheet folded double.






For making a horse follow

+One needs to give it sweet bread & it
will know the one who will do him such good.

And for maintaining it in a good disposition for walking along,
<-put it-> make it take a good gait from the start of the way
& continue it.






Dogs

For keeping them from biting, it is good to have little resin
balls prepared like those of shoemakers & to throw to
them as they yap at you, & they will bite on the balls so
much that their teeth will be stuck together & they will not be able
to hurt you.






For disguising a horse

Cut its ears & tail, & with lit hay, singe
the hair on its head & elsewhere.






Boots of hay

For lack of boots, you can make rope of hay & wrap your
legs in it, & the rain will never pass
through.
