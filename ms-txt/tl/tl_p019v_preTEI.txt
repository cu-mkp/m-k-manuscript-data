Mathematical figures without ruler and compass



You know how to draw a circle correctly with the quill & or
else with the nail of your right thumb & the bent
big finger. If you do not have a ruler, fold
paper in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw
a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly without a compass,
fold your paper such that the fold <-e-> gives
you a straight line, at the required distance from which, trace
a point <-& a-> or a line & saturate it well with
ink. Then fold again the paper & rub it on the back
    & 
 it will print however much you have made. In that way <-the 
l->, A is the line without ink which the paper
fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is
printed.


    


    


    










For writing as well from the
left as from the right

P



Write as best you can with well-gummed ink on as many little
cards as you want <-[illegible]-> to write words. & once
each letter is well saturated with ink, put it down on your
paper & rub with a tooth the back of the
card.







Clysters



One used to give them with leather sleeves or bags,
which for the best result <-is-> must be of cat
skin which is more mitten-like than any other. And then one would
start to fold back the sleeve on one side & one would
continue to fold it back & twist it around itself & in that way
the clyster would run gently. But this manner takes longer & is less
convenient than the syringe which has been discovered since,
with which a man alone easily gives a clyster. It is true that
it always causes wind at the end.
