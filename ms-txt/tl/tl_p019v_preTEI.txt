Mathematical figures without ruler and compass



You know how to draw a circle correctly with the quill &amp; or
else with the nail of your right thumb &amp; the bent
big finger. If you do not have a ruler, fold
paper in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw
a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly without a compass,
fold your paper such that the fold e gives
you a straight line, at the required distance from which, trace
a point &amp; a or a line &amp; saturate it well with
ink. Then fold again the paper &amp; rub it on the back
    &amp; 
 it will print however much you have made. In that way la
l, A is the line without ink which the paper
fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is
printed.


    


    


    










P For writing as well from the
left as from the right



Write as best you can with well-gummed ink on as many little
cards as you want  to write words. &amp; once
each letter is well saturated with ink, put it down on your
paper &amp; rub with a tooth the back of the
card.







Clysters



One used to give them with leather sleeves or bags,
which for the best result is must be of cat
skin which is more mitten-like than any other. And then one would
start to fold back the sleeve on one side &amp; one would
continue to fold it back &amp; twist it around itself &amp; in that way
the clyster would run gently. But this manner takes longer &amp; is less
convenient than the syringe which has been discovered since,
with which a man alone easily gives a clyster. It is true that
it always causes wind at the end.
