Casting in gold

To cast in gold, <-it f-> crocum
ferri is necessary, & more feather alum than in the following mixture. 
The feather alum mixture cannot corrupt anything. The mold needs
to be red, & one needs to press it promptly with iron
presses.

The shell of crabs & crayfish are
awkward to burn, & there is a proper fashion of molding them.

Rats & birds can be molded, and the feet are
awkward to extract when burnt because they are small & delicate.
The bodies are extracted more easily from the mold. The feet
are cast in many <-times-> pieces.





   
Plaster


        
When you have it as a stone, choose the hardest bits and those
which do not easily crumble away with your nail, and
clean it well from powder & filth before pestling it.

    


Plaster alone does not withstand fire but breaks up into pieces.

    

    



        
Tiles


Those of the houses that are not sandy seem to withstand
fire better.





Tiles with which one covers houses, the hardest
& firmest, and purged of stones & coarse gravel,
are used to <-p-> mix in with the sand
<-And-> for molding. But, before, it is necessary to heat
them until they have been quite red for one or two
hours, & pestle them & pass them finely
through a sieve.

        

The little turtles, having just come out of the egg, are
very nice to mold.

        

 
    



        
Reheated plaster <-se ga-> as is said here, keeps
well one or two months, well pressed, in a dry
place, if it is not rainy weather. But when
fresh, it is excellent for exquisite work.     

    

        
It must withstand the fire & turn red like a lit
charcoal.
    

If the plaster is mixed with some dust or is not the
hard kind, it bursts in the fire & causes flashing.



The hardest plaster, as was said, is the best
when it is from stone, therefore take it raw of this kind. Pestle it
<-well-> as finely as possible,
and pass it through the finest sieve or sleeve that
you can. <-A-> Being thus <-p-> fine, put it
in a good amount in a cauldron or
skillet over an open flame, & as it begins to heat up, stir
it continuously, and heavy & coarse as it is, it will become so light
& so handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance
to <-handling-> stirring, as if it were water.
Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy
& dense, and that is the sign that it is cooked. But do not reheat
it until your brick and [<-feather->] feather alum are
reheated & the clay circles are made. For it needs to be the
last one reheated & when all the rest is ready, for the less
plaster #



Feather alum is the one that gives good
binding to sand.



Crocum ferri is appropriate for
gold. It is that one which, being mixed among the sand, receives it
& holds it within its warmth.


    



# remains reheated, & <-more->
the more quickly it is
put to use, the better
it is, for it sets
more quickly. One ought not
to reheat it until
you want to
mold. And to 
reheat it, put it,
as finely ground raw powder,
in a

cauldron on <-ash->
a clear flame, & do not make it either too strong nor
too violent. Always stir with a long stick to avoid the vapor,
turning it around the cauldron & in the middle, in a figure
8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy <-difficult-> to
stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to
throw off some bubbles at the edge of the cauldron. And finally,
it will become like liquid &, as it were, mealy & like bran & boiling in
the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it
has once again become heavy
