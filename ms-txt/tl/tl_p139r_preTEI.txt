Casting of lead and tin


When it is often melted, it becomes brittle &
<-fl-> frangible because it is cast very hot &
renders it half calcined. Therefore, use new.

The alloy that I have put in use for lizards &
snakes is two ℥ of fine tin for one lb
of new & unadulterated lead. The mold is made of the
aforesaid sand, common to all metals; when it is reheated let it
cool until you can hold your finger without harm
in the hole of the gate. As for lead, one melts it in a
crucible <-ju-> in the fire, with
bellows, until the crucible & the lead are
red. When it is in this state, purge it of charcoal, either
with a scraper made for this purpose or with the wind of the
little bellows. <-l-> This done, let it rest
thus red, & reheat a little on its own, then throw in, if you want,
a little rosin to burn the filth. However some find it
better not to put any in, because it leaves filth. But, when they
are ready to cast, they ought not to forget to throw inside, as well,
as much as a bean of looking-glass tin for each
lb of lead, and that it <-e-> should be
red like melted metal when it enters in the mold. And if
the mold is big, it is better to put it in a press, in
order that it joins well & that the lead does not spread outside the mold. However, should this happen & that
for the first or second or third time your mold has not filled,
cast boldly, for, provided that your metal is red, it will set
again, & join with the other, and come out very neat, like the
principal. The same can be said for fine tin for thin things.
And the alloy of fine tin is one ℥ of new lead
for one lb of this. Large molds should be placed in
very tight presses, between two sheets of
copper <-pu->, & then bury them in the sand,
which is better than ash, because <-i-><-l-> <-is-> by its weight it seals
better. Otherwise, these large molds are subject to
opening slightly by the weight of the metal. Some make square
pots



When the medal is thick, one is not compelled to cast as hot as when it
is thin.

Note that if you want to cast them in cuttlefish
bone, they ought not to be very hot because they will burn the
cuttlefish bone. Test for this effect with
paper. If it turns the paper red, it is
enough, it is good to cast, but if it blackens the
paper, it is too hot.



If you want to cast a written paper, make your alloy with
<-plom-> half lead & half
tin, & as soon as it is melted, cast between two
cartons in a very flat &
level place, & with a point of gold or hard
wood, engrave on the left the writing that you want. And having
poured lead on a carton, press on top
with the other adapted carton.
