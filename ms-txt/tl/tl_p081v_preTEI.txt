Sand

Only brick, very finely sifted, & worn down one against
another, is good for all castings of lead and copper,
mixed with urine. This needs to be of that whitish
brick.




Making copper and latten run

Put in at the end, when it is very hot & when you want to cast,
sal ammoniac & saltpeter, which removes filth
& heats it. Mix some ardides with the latten.
 Guard against the metal touching the iron or the
latten of the frame, but cover it with sand or
lute. Do the casting very evenly.




Sand

Calcined black pebbles from the river are good for
lead, but they dullen metal.

There is only <-[illegible]-> clay earth with which one makes tiles, reheated & reddened & passed through a
sleeve finely mixed with glair.

Willow charcoal is excellent for sand for
<-b-> lead.

Latten runs better.




Frame casting

It is good to make it with boxwood. Turn it in order
to make it even, as this is important for the casting. Lute also,
or cover the mouth of the frame with sand in order that the melted
metal, or lead, or copper does not touch the
frameâ€™s iron or latten, because it makes it
brittle, & makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always
higher than the mold. Also guard against the cast being too
wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
the weight of the substance that runs breaks & shakes loose the
mold & makes it porous. When you have cast, gently tap the
frame, in order that the substance spreads better. Black lead of
saulmon from the first melting makes a very neat one.
