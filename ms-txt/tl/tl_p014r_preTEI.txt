For walls of earth and rustic construction

Swallows have taught us this craft, making their nests out
of mud mixed with wisps & stalks of hay or
straw to make it bond. Therefore, in places where stone &
brick are lacking, one can use earth to make partitions
& walls. And for this, light earth, which does not
form clumps when plowed, but which is as if intermixed with
arene, holds first rank, because it can be beaten &
tamped down better. It is true that one needs to moisten it &
<-la-> cut it into the shape of sods with a ditch-spade, and
thus place & arrange it. This one lasts longer and there is not as much
construction work, and <-not-> dryness does not make it
crack & split. But, because such kinds of earth are not found
everywhere, those who are on good & fertile land, after
marking out with a measuring line the width & length of
their foundations, drive <-into the ground-> in along the edges, 
on this side & that, long <-ch-> poles
<-&-> or chevron beams to support boards
between which they throw the earth, making each
layer one foot thick or thereabouts, intermixing it
as if S.S.S with branches of heather or
similar things, then with beaters of three
different forms they tamp it & beat it. One is called the
mallet, which has a triangular form like A, and with this, one
first tamps the earth. Next one uses one which is made of blocks of
wood pointed at the tip & helved to a large stick, & this one
is for pressing the earth well at the extremities and edges of
the wall, which adhere to the boards, & is
called.

    


The other one is called the
bat, which is for flattening & beating the earth for
the last time, as shown in .C. Then one makes another layer of
earth & heather and beats it as
was said, & continues thus until the wall is complete,
which one covers with heather & then with
earth. Some <-m-> intermix rows of bricks
in the said wall. They also make the
wall tapering, giving <-a-> width to the
foundations according to how high one wants to raise the
wall. Which, when old, whitens, & thereby shows that it
has saltpeter in it. That is why, when they fall down,
gunpowder makers profit from them.
