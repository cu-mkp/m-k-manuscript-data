Molds can only be used once because for
delicate things, like wormwood & others, one needs to break
them, but before one [<-them->] needs to dip them well into water in which
the twice reheated things dissolve easily. Otherwise, you would not be
able <-f-> to release your work without danger of
spoiling it.
    


Good feather alum is white and has a luster as
of white <-c-> silk. It is in pieces
long as a finger, & is very breakable & wooly
as down. The one made of stone is harder & not so
good. <-It-> The best of the aforesaid quality is
fetched in France, near Rouan. The feather alum for our sand is pestled in a mortar and is
further ground on marble, especially since one
cannot think of passing it finely through the sieve, for it is
so fat & wooly that it would not pass through it. It is this, with
its small soft <-which-> & thin filaments, which gives
binding to the sand in a much more excellent fashion than
cloth shearings in the founderâ€™s earth of the founders
of great works, because these cloth shearings &
cloth waste burn and feather alum <-not-> resists the
fire.

To enclose the molds, when you <-em-> throw
onto the things to mold your liquid sand, make <-your-> a circle
& surround with well beaten fatty earth.

Archanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria,

<-ut->v{idelicet} res exprimenda formis, sive herba sit sive
animal
    
ut lucerta, <-in-> <-af-> <-inting->
inmergatur primum in vini spiritum

aprime rectificatum, deinde pulvere composito aspergatur

sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut

assolet).

When you want to mold hollow, it is necessary that the
core be of the same material. And if the snake or
the animal is curved or folded, one ought to make the core of
several pieces.

Test whether distilled vinegar is
appropriate for eating away & dissolving what will be in the animal
molded hollow.



If you know that your plaster is not strong enough to withstand
the fire without cracking, do not be so scrupulous an observer of the
mixture put here that sometimes you <-mecties-> would
not diminish the quantity of feather alum
<-l-> a little bit, for it softens the
molds with its softness. Once reheated, do not pulverize it on
this occasion as fine as said, but leave it as the
apothecaries have ground it, for it does not hinder the
neatness of the cast & gives more binding. When the <-sand->
mold, <-being-> having set, retains the color of brick and is reddish, it is firmer.
