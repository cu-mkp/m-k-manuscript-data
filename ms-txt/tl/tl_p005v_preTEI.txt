string & will represent a nipple as large as a plate, and
women can see the secret places that they do not
want to show to surgeons. It casts the representation out of
itself, and if you touch <-the place-> the eye of
the representation with your finger, another finger
will come against yours.

You will make a light at night for someone quite far
away, if you place the concave mirror behind a candle
placed on the window. You will be able to read and write quite
far from the candle if you place it behind the candle
& place & turn the concavity toward you. If you put
the mirror at the end of a table & a
candle on it, it will represent two lights on the
table for you. To see what is happening on a street,
shutter the window, whereby the more of it you can shut the
better it will be. Make a hole at the lower one, as wide as your little
finger, perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
place a sheet of paper on the window
& let the middle of the sheet be over the hole.
Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole & the same
size. After, place the concave face of the mirror toward the
hole, & it will represent to you all those who pass by in the
street on the sheet of paper. Similarly with
the pierced door of a closed room. You can make wavy ones
& triangular ones, in the fashion that Ptolemy describes, &
Archimedes. The concave one also sets fire to straw from
quite far away, and lights a candle with the sun. Also, 
it heats through the reverberation of fire.

Take looking-glass tin and melt it. On half a lb of
this, put half an ounce of quicksilver, and remove it
all at once from the fire & grind it, and it will be like
ash. <-Grind-> Wash it quite well in clean water.
Next, grind it on marble & temper it with water of
<-ret-> hide glue. Next, apply to
your wooden candlesticks & any other work you like,
& burnish with the tooth. You can grind pin filings
& apply them with the said glue.
