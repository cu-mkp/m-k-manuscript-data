Sand from pulverized rock salt and sand from the
mine finely ground on marble 

The one and the other, once very finely ground on
marble, after having thoroughly pestled them dry & beaten
in the mortar, I mixed as much of one as the other, and having
reworked them together on porphyry & passed them
through a double sieve or through the sleeve of a
shirt to mix<- s-> them even better, I put them in paper
& put them on a marble in a cellar. In
one night, they had been wet enough by
themselves without moistening them further, because rock salt, like
all other salts, dissolves in the humidity. I molded very
neatly with it, because both were very finely ground. They want to be
<-f-> humid enough to release well.


    
    

    
    


Mineral sand

It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it
must be in one piece & as if taken from a quarry or
rock formation, & the deeper one takes it from, the
better. The signs of its goodness are that it is thus amassed, and that
when removing itself in the form of rock, it comes out in lumps &
<-qu-> bricks, which demonstrate its bond & that it
is not too lean.

However, it should break apart between your
hands & have very small
<-men-> & delicate grains & of the same nature.
If it is not delicate enough, you can pass & grind it finely, either
through water or through a sieve <-& when
it-> or on the porphyry, & in this way, from
<-sil-> lean they become fatty & well bound. You
can mold with it in <-sa-> frame or
en noyau without cloth waste, & try it with
lead, for if with this it does not become porous & casts
neatly, it will also behave well with copper. Some say that the
fatty sands do not want the metal to be cast too hot.
Artisans who work in large works &, who for profit, do not
need to grind & seek the curiosities of artificial sands,
benefit more from seeking some that is ready-made by nature, which has the
finest grain possible, & for small works, they only pass it
through a sieve. But those who work in small works, finely
grind it & grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of
it.



Orber√© grain makes a tawny powder, very
delicate & very soft, which, once mixed, could <-mix-> mold
very neatly. Try wheat flour burned over a closed
fire.
