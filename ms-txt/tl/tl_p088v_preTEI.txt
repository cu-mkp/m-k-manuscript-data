  Sand from pulverized rock salt and sand from the mine finely ground on marble  The one and the other, once very finely ground on marble, after having thoroughly pestled them dry &amp; beaten in the mortar, I mixed as much of one as the other, and having reworked them together on porphyry &amp; passed them through a double sieve or through the sleeve of a shirt to mixs them even better, I put them in paper &amp; put them on a marble in a cellar. In one night, they had been moistened enough by themselves without dampening them further, because rock salt, like all other salts, dissolves in the damp. I molded very neatly with it, because both were very finely ground. They want to be f humid enough to release well.   Mineral sand It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it must be in one piece &amp; as if taken from a quarry or rock formation, &amp; the deeper one takes it from, the better. The signs of its goodness are that it is thus amassed, and that when removing itself in the form of rock, it comes out in lumps &amp; qu bricks, which demonstrate its bond &amp; that it is not too lean. However, it should break apart between your hands &amp; have very small men &amp; delicate grains &amp; of the same nature. If it is not delicate enough, you can pass &amp; grind it finely, either through water or through a sieve &amp; when it or on the porphyry, &amp; in this way, from sil lean they become fatty &amp; well bound. You can mold with it in sa frame or en noyau without cloth waste, &amp; try it with lead, for if with this it does not become porous &amp; casts neatly, it will also behave well with copper. Some say that the fatty sands do not want the metal to be cast too hot. Artisans who work in large works &amp;, who for profit, do not need to grind &amp; seek the curiosities of artificial sands, benefit more from seeking some that is ready-made by nature, which has the finest grain possible, &amp; for small works, they only pass it through a sieve. But those who work in small works, finely grind it &amp; grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of it.  Orberé grain makes a tawny powder, very delicate &amp; very soft, which, once mixed, could mix mold very neatly. Try wheat flour burned over a closed fire.
