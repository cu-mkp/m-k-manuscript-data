For making â˜€ run



Verdigris & sal ammoniac, as much of one as the
other, borax & saltpeter, as much of one as
the other. But the <-s-> borax &
<-sel armo-> saltpeter together must only weigh
half of the others, that is to say, as much together as the
verdigris. Grind them finely into powder on
marble, then grind them again with some good strong
vinegar until it is fine, like a couleur and
verdet ground in oil. Next, leave it to dry on its own, if
you have time, or in the <-slow-> fire of the
forge, & make sure it is well dry.

One of the principal things for the cast is to cast very
<-gec-> hot, <-s-> especially the great
metals.









For casting of gold in large works



One needs not only to clamp the molds well but to
fortify them with good bindings of iron wire or little
bands made for this.





Before casting in gold, clean your forge well of
lead & tin.







Secret for soldering gold and silver in
small works



If some piece of small foot does not come out well in gold or
silver, by fault of not having made a gate of
wax underneath, beat some soldering gold very thinly, then cut it in
as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this phlegm
 or white thick <-which-> saliva that is found on
the teeth, & with the point of a burin,
apply it to the place you want to solder, & place there a
little spangle of gold; & next, with a little fat
earth wetted with saliva, make a small layer on the
opposite side to hold the solder better. Next, pulverize on top a
little borax & put in the fire. Boiled water of
quince seed & others also.
