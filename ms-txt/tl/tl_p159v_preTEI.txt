Cleaning files

Sometimes they are fattened, & by means of the grease, the
lead, which is fatty in itself, or other filings, attach
to it. And you will be able to clean them either with hot
charcoal or a scratch brush made of wires of
latten.




Carnation

It is molded like the rose, marigold & all
other flowers thus, as is said, namely, whole-mold flowers, & all
the leaves, if you want, in two halves, joining them by solder
for the most secure way, even if you could mold them together in a closed
mold. I cast one that came out very well. But one needs very thin sand & to blow strongly.


    




Molds

Make the two sides so that they are, <-es-> if it is
possible, one as thick<-ness-> as the other, in order that they
can be quite evenly reheated. When you mold some animal that should be
burned <-you->, like crayfish, you cannot open it to
clean it, & make the cast so that it is not reheated. And when they
are reheated one time, keep them scarcely at all without casting, for
they are rendered musty & humid, & the mold is undone
& loses its strength.




The part where the back of the animal is is usually thicker.





Plaster alone

Reheated stone plaster <-fears-> is undone in
water, but that which is <-reheated &-> first
pulverized and then reheated does not fear it. But if it is good, it
hardens in it, like the one of Paris &
Spain, which is hard in stone, as is that which
grows in lean & dry earth and which seems like 
white salt. Germans make statues for their fountains
with it, which are not spoiled, especially once varnished, but it hardens in water. When it is alone & not mixed, it sets more quickly than otherwise. One needs to oil very lightly
your molds that are of metal or stone, otherwise it would
not release. And however you oil, you have to temper it with hot
water. And when it has set & well cooled, one
needs to wet it sometimes in cold water, but if it refuses to
open, in hot water & sometimes in boiling water.





Sometimes one even needs to make the mold boil in hot
water, as when you have molded some wax that you fear would
not be easily released from it.




Cold water makes oil withdraw to the surface of the
plaster that has sucked it in, & thus it releases.
