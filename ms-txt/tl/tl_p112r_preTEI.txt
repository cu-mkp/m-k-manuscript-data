For tempering sand

You need to have a big basin full of water to
<-q-> soak the molds to open them, a
flagon full of common water, a
lead bowl for tempering your sand, a small
wooden spoon to collect the wetted sand in the
bowl. <-The big basin is for tr->



To make handles for your large oil paintbrushes, if you do
not have large enough feather quills, take two of them,
& slit them, & join them together.








Decoction of sands

Already mentioned.





For molding en noyau. Mixture of sand

Having reheated your sand, namely the plaster, the
feather alum & the brick, & having
passed them finely through the sieve,
#, mix them this way: take four parts of
plaster, two of brick, & one of feather alum. Mix them all together with your hands
<-that it-> in such a way that one cannot discern one from
the other. With your sand ready, you need to put to death the animal that you
want to mold <-de->, in this manner.



#
except for the feather alum, which
should be ground in a mortar





Putting to death the animal for molding

You need to be careful not to wound it in taking it. And, having put
it in a glass bottle <-d-> with
bran, or in a barrel <-full-> half full of
fresh & humid earth, if you want to store them or keep them a
long time, give them live frogs & not dead ones
to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &
grow thin & have long wrinkled <-aulx-> skins. Thus the best would be to
mold it as soon as <-after-> possible
<-apre-> after it has been taken. But before, put it to
death in this way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so
that it would collect no dust. And put inside such a quantity of good
vinegar & urine that it can be covered. And shake it
& torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in an hour or a half. But if you are in a
hurry



To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
& when piercing it, it would draw back & spoil the mold.



Water snakes hardly bite.
