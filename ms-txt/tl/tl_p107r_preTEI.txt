as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste, & that it is
not so easy to handle as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is
cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws off big bubbles or
exhalations, in the middle & around, as long as a
finger. Seeing it in this state, remove it from the
fire, for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it
would be too much & would not set as well. For when it becomes red
& overheats, it loses its strength & spoils the sand. Leave it
to cool before mixing it with the other sands. And when it is cold,
mix and mold, for the sooner after its cooking you use it, the
sooner it will set.





Catching lizards and snakes

Take a stick and attach a string at the end which
has a <-knot-> <-eyelet-> slip
eyelet at the end. And there being two or three to distract the
lizard by whistling, approach the eyelet toward its neck,
and when its head [<-l->] is inside, pull. The lizard is more
tedious to catch by hand than the snake &
bites without letting go & grips like pincers.

Snakes can be caught by hand, provided
that it is covered by a thick woollen cloth, for the
teeth of the snake stay in the cloth & cannot
pierce like they would with a linen. The dangerous ones are
recognized by their blue & <-asses-> aseures
azure eyes. They hardly ever bite in
water, which crayfish catchers
experience.

The sand mixture is of two parts of plaster, pulverized
& reheated as said, & of one part of tile,
reddened <-and p-> <-pre-> in a good
fire after the first cooking & then finely pulverized, and of
feather alum, half as much as of the brick, namely two
full crucibles of plaster, one of brick
& a half of feather alum. There can never be too
much feather alum, for <-s-> this is
what gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand
withstand the fire without cracking & bursting. Otherwise, without
it, the sand would not withstand it. This sand, thus composed, is proper
for all metals, but if you want to use it for gold, one
needs more feather alum <-&-> than the aforesaid 
composition, and mix in some crocum ferri. For it is this one that attracts gold.

It is necessary that all sand with which you want to cast well,
withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands
<-abon-> <-c-> a great firing without
getting spoiled.

Feather alum is awkward to pestle, and it does not
pass through the sieve. Thus, one needs to grind it finely on
marble. And the white one <-that v->
in powder that apothecaries sell is good. It is
ground better <-su-> in the mortar by pestling
& dragging the pestle, thus you will render it very
fine.

Crocum ferri must be set ablaze in a
glassmaker’s fournaise for four
days.
