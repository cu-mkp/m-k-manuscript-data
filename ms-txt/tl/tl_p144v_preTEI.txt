having been thus arranged & well cleaned with
brushes, place <-the-> the circle of
clay around the slab. Then, with a band of
clay placed on the middle of <-e-> the
<-the-> back of the turtle, as you see, & at the
widest place, divide your mold. Subsequently, oil with
your paintbrush dedicated for this the half of the shell
you want to mold. Temper in hot water, so that without burning
yourself, you can hold your finger in it without
burning yourself, your sand, a little <-p-> thick.
And <-f-> before casting it, rub the shell with
eau-de-vie. And next, cast your sand & let it set, and note
that all things that have shells or that are hard or are not
malleable, like snakes & lizards, want to be
oiled to release. Things that are malleable do not need this.
Hot water makes the tempered sand <-in water-> set
better on oil, which otherwise would be refused.



    
 Once your half of the
turtle is thus <-desp-> molded,
separate it, with its half mold, from the clay
slab that you will set aside to return it to when it is necessary.
Next, clean your half mold & smooth it & flatten, like
the others. But because it happens that because <-u-> of
the clay entredeux, the half mold will consist
of more than half of the turtle, cut & pare down smoothly
the excess, & clean everything well with brushes. Then,
make on the top edge of the mold, on the side that is cut &
halfway, two notches, like for other molds, and return your
turtle to its slab as it was, & secure its two
legs, which are not molded, with iron wire points. And
stuff all around what is empty, up until the edge of the top shell, with
clay. Next, place the circle around and put a
clay entredeulx on the first mold, a little
above the notches. And having oiled the <-d->
first half mold, & its notches, and the shell of the
turtle, & having also showered it with eau-de-vie,
heat your water, temper you sand with a little sal
ammoniac water & the said hot water, & cast. Having set,
adapt the sides of these two molds smoothly, & on each side
secure their joint, which can only just be perceived, with two
clamps, in order that when uncovering afterward the underneath
of the turtle, they are not undone. Next, uncover the side of
the belly & of the throat, in the way that you uncover a
crayfish, which is the most difficult to mold of the little
beasts, which are molded in two halves.








You can mold the turtle with one piece for each side, but one
would need to burn it. And afterward, to make the hollow, the reheated
mold cannot be oiled because it drinks the
oil.

If there is some crocum in the sand, the joints of the
molds can hardly be perceived.
