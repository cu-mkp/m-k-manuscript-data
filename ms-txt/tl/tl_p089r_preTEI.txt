Sand of burnt ox bones and rock salt

I have pulverized them separately & finely ground them on
porphyry, as much as I could. Then I mixed as much
of one as the other & reworked them on
porphyry. Next, I moistened it in paper,
folded in a wet napkin, which is previously made in the
serain of the night or in the
moisture of the cellar. And I have not found anything else
which releases more neatly than this one. It wants to be rather humid.
And if you want to cast very thin, make sure it is very hot. It came out
very neatly in soft tin, like the principal, and withstood
several casts. For tin, I believe that it is not necessary to
seek a better one, nor for fine lead either, which comes out almost
as neatly as tin. <-Tou-> The bone of the foot
of oxen is always so lean on its own that, without being
mixed with one or two parts of some fatty sand & one that has bond,
such as tripoli, salts, felt, ashes &
similar things, it would not release & would not mold neatly, for it
crumbles.




Reheating or drying a molded frame

Always put the most delicate part, such as the face, above, so that
nothing falls in it that could hinder your fusion.




Natural sand

It does not want to be reheated for lead and tin,
<-m-> and is better very new & fresh.
