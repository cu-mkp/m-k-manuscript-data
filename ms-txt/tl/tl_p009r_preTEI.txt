Plowman

Because millet is by nature very dry,
harvesters beat it most often at night in the cool
& by moonlight. Which could not be done with another
grain that is more humid, for one <-le-> must let the
sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the sun is
approaching midday. Quickly after the millet is
cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats it & makes it lean as
much as if the millet was still standing. The ground
where the millet has been sown diminishes much
in its fertility <-& c->, which one knows
<-well-> at the next sowing that one makes after that. But above
all the grain called
    pomole in Gascony or
baillard in France, makes the earth shake seven years later,
according to the common saying. Beans
improve & correct the soil, provided that one lets the roots & stems
rot in it.







Painter

Some, after having laid down their color, soften it with the flat of a
feather. But the large paintbrush is best.







Merchant

They commonly have four books. The tyrant, which is a
formulary for apprentices, by which they can know how much
every item of merchandise costs & <-co-> for how much
it should be sold. The second is the waste book, where they put down in
rough what they sell daily. The third is the sales book, where they
reduce to clean copy and put the retail account of what is contained in
the waste book. The fourth is the account book, which mentions the sale,
the balanced account, the bill & the term of payment, & to this one
<-l-> credence is given in court.
