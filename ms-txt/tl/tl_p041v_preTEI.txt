Glassworkers’ black

Iron scale taken from bars that have been in the fire for a
long time, & which is thick, is much better
than that common delicate kind that falls under the anvil in the
forge, because it imitates niello. To the said black,
described elsewhere, some add <-d-> a little
minium to it.









Sheared ewes

If the shearer sometimes wounds them, he puts
<-[illegible]-> the very dung of the ewe on top. When they
are fat, they are easier to shear & do not get wounded so easily.




If the shearer wants to
viscorter them, that is to
say castrate, when they are one or two years old, he
must not have been with his wife for this would make the sheep
die.







Colors and gilding on glass

One ought not to give as strong gum water on glass for
<-the gold as for-> the silver layer as for the
gold because a silver leaf is twice as strong as a
gold leaf. Also, silver is harder and therefore does not
scratch as easily. <-Q-> And if the gum was not a
little strong for the silver, the latter would not split so
neatly. When you work, <-the humid-> the exhalation of your
breath moistens the leaf laid on the glass, &
therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times.
You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank
& serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not
quite clean of the gum’s greasiness & viscosity,
<-the-> & of other things, the colors would not be so neat
on it. To advance your works, you can pounce, or, better still,
layer the gum & leaf on a cut paper. In this way, you
will only need to repair very little. If you want to make gold color
there without gold, mix soaked dried saffron with a little
massicot.
