which is usually of a height of <-d-> three
pans <-& will reheat well the->. But first,
it is necessary that you have reheated your furnace
<-with-> with a little of the big charcoal, such that
the bottom is red hot and then you will put there the aforesaid load of
charcoals in the middle of which you will put your iron,
not all at once but ten or fifteen lb each time. And when this
will be swallowed <-&-> at the bottom of the furnace,
always put in as much again. And add three or four shovels of
new charcoal which should be of the biggest kind and remoistened,
in order that it may have more heat & not be consumed too soon.
And when you see that your furnace is full of substance, around
two quintals, or less if you do not [<-of it->] have that much, you will
leave the charcoal to be consumed by itself. And when the
charcoal is as it were reduced down to the level of the
furnace, you will be able to pour into molds &
iron or metal shells, which is even better
because one iron attaches to the other. And it is necessary that
the inside of the mold be well ashed with tempered
ashes, in order that it does not adhere to it.

For removing fine hair from the forehead

Take a needleâ€™s worth of fine silk &
pass it tightly across the places with the hair & it will attach
to the silk like fine cotton wisps.





Silk

Crimson is more abundant than all
other silks because its color does not charge as do blue &
green, which are also more profitable for the worker. Black is less
abundant because it charges much.





Keeping oranges

One needs to choose quite whole ones which are not rotten &
put them & fill a well closed <-and-> tin
vessel with them & they will keep six
months.





Candles

They keep well in bran which makes them white &
long-lasting, so say some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep
them in a cool & dry place, in such manner that they are
not pressed together. It is better if there is a hemp
thread throughout the wick, which gives it more light & makes the wick hold up
straighter. Otherwise, if it is all of cotton, as those of
Montauban make, it is necessary to snuff it out often, for
after it has burnt <-il-> a little, the cotton
droops & makes the candle drip.
