  Molding hollow This iron wire point, which is put thus bi through the hole, is to better hold the core &amp; keep it from shifting. All of this being d thus arranged, lay your mold on the table, the hole at the top, as it is marked here on the side, &amp; then adapt a circle of soft clay aultr, two fingers high, around the hole, like for other molds. And then temper your molding sand moderately thick, &amp; cast it through the hole until it is well well filled, up to the surface of the clay circle. But take heed to not cast r in through the middle of the hole, but rather from the side, for, since the already made mold drinks and sucks the moisture of the new, the new one that you cast in which dries quickly on the edge of the mold, being quickly dry, s would obstruct the mold, &amp; it would not finish filling. And when you cast from the side, if you recognize that it is obstructed, you can clear a path. Having cast in, blow on the f the wet gate, &amp; put the end of your finger in the hole a few times, po or some small point, to unblock it, &amp; make the hollow wax fill up. Cast in, at the end, the sand, tempered a little thick to give strength to the mold, for water coming to the surface s of the mold always makes it softer. Having set, scrape off the clay circle &amp; the excess which is on the hole through which you cast the noyau, &amp; nothing will be discernable. When your mold is thus prepared, lute it all around with the same sand which served for the molds. Next, reheat it in a slow fire at the beginning, &amp; the mouth of the gate at the bottom, in order that the wax flows out gently. For if you were to give it great heat until the wax came out, it would boil inside &amp; leave some pustules &amp; lumpy things, although  This point is placed in the middle &amp; through the hole of the gate when the mold is in several pieces, like a turtle, and this is done in order that the core does not shake. But when the mold is only of two pieces, it is not necessary to put points in the middle of it.       Before casting the core, make some notches all around the hole through which you want to cast, in order to always better secure the mold.  Mixed tallow is the reason that, when emptying the wax, the hole does not become obstructed. One needs half tallow &amp; half black wax.  All very thick pieces come out better in hollow, because a thick mass of mostly lead remains hot a long time &amp; eats the mold.  You can, after the cast is done, mold a the part of the shell of the belly where you have made the hole on the natural one, and reattach it with solder.  X Note that, after your core is cast, it is better to put the mold in hot water to open it, in order to remove the most wax that you can, always softening a it in hot water. For the less wax that remains in it, the better, in order that, when reboiling in large quantity in the mold when you reheat it, no pustules or lumps are made in it. And then, if there is hardly any wax, you will not need to reheat it as much. When opening the mold, the cast will break. But it can easily be repaired, even though you cast A        the white wax with which you have composed your black sulfured wax, has such little substance, since being dry and purified, that it leaves nothing inside, and flows very gently. As for the charcoal which is mixed in, if some remains, it burns &amp; reduces to ash &amp; is emptied afterward by blowing through the gate. You could even open your mold after the wax has melted, if there is no fanciful thing which could break, like some reattached thing or similar. After having covered the clamps with the lute from your sand &amp; having covered all of the mold, give it on top a layer of common lute, &amp; then sprinkle this with some pestled brick, in order that you can handle it better. Let the lute dry slowly before firing it, which melts the wax. The wax having left through the gate, that which remains with the charcoal will burn. Being reheated for the first time, lute it pou once more, to reheat it the second time because the plaster, not being good, will have readily made the mold retract, and the joints will crack open, which might make large flashing. And for the second time, one ought not to reheat it if you only want to cast in lead or tin, but rather only make sure that the lute is quite dry &amp; the mold moderately hot. For these turtles that have a large size &amp; enough thickness, it is better to mold ault cast your lead an alloy half of lead &amp; half of tin, especially for hollow things. For, if you only have very thin &amp; very weak things to cast, like flowers, rely rather on the abundance of lead than of tin, which becomes porous once cast a little thick, &amp; readily makes some flaw around the cast. Maistre Alexandre says that he has never gone wrong with half tin &amp; half lead for things weighty &amp; with the thickness of the back of a knife. If there is crocum, the joints hardly appear, &amp; consequently, the flashing is very small &amp; thin. You can repair &amp; through the hole of the belly, pull the earth of the core, leaving it wet a long time;  When you have cast your black wax in the a mold, &amp; when it is quite cold, you need to the open your mold halfway, to make the cast. And if the figure of black wax breaks, there is no danger, for it can always be reattached with a hot iron touching point. Or else, if the pieces are not separated from the mold, qu they meet up &amp; join like beforehand by joining &amp; binding well the two halves of the mold. When the figure is large, one needs to cross inside many iron wires to sustain the core.     A only in lead or tin. However, one needs to redden the mold nearly as much as if there were inside some animal to burn, in order that the wax melts well &amp; leaves nothing inside &amp; flows on its own by keeping the mold leaning toward the gate when reheating it. And when the mold is reheated, leave it to cool gently, then blow inside, and draw toward yourself, while sucking, in order that the ashes of the wax come out. Do this with bellows.     however, do not remove it until you have completely repaired the turtle, for you will use this earth as cement if you need to embed something or repair with the small chisel. If there is some flashing at the joints of the mold, you will remove it, either with the burin called a chaple or a very sharp penknife, or with a small file, &amp; then with the small chisel, always having the natural one, to do this better, in front of you. You can curl on a file the point of a small chisel which is not quenched to make something lumpy. For these two turtles &amp; hollow things that presuppose being large enough, cast your alloy of half lead &amp; half fine tin. There is more work in molding a turtle than for twelve molds of flowers. If there is some crocum in your sand, there will not be flashing, &amp; if, by some chance, there is some on the sides, it will be thinner than paper, as long as your mold is tightened well with a press. And to make the scales of turtles or other animals, you can make some little small chisels in the fashion of a round cutting-punch, others in the fashion of a gouge or the scale of a snake &amp; lizard, and others on a file to make the curly &amp; lumpy bits. The turtles which are not molded hollow do not have as much work, for they are molded in two pieces, to repair them with small chisels, small cutting-punches, small gouges &amp; small serrated chisels.     Wheat oil One needs to make it between two quite sparkling hot iron plates, especially the lower one, which will be sloping, on which you will put some wheat, quite even &amp; uniform. And then you will place the other, all red, on top, &amp; you will press it until you see the black oil drip well. Reiterate that until you have enough of it. This oil dries immediately. It gives gold color to silvered &amp; burnished things, augments the color of gilded things, serves as a varnish on iron for etching on it afterward, for varnishing sword guards tawny. And could also serve makers of gilded leather well. One needs to use it when it is newly made. And for things to be molded, it must not be as thick as for coloring.  It is not for anointing hairy animals, for it is too strong &amp; stiff, but it is good to give form to the legs of a small animal, like a fly &amp; suchlike. It is also excellent for coloring false white stones.
