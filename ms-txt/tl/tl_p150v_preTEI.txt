Molding hollow

This iron wire point, which is put thus
<-bi-> through the hole, is to better hold the 
core & keep it from shifting. All of this being
<-d-> thus arranged, lay your mold on the
table, the hole at the top, as it is marked here on the side,
& then adapt a circle of soft clay
<-aultr->, two fingers high, around
the hole, like for other molds. And then temper your molding sand
moderately thick, & cast it through the hole until it is well [<-well->]
filled, up to the surface of the clay circle. But take
heed to not cast <-r-> in through the middle of the
hole, but rather from the side, for, since the already made
mold drinks and sucks the moisture <-of the new->, the
new one that you cast in <-which dries quickly-> on the edge of
the mold, being quickly dry, <-s-> would
obstruct the mold, & it would not finish filling. And when
you cast from the side, if you recognize that it is obstructed, you can
clear a path. Having cast in, blow on the <-f->
[<-the->] wet gate, & put the
end of your finger in the hole a few times, <-po->
or some small point, to unblock it, & make the hollow
wax fill up. Cast in, at the end, the sand, tempered a little
thick to give strength to the mold, for water coming
to the surface <-s-> of the mold
always makes it softer. Having set, scrape off the clay
circle & the excess which is on the hole through which you
cast the noyau, & nothing will be discernable. When your
mold is thus prepared, lute it all around with the
same sand which served for the molds. Next, reheat it in a slow
fire at the beginning, & the mouth of the gate at the bottom, in
order that the wax flows out gently. For if you were
to give it great heat until the wax came out, it would boil
inside & leave some pustules & lumpy things, although





This point is placed in the middle & through the hole of
the gate when the mold is in several pieces, like a
turtle, and this is done in order that the core does
not shake. But when the mold is only of two pieces,
    



it is not necessary to put points in the middle of it.

    







Before casting the core, make some notches all around the hole
through which you want to cast, in order to always better secure the
mold.



Mixed tallow is the reason that, when emptying the wax,
the hole does not become obstructed. One needs half
tallow & half black wax.



All very thick pieces come out better in hollow, because a thick mass of
mostly lead remains hot a long time & eats the
mold.



You can, after the cast is done, mold <-a-> the part of the shell
of the belly where you have made the hole on the natural
one, and reattach it with
solder.



X Note that, after your
core is cast, it is
better to put the mold
in hot water to open it, in order
to remove the most wax that you can, always softening
<-a-> it in hot water. For the less wax
that remains in it, the better, in order that, when reboiling in large quantity in
the mold when you reheat it, no pustules or lumps are made in
it. And then, if there is hardly any wax, you will not need to
reheat it as much. When opening the mold, the cast will break.
But it can easily be repaired, even though you
cast A
