to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau-de-vie or else mix a little with the vinegar. And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of eau-de-vie, one uses
vinegar and <-er-> urine. But for small
ones, only eau-de-vie, which is done sooner.
When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it carefully of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like
lizards have, and then arrange it thus.





Now, put enough in a glass, & soak & continually keep in it
the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
big.





Take heed, before it dies, to keep the eyes open <-es->
by blocking the eyelids with a little bit of wax or something
else.







<-Molding-> Making the arrangement and disposition
of the animal

Having made provision of fatty earth called
clay, that should be grey because that commonly is the best, or
another which has good binding & which should be well prepared &
beaten, such that it is handleable without attaching to the
hands nor the work, make a lasagna or like a

cake of this earth equally flattened with a round

stick which pastry makers use, which should be a little
thicker than a thumb. And on this
cake, arrange your animal, <-aya->
imitating in that its nature & <-fa-> the fashion in
which it commonly turns itself. And first, with a good needle,
pierce it from underneath in the middle of the throat & up to
<-u[illegible]-> the top bone of the head. Retract the
needle, & in its place & its hole, put the point of
an iron wire of such a length that it suffices to hold the
head of the animal as <-q-> high as it must be, & if
the skin moves into the inside <-&-> when you put in the
point
, pull it out with <-a->
<-point-> the edge of your small pincers, &
arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point in the
cake of clay. Thus, the head will be held high,
which will have better grace, & being secured, next, arrange the gesture
of the body & the feet & the entanglement as you think will
look best. And so that it is secure & does not move at all when you
cast in the sand, <-put-> secure the legs
<-& the corp-> with little points of iron
wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp
needle. Do the same on the body parts that you will deem necessary,
<-arranging-> making sure that the points
passing through the animal are fixed in the cake of earth
and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal
by a





Take a fine needle of steel, & which is the sharpest
possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the points
of iron, it passes without forcing anything, & by its
roughness does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a thickish
point of iron in thick places & thin ones in thin
places. But heed as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
point passed through the animal in the slab of earth,
<-for-> but having planted it, take it out of the
earth & not out of the animal, & <-do ains-> 
next, fix it. This is done because, by fixing it the
first time, it pushes in the skin of the snake, and by taking
the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.




When you put again the points you have already used, clean them
well of rust so that they do not take away some skin.



The principal disposition of your arrangement is to <-di-> place
the head raised & looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head
on a solid plank or table <-& [illegible]->, making the
point pass through the bottom of the throat,
<-sâ€™arrestan-> entering into the top of the head,
