But <-because-> the fingers do not press
evenly, for <-one-> if you press on the edges, the middle will
remain hollow. Begin, therefore, by the middle, & then follow the
edges. But to make it better, put on the medal something flat &
smooth, or some large square file <-e->, & press with
this, for you will press equally, sometimes <-after l->
with your knee, other times with your
foot with your shoe taken off, & make the
bone be on top; thus you <-lâ€™emprand->
will imprint it without breaking it. If, on the first go, it is not
molded well, return to it several times. Then, repair & smooth on the
sides your <-d-> halves of molded bone.
<-&-> And to cut it well, always begin coming from the
softest part to the scales. And if your medal does not come out by
itself, scratch the bone from the back, which is rugged,
and it will release. When you want to cast, secure & join your two
bones with some small points of wood,
&c. But to mold very neatly, there is only our sand.

When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves
upright, pass a thread through the mold to keep them
from rising up, & cast the sand little by little, & always blow
strongly in order that it settles everywhere, otherwise it will become
lumpy.
        

Because you did not put in this a clay slab, the
mold sometimes holds to the table where you cast it.
To undo it, hit a great blow of a hammer at the side of the
table.






Molding plants and flowers

One does not need clay slabs, because plants or
flowers are not laid on top but as in air, without touching on any side
anything. <-&-> Only the <-es->
circle & contour are needed, which should be
higher than for flat molds. And thus, take heed to make it
strong and thick according to the size that you want, otherwise it would
burst, the sand being inside. Secure it & fortify it well by the
foot, & join well all the joints. Then, take your flower, well joined
& securely adapted to the end <-of
cir-> of the gate of wax, which should not be rough
but rather smooth, in order that it can release well. Then, wet your
flower or plant in some good eau-de-vie, <-or else
moin-> placed in a long glass


    



    






It is enough to reheat
your luted mold once
for flowers & to heat it the second time
if you cast with tin & lead,
for with gold & silver, one needs
to reheat it twice.


Cast your tin very red in the mold, of
such heat that you can hold your finger
there without harm in the hole.
