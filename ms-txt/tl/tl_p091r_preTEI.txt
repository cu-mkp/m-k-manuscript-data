Grafting

With any tree that has coarser marrow, the graft is awkward
to be cut well, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, &amp; if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the vine, from all
peaches &amp; apricots.

Apricot trees have a very thin bark, &amp; thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of prune trees &amp; almond trees.

The grafts scarcely  take if the cut of the tree is
wet. One needs then to graft in serain &amp; mild
weather, &amp; not too cold &amp; windy.

Old wood that one leaves to the graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made &amp; of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, &amp; if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood than the young better, because it is harder than
the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile &amp; short &amp; slow to
grow.





Molding with cuttlefish bone

Guard against keeping them in a humid place, for they are
very prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the bone
in two, then even it out with a knife. And on a hooked
roof tile, quite dry &amp; quite smoothed &amp; covered with
pulverized willow charcoal, rub &amp; smooth the two
halves of the bones. Thus they imbibe this willow
charcoal, which makes them release well &amp; guards against removing
anything. Then, on a counter bone, that is to say a piece of
brick evened to the size of your bone, place
your medal, &amp; then on this one, place the bone,
&amp; press well with some other piece of the same size on the top. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, pounce on top with
willow charcoal &amp; blow lightly, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole bones. All cast work is brittle &amp; subject to
breaking, because the metal expands when cast, &amp; retracts
&amp; condenses under the hammer. That is why one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a chisel, &amp; in this way the
metal retracts. Let it thus escrouir. If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the mold &amp; hollow it
with a penknife to make way for the medal, &amp; then
mold. And if the medal has two sides

Before casting, heat the
bones in order to make them lose only the coldness &amp;
moisture.

When the lead gets too hot, it
calcines.
