Grafting

With any tree that has coarser marrow, the graft is awkward
to estre cut well, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, &amp; if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the vine, from all
peaches &amp; apricots.

Apricot trees have a very thin bark, &amp; thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of prune trees &amp; almond trees.

The grafts scarcely  take if the cut of the tree is
damp. One needs then to graft in serain &amp; mild
weather, &amp; not too cold &amp; windy.

Old wood that one leaves to the graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made &amp; of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, &amp; if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood than the young better, because it is harder than
the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile &amp; short &amp; slow to
grow.





Molding with cuttlefish bone

Guard against keeping them in a damp place, for they are
very prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the bone
in two, then even it out with a knife. And on a hooked
rooftile, quite dry &amp; quite smoothed &amp; covered with
pulverized willow charcoal, rub &amp; smooth the two
halves of the bones. Thus they imbibe this willow
charcoal, which makes them release well &amp; guards against removing
anything. Then, on a counter bone, that is to say a piece of
brick evened to the size of your bone, place
your medal, &amp; then on this one, place the bone,
&amp; press well with some other piece of the same size on the top. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, pounce on top with
willow charcoal &amp; blow lightly, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole bones. All cast work is brittle &amp; subject to
breaking, because the metal expands when cast, &amp; retracts
&amp; condenses under the hammer. That is why one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a chisel, &amp; in this way the
metal retracts. Let it thus escrouir. If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the mold &amp; hollow it
with a penknife to make way for the medal, &amp; then
mold. And if the medal has two sides

Before casting, heat the
bones in order to make them lose only the coldness &amp;
dampness.

When the lead gets too hot, it
calcines.

since the two bones are joined,
co cut them evenly all around, &amp; make notches
e around it in different places which cross over the
join of the two bones, in order to recognize well the
place of the first join. Or else, with little shards of
wood, pierce them, or ma coat the
joins with some clay, &amp; dry. Press, between them
your hands joined between your two knees
&amp; not with a press, because the bones would
crack. Mold also at your leisure &amp; two or three times, until you see
that it is pressed quite tightly together &amp; well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, pounce with some
willow charcoal, for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with oil &amp; with willow
charcoal powder &amp; with a brush, to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not too greasy or oily when you mold in
cuttlefish bone. When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some bone. And cast moderately hot,
which you will know when the bone is about to change
its good whiteness. But when it is too hot, it turns
the bone very red. The proportion of lead
&amp; tin is as much of one as of the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out &amp; of several pieces, make the gate forked with three or
four grooves, and make &amp; direct these grooves to the
place of the thicker parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like straight on the heads, for this attracts the metal &amp; feeds
the figure better. Shake your frame a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. Tin that is too
hot pburns the bone, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out du mo hot from the mold, it risks
breaking.
