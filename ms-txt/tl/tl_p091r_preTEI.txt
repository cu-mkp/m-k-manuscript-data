Grafting

With any tree that has coarser marrow, the graft is awkward
to <-be-> cut well, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, & if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the vine, from all
peaches & apricots.

Apricot trees have a very thin bark, & thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of prune trees & almond trees.

The grafts scarcely <-[illegible]-> take if the cut of the tree is
wet. One needs then to graft in serain & mild
weather, & not too cold & windy.

Old wood that one leaves to the graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made & of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, & if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood <-than the young-> better, because it is harder than
the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile & short & slow to
grow.





Molding with cuttlefish bone

Guard against keeping them in a humid place, for they are
very prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the bone
in two, then even it out with a knife. And on a hooked
roof tile, quite dry & quite smoothed & covered with
pulverized willow charcoal, rub & smooth the two
halves of the bones. Thus they imbibe this willow
charcoal, which makes them release well & guards against removing
anything. Then, on a counter bone, that is to say a piece of
brick evened to the size of your bone, place
your medal, & then on this one, place the bone,
& press well with some other piece of the same size on the top. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, pounce on top with
willow charcoal & blow lightly, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole bones. All cast work is brittle & subject to
breaking, because the metal expands when cast, & retracts
& condenses under the hammer. That is why one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a chisel, & in this way the
metal retracts. Let it thus escrouir. If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the mold & hollow it
with a penknife to make way for the medal, & then
mold. And if the medal has two sides

Before casting, heat the
bones in order to make them lose only the coldness &
moisture.

When the lead gets too hot, it
calcines.
