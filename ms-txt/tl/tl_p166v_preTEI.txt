To the Greek examples, there can be added a psalm of
David of which St. Athanasius makes mention
<-en-> in Sinopsi. It begins Parvus

royal prophet says, <-Manus meae->
Manus meae fecerunt organum et
digiti mei aptarunt psalterium.







Keeping chestnuts

One needs to leave them in their bristled shells until one wants to
eat them. And with this, leave them in a humid place or the
gutter of some roof.

Softening gold

Dissolve caput mortuum in distilled vinegar,
filter & congeal in salt, & cement

Augmenting the color of gold

Put aquafortis of vitriol on hot ashes. Cover the
bottle, that is to say, the mouth, with a tile, then unstop
it & thick fumes will come out; put the gold on this
and it will take on a high color.
