Crocum ferri

It is much sooner made with iron rust than with
filings. For if the vinegar is good, you will
see it boil with large bubbles <-as if it-> on the rust,
as if it were on the fire; on the filings, it does not boil
unless it is put on the fire or hot ashes. However, when the
filings are passed through vinegar, & you have made it
evaporate & heat up, & it is very red, if you do this again for a
second time, the vinegar will have much more strength, & the
crocum will only be finer for it, & redder. Those who
use it to cast in gold <-ven-> buy the
ounce for forty or fifty sous.





It does not harden the molds, and, in scraping, one cannot tell
that they are harder from it. But it makes the mold less dense,
and it drinks in and attracts the gold better.







Plaster

You can mold with it as large a piece as you please. But if you take
your molds from large works & pieces of wood, it
will not release well unless you <-boil-> make your wood
imbibe very hot wax. For the wood absorbs & drinks
& in this way attracts the plaster. You can assume the same
thing for any other large piece of work. But the cure is to
<-l’ab-> saturate <-l’ouvra-> with very
hot wax the work on which you want to cast your plaster. For
by this means, it will not drink it up & will release very
neatly.



If the plaster shrinks, it will always make flashing. Seek the hard
kind and <-it-> put your molds well in the press before
casting.

It is not good when it
shrinks.





Plants difficult to burn in the noyau

Any plant which has a hard stem & like wood is very
difficult to burn in the noyau, such as asparagus,
thyme, & similar things, because they stay as charcoal
in the small conduits, & if they do not reduce well into
ashes, it is not possible to empty them from the mold.
Some reheat them, to do this, two or <-d-> three
times. Others, putting several plants together in the mold,
pass through <-threads-> the plants & the <-es->
<-molds-> circle of earth,
which is to receive the tempered sand, <-plusi->



This does not proceed from plants that have a stem with lines, because
rosemary burns well, but it is in the nature of certain
plants.
