Founders of small works
of tin


        
Make sure the pegs of your
frame enter easily so that [<-n->]
<-in opening-> the frame will easily open
without shifting anything, and that your frames
fit well together, & that the table is
quite even.

They usually cast with solder, even the things that should
not come out empty, for the latter require fine & soft tin,
which however would not release, & would not come out empty if it
was mixed or had some looking-glass tin <-mix->
in it, just like they put in a little of it in soft
tin. They engrave their works on stones of which are made the
sharpening stones or files of barbers, which are found in
great flakes near the mountains, & resemble
slate. They are of three colors: reddish, which is not as
perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire
<-& as->, one <-dard-> of the color of dark
slate, the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they
imprint it on carton as thick as one
finger, to serve as a pattern, then with a
little compass & little matching iron fittings, they
engrave their figures, having first flattened their stones &
worn down one against the other, they make their <-p->
molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins
perfectly, because the stones render themselves even. Before
casting, they rub the mold with tallow, which has quickly
absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking fine powder of
quicklime in a linen, they pounce the mold while
beating with the linen on top, then blow a little on top
to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents, if
the work is largish. They make them in this manner, as you see
represented here. They pierce a hole in some place on the medal that is
least visible. And then with a borer they pierce the mold on
the side of the medal.

And if they want their work to stay pierced in any place, they drive in
a bit of cork at this place in the mold. And
the lead or tin

 will not attach to it. 



Try to engrave with distilled vinegar.




Try calcined oyster shells. They are said to be
excellent for molding.
