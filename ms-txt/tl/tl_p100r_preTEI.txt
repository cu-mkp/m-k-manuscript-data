Gold color

To quickly make a layer of or <-on->
mat on canvas or other oil panel, one makes fatty
walnut oil in the sun or on the
fire, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way,
although there is neither lead nor ceruse. And with this,
grind massicot, minium & other desiccatives,
not verdet nor orpiment, for they cause the
gold to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the
weather is not serain & dry, do not smooth it,
for if the weather is musty & humid, it would
turn black.







Portraying from nature

One needs to carefully observe the eyes, the nose &
the beard, for these three things make strong resemblance.







Gemstones

You need to pestle your materials in a mortar of
thick glass & encased & stuck with mastic
into another mortar of wood, in order that it does not
break. This can serve for perfumers. & <-the
t-> the pestle, also of glass.

Vitrified saltpeter



Being melted with pebbles, it makes the glass very white.
But before, one needs to calcine it on a hot tile or shovel. And that which will remain from the vapor, mix it with as
much of the white calcined pebbles. It is true that, in the
little furnace, it does not clarify well. But for large panes of
glass, it makes the glass very clear & white &
clean.







Windows that the sun will not pass

Take the aforesaid calcined saltpeter & expose it to
a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a
liquor which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the
sun will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One
needs to put the saltpeter on some clean <-thing->
place & <-it-> put glowing charcoals on it,
and continue all over until it no longer burns.





It also serves for melting & for adding to alkali salt
for cleaning hands.
