If you want to cast gold, silver, copper, or
latten, it is necessary that they be perfectly red &
inflamed on the inside when you cast, & perfectly reheated two
times if there is something inside to be burnt & cleaned.

The molds of animals that one burns must be heated in
such a way that the animal burns. But if it has thick bones, it is
troublesome to pull out & ☿ often breaks
some fine things by its weightiness. One does not put
☿ in molds that can open. This readily
happens with flowers, the mold of these does not open because
they are made all in one go.

When you want to reheat your molds, put the clamps
on the joints, in order that, when reheating, they do not bend,
contract, or break. This is done after the gate is made.

The scrapings of the mold can still be used, using them in
place of brick, after having reheated them, & also the
pieces of the molds that have been used. One lutes with it
also important things, like works of gold or silver. One
also reheats it, & prepares it with <-se-> sal 
ammoniac water, as spat from Germany, & it is
excellent sand for frames for all metals.

The molds of things which one needs to burn inside the mold are
<-souf-> not opened until the thing that is inside is
burnt, like with molds of crayfish, crabs,
stag beetles, portraits & pieces of sulfured
black wax, which do not release well.

One ought not to mold on brick or wood because they
<-l’ea-> drink & attract water too soon, and
do not allow the sand to set. It would never be better than on a
fresh clay slab. Yet, I have experienced that grey
earth dries the mold too soon. The yellow is
better.



For medals and flat things it is necessary that the sand be thick
enough wet, because it sets quickly. And when the sand is thus thick,
one can hit and shake the table where the mold is
placed, to make it run everywhere. But when the sand is thin, like for
flowers and plants, one ought not to hit, nor when there is something
attached with wax or another thing that is subject to coming off,
like crayfish legs or similar things. And if the sand is, by
chance, too thick, you promptly put in it some
[<-pour->] water. Having put the sand in
water, <-it-> examine that it is thick at the bottom &
thin on top. The thinnest is cast at the beginning, and then blow,
& the thickest at the end in order to fortify the
mold.
