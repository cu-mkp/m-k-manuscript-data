  Molds  For those which in which one needs to burn something and which do not open before being reheated, one does not make any casts before it is reheated. For large molds in which the gate is big and ample, it is necessary that the gate be well notched &amp; scratched, in order that the weight of the metal does not go with much force. They make hardly any flashing if they are pressed. But before pressing them, put between them and the press some pieces of plump &amp; thick felt, which is hardly yet crushed, for it fills the concavities &amp; keeps the mold from cracking. The clamps should be placed before reheating or drying it.  When the earth from which you make the earthen slab to arrange your animal is too soft, the points that you put in it come out easily &amp; come undone when you cast in the sand, &amp; thus the mold spoils and the shape comes undone. Therefore, when you recognize that your slab will be too tender &amp; soft, spread on top some hot ashes &amp; blow with the bellows.   Sand  If there is not enough good feather alum or crocum, it will easily crack in the fire. But if it is mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. It is recognized to be good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes water when one quenches it &amp; rends breaks easily because the alum &amp; the crocum render it spongy. On the contrary, bad sand, which is only of plaster &amp; brick, &amp; little mixed with alum, breaks easily in the fire &amp; hardens in water. Cast, if possible, all in one go.   Molds  Even though you cast in lead, the molds want to be well dried, especially when they are large, and one needs to redden them on the outside &amp; keep them in continuous heat until they no longer smoke from inside. Do not place them to reheat at different times, but continue once you have started. And do not place them to cool in the cold, with for they would crack, but leave them to become lukewarm near the fire, &amp; when they are still of such a heat as you have noticed before by putting your finger in the hole, cast. And when the mold is large, it needs more time to reheat &amp; dry, &amp; one needs to cast hotter.
