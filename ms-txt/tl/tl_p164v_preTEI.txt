Molds



For those <-which-> in which one needs to burn something and
which do not open before being reheated, one does not make any casts
before it is reheated. For large molds in which the gate is big
and ample, it is necessary that the gate be well notched &
scratched, in order that the weight of the metal does not go with
much force. They make hardly any flashing if they are pressed. But before
pressing them, put between them and the press some pieces
of plump & thick felt, which is hardly yet crushed, for it fills the concavities & keeps the mold from
cracking. The clamps should be placed before reheating or
drying it.





When the earth from which you make the earthen
slab to arrange your animal is too soft, the points that
you put in it come out easily & come undone when you cast in the
sand, & thus the mold spoils and the shape comes undone.
Therefore, when you recognize that your slab will be too tender & soft, spread on top some hot ashes & blow with
the bellows.







Sand



If there is not enough good feather alum or
crocum, it will easily crack in the fire. But if it is
mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. It is recognized to be
good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes water
when one quenches it & <-rends-> breaks
easily because the alum & the crocum render
it spongy. On the contrary, bad sand, which is only of plaster &
brick, & little mixed with alum, breaks easily in the
fire & hardens in water. Cast, if possible, all in one
go.







Molds



Even though you cast in lead, the molds want to be well
dried, especially when they are large, and one needs to redden them on
the outside & keep them in continuous heat until they no longer
smoke from inside. Do not place them to reheat at different
times, but continue once you have started. And do not place them
to cool in the cold, <-With-> for they would crack,
but leave them to become lukewarm near the fire, & when they are still of such a heat as you have noticed before by putting
your finger in the hole, cast. And when the
mold is large, it needs more time to reheat & dry, & one
needs to cast hotter.
