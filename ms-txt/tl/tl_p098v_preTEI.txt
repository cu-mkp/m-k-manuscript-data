Small dogs

Small dogs who should be water-dogs are recognized by this, that
they have a larger muzzle than others.





Salted artichokes

One puts them whole & not too ripe in a firkin that one
fills with brine. Then, one serves them all
year among salads, raw with oil & vinegar,
for being thus prepared, they take long to cook. But take heed to test
your brine with an egg, for if it is good & strong
enough, the egg will float on top. If not, it is not strong
enough and would not preserve the fruits.





Trees

Which bear fruits quickly are aged and scarcely last.





Birds

Which have been fed by the rod do not whistle among the
company of others if they are not in a separate cage. For teaching them to whistle well, one needs to take them from the nest before they can
see & cover them with down or a hare skin. Thus,
having not seen their father and known his voice, they better learn the whistle
that one teaches them.





Founding

The putty is made of burnt earth which has
served in the founding; this is earth bourre bolvene,
in <-[illegible]-> which one has founded. One grinds it on a big
stone, & with this one makes the
<-cope of-> first coat of the cope of
bells, where there are letters & works, & <-le->
only needs to be reheated in the flame of straw, and molds very
neatly.

The earth which molds en noyau is subject to making
it porous, if you do not rub well with a brush or your
finger the piece to be molded, which should be well
oiled. And do it coat by coat, & not all at once.
