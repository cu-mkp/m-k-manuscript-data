  Extraction of regulus ℞ one lb of antimony, half a lb black soap, and half a lb of tartar from Montpellier. Once the whole is pulverized, one needs to boil in a varnished earthenware pot on a big fire while stirring the whole often with a pick of wood or iron, &amp; the said soap will be consumed and burn off and the rest will stay as if red, and it will be necessary that it is reduced by a third. Then one needs to cast it on a tile and it will turn blackish. One will need to melt this four or five times and pour it on the flat tile and then you will have the regulus drawn from antimony. Others pulverize the antimony &amp; mix it with saltpeter &amp; pulverized tartar, as much of one as of the other, &amp;, having heated a pot or crucible red hot, they put a little of it at a time, &amp; se turn their back for fear of the fumes, and continue thus until everything is put in, and strengthen the fire until everything is thoroughly melted &amp; melt it again several times.   Lead, tin They become brittle having been put back to melt often or for a long time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one melts a saulmon, the tin thickens at the bottom if, while casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to melt little lead &amp; the or tin &amp; stir to renew it at each melt. The antimony renders them breakable. The looking-glass tin whitens them. One Pewterers put in on the fine tin one lb of looking-glass tin per one quintal of fine tin &amp; two lb &amp; a half or three lb of red &amp; soft cauldron copper, which is better than latten. There is fine &amp; soft tin &amp; brittle tin. The brittle one is cast in grille by the pewterers to sell it better. O They come out better &amp; more neatly in stone molds than in a copper mold, because copper is fatty &amp; sticks unless one heats the mold well or one casts large works. Three quarters of lead per one lb of soft tin, makes a very liquid line &amp; proper for casting, which has a shine like a mirror. Sandiver lightens them. And all things that thoroughly lighten metals &amp; remove their thickness &amp; dense nature &amp; render them like liquid like water, render them proper for casting, for it is the thickness that prevents them from running. Soft tin is more even com than the brittle one, which is whiter and seems to be burnished like a mirror.  To alloy well tin &amp; lead, one needs to melt one by itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it often on the marble or the square tile. And when you will see it become quite even like &amp; shiny as if it were burnished, it is good. For sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much lead &amp; sometimes due to too much tin. There is some tin which takes more lead than another. Common tin is the one that is mixed with lead.
