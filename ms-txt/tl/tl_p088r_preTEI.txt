Osier

It can be planted, like the bramble, on both sides, &
those who plant the large feet against a slope say that it makes a
larger stump. But it only has a point at the top, for it grows
higher.





Mortars

Fine copper mortars do not throw fire, as long as
the iron pestle is not tempered. The
metal mortar does the same, because it is
sour. One makes, for this purpose, the bottom of large mortars
from fine copper.





Varnish

Turpentine oil, turpentine & good eau-de-vie
to render it desiccative. Heat it without mixing on the chafing
dish, so that it mixes <-pu-> by itself when
melting. Next, test on a very clean knife, & you will know
then if it has enough body & if it does not run too much.





Grafting

One finds by experience that the graft that <-is->
has its entrance into the incision on the sunny side takes very rarely
when it is also bent.





Baker

Dust keeps wheat from becoming infested with weevils. And to clean
it well when it is stained & as if rusty, pass ashes through
the sieve & mix them with the wheat, then
boult the whole with a boulting cloth of rough cloth or
canvas. The ashes will pass through & your
wheat will stay yellow, clean & very
beautiful.





Looking-glass tin

It makes the substance whiter.
