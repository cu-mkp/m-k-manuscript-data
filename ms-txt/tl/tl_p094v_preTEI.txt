The gold grips are made by putting underneath thin yellow
canvas or a different canvas yellowed with chalk. And this
canvas is set with glue or the aforesaid gum, this
is in order that the thread holds better on it. These are made of
cords like the silk ones, & between two cords one sets one or
two threads to make it show up better. The silver kind is
made similarly, and there is not as much trouble as with silk,
and even less because it takes more to twist silk, because one
needs to twist it twice. A grip of fine gold is worth 18 or 20
sous.

The best sword point is the sage leaf form.

This long plank on which the sword is attached & laid down to
furbish it is called the

The upper is called the stick of the

There is an iron which is made like a halberd point,
square, & of very even steel, & well filed,
which is called the
grateau, which
serves to [<-to->] smooth the traces of the
file on sword guards & to give an edge to swords after they
have been ground, which is better than with a stone or a
sharpening stone, which quite often makes scratches.
