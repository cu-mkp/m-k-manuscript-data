Knife for cutting the nose or a
finger




    


This is a well-furbished knife, nailed through the
middle in such a way that it easily moves to one side & the other
& the side <-[illegible]-> A, as readily as the side B, is hidden 
inside its handle marked C. The two tenons you see at the tip of
the knife are for locking it on one side or the other against a
nail which is at the butt of the said handle, in order 
that, when one wants to press hard on something to
cut it, it does not come out from the handle. You may allow the
side marked B to cut for demonstration purposes, but not
much, but the side that is notched <-A-> and marked A must
not cut. <-It-> It is sufficient that it be furbished well. And
also the notch needs to be as thick as the back of a
knife in order that it cannot cause pain. And you
will only show the part of the knife which is not notched, for
the side with the notch needs to be <-mar-> hidden
inside the handle. And when you want to cut the nose
or a finger, pretend to sharpen your knife on the
thigh and, while <-while-> doing this, turn the
knife deftly. & the part with the notch, which you will
cover <-l-> with one finger, will come into
your hand, and you will place the notch, colored with
brazilwood rosette or black cherry juice, upon
the nose.





The conjuror ought not to amuse himself by watching what he
is doing, but look at the spectators and give them plenty of
good hocus-pocus words so that they look at his face & not
at his hands.






X For relighting an extinguished candle between your
hands without blowing




X Take a small stick of well dried <-between->
wicker and cut from it a small piece like a
toothpick, & <-it m-> put one end
between your index finger & middle finger and
clasp both your hands, fingers well joined, and pass
them deftly around the lit candle as if you wanted to cover it
with them, & your wicker will light, & immediately remove
your hands <-jo-> thus clasped, &
immediately put out the candle. And then put your
hands around it again as if you wanted to cover it, & your
little [<-of light->] <-p->
wicker light, by means of the smoke
that you are holding with your two palms the candle
will light. Then immediately extinguish your wicker &
secretly cast it aside.
