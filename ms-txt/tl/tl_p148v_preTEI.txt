Molding turtles

Next, reassemble the parts of your mold and clamp
carefully all the joints, as much as above & below as on the sides,
having not forgotten to notch the joints of the molds, as with
others. Having clamped it all, undo the clamps on the
side & not the others. And thus, your mold of several
pieces <-sem-> will open as if it were only in two
halves. If you want to mold hollow, make in the middle of the <-of
the part-> mold of the belly a hole, from side to side,
which, inside, is of such capacity that the end of a little
finger can almost enter it, widening like a clervoise
the outside of the hole. This is to cast the core. But note
that all these difficulties would be nothing if you wanted
to mold hollow, because you could mold your turtle in two pieces
<-[illegible]-> and burn it inside, as with other animals, and it
would be done quickly. But since the turtle is massive & 
would be weighty if it is not hollow, one considers it better molded in
this way hollow, and in <-cha-> this fashion, to
make a mold well, one really needs three
days. Take heed in hollow & fanciful
molds to have some strong plaster, which endures the
fire without bursting, if it is possible. But if you cannot have any
such, mix a little more feather alum & add to it
also some crocum, which fortifies it & makes it so that the
flashing, if there is any, comes out so finely that it is easily undone.
Also, do not forget to tighten your molds well with a press to avoid flashing which is made either when the
mold is not well joined or when it bursts. To repair, if the
features are not apparent enough, retrace them lightly with a
burin, then soften them with a small chisel. The flashing
is removed with the chaple, a type of
burin. For the lumps & scales, they are made either with a
little gouge or a little round cutting-punch, or with
the point of a small chisel, not tempered, & struck on a
small file. 

Make this hole before <-molding->
joining your molds.
