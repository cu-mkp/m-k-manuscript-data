Wax portraits



If they are painted with colors on the wax, &amp; if the
wax is not tinted &amp; mixed with color within, the color lifts
off &amp; is undone if you mold them en noyau, but the portrait
is not spoiled. One needs to oil them lightly, bathing in
eau-de-vie &amp; tempering with hot water. If they are
varnished, one needs to mold them two or three times to lift off the
varnish, which sticks to the mold. After it is removed,
you will be able to mold nealy. If they are on wood, one needs to
saturate the wood with very hot melted wax, for otherwise the
mold would be attached to it. Lead white is much better
for mixing with white wax than ceruse, for lead
white is firmer &amp; whiter.




Chiseling



If the small chisel has passed through some part of a portrait,
one needs to repair &amp; retrace it all. Otherwise, it would look like a
joined piece.






Fish glue



Beat it very fine &amp; thin on a well-cleaned anvil, &amp;
next wet it with eau-de-vie over ch hot
ashes &amp; a low fire, &amp; it will be quickly melted; &amp; if it
is not strong &amp; thick enough, add eau-de-vie. And take heed
them not to put it to melt in a fatty vessel, but in
a new one, if you can. It is melted on the fire &amp; is also dried
quickly on the fire, but it may be warmed from a distance once on the
work. It holds strongly. With it one joins flowers &amp; delicate things
of gold, of silver, of tin &amp; other materials,
which are in danger of spoiling if soldered.





Tin and lead



They are beaten very thin without itself. And the tin
does not sour &amp; crack as lead often does,
Ma although it is more fatty, but one reheats it
under hot ash. And it is necessary to beat them with several
leaves together.
