Sal ammoniac and iron dross

I have pulverized sal ammoniac, dried well in the fire &amp;
in a hot bronze mortar, and passed it through the
double sieve; it became very fine. But to render it even more
delicate, I have ground it dry on porphyry. Then, I mixed
it with pulverized &amp; finely ground iron dross, in the same
way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief without being
moistened in the serain, or in the
cellar, or otherwise with the napkin, &amp; it
releases very neatly.




Sand

Molders from Foix who cast their ur 
medals crosswise, use crocum ferri 
and calcined slate. It is for very flat things.




That any sand can be rendered good


Artisans who work in large works &amp; who need to further
their profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she
does not sell her wares to her children, and to also save the time they would
use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing sands, seek
the one of the s mines,
which is not too fatty, the one that is a kin of earth, not too lean &amp;
consequently without bond, but rather that which is pulled from the
depths of the sand-bed in bricks &amp; clods that show
its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which
has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found soft
when handling it between the fingers. And
because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous
areas or lean territories, &amp; akin to the 
arene, it cannot be found in in the
surroundings of all the bonnes villes where
artisans willingly gather. And thus, if they do
not have it close to their house, they prefer to have it come
from afar, like from Lyon, Venice, Paris near the
Sainct Chappelle &amp; similar places, rather than prepare it.
However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the
sand from a mine
