  For bringing a cannon over land  If you have To bring a cannon, one needs a hundred pioneers or more to flatten the tracks by levelling ditches &amp; others obstacles, such as trees, stone mounds &amp; similar things to make gabions on the way. Once one is close to the place one wants to batter, the gunner goes at night to reconnoiter the most convenient place to mount the battery  Know the magazines of France for the artillery.  It is good if the platform is slightly inclined toward the front because the piece is more quickly mounted for battery &amp; holds the blast better &amp; batters more fiercely.   &amp; if he does not see well, one gives a false alarm in order that those on the inside throw torches. Very often, one batters where it is strongest because the assailed, disdaining the battery, do not make repairs there. Commonly, there are not many garrets &amp; other defenses in that place. And when one has made a breach at the strongest part &amp; the cannon removed, it will surprise the assailed. One approaches fortified towns at night, but to poorly fortified towns, pioneers bring gabions and carry once these are placed, one puts some boards or planks behind the gabions to keep the pioneers safe, while behind, they fill the gabions with some earth by means of their shovels. And while one does this, one raises some false alarm on another side. And before, one has   Fowlers  are those which have a reinforcement inside, in the entire space which contains the powder, and the ball can only a roll up to the opening of the said chamber.

The gabions The pioneers carry the boards to make a level ground or a platform of four fingers or half a foot thick, and one sets them into the earth. The platform is five or six cano feet larger than the wheels of the cannon on each side m if there is only one cannon. But if there are more, the platforms touch. The distance which is between the pieces is the width of two gabions. As long as the battery lasts, the gunners sleep &amp; eat close to a cannon.

And there one goes to get powder in bags or frails. And each piece has its own frail for loading three or four times. Then, when the cannon is set on the platform, one puts a board that is proof of an arquebus between two gabions. Then a gunner loads it with a ladle, &amp; with the rammer which is at len the other end of the ladle, two men ram the powder as much as they can, in nine or ten pushes, until they find the powder to be hard &amp; well-compacted. Next, another puts hay or straw and the r others ram a little. Another puts the ball and the hay-bearer puts in as much of it as before &amp; one rams a little. Some put wooden bungs but this runs the risk of making the piece burst. And where one has to fire many cannon shots, one would need many bungs, which would cost much to carry. Once the cannon is loaded, xx or xxv pioneers push it forward with bars, keeping to one side behind the gabions without taking off the board until the cannon reaches it. Once the cannon is in front, the gunner mounts it with the wedges which are at the back, taking the sight on each side and then in the middle. Then another who is nearby gives fire. Each gunner cannon needs 3 gunners: the loader, the one who aims, the one who gives fire. Sometimes, against a camp or into a breach, one shoots cartridges, made as you have elsewhere, or else one uses a basan full of flint stones, cart nails &amp; similar. P A ch cannon must not move unless it has two harnesses, be they of wood or iron. And to furnish the wheels, powder box, and other furniture of the cannon, one needs seven quintals and a half of iron. Pour les pre The best battery is done at a curtain wall, some say, for that is, as if at an bieve angle, for by doing this you shake loose several stones.  Some put small wheels of the piece and a thick board to the end of the carriage of the piece in order that it may be drawn more quickly and without making a noise. Others put leather all around the the wheels &amp; also put leather soles or shoes on the horses’ hooves in order that one does not hear them.
