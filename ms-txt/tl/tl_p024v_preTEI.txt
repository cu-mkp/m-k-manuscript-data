For bringing a cannon over land



<-If you have-> To bring a cannon, one needs a hundred
pioneers or more to flatten the tracks by levelling ditches
& others obstacles, such as trees, stone mounds
& similar things to make gabions on the way. Once one is close to
the place one wants to batter, the gunner goes at
night to reconnoiter the most convenient place to mount the
battery

artillery.



        
It is good if the platform is slightly inclined toward the front because
the piece is more quickly mounted for battery & holds the blast
better & batters more fiercely.

    


& if he does not see well, one gives a false alarm in order
that those on the inside throw torches. Very often, one batters where it
is strongest because the assailed, disdaining the battery, do not make repairs there.
Commonly, there are not many garrets & other defenses in
that place. And when one has made a breach at the strongest part & the
cannon removed, it will surprise the assailed. One approaches
fortified towns at night, but to poorly
fortified towns, pioneers bring gabions and
<-carry-> once these are placed, one puts some boards or planks
behind the gabions to keep the pioneers safe, while behind,
they fill the gabions with some earth by means of their
shovels. And while one does this, one raises some false alarm
on another side. And before, one has 




        
Fowlers
 are those which have a
reinforcement inside, in the entire space which contains the powder, and the
ball can only <-a-> roll up to the opening of the said
chamber. These do not penetrate so much & are irritating to load but
they do not heat up as quickly.
    


fired a volley at the defenses.
[<-The gabions->] The pioneers carry the
boards to make a level ground or a platform of four
fingers or half a foot thick, and
one sets them into the earth. The platform is five or six
<-cano-> feet larger than the wheels of the cannon
on each side <-m-> if there is only one cannon. But if
there are more, the platforms touch. The distance which is between the
pieces is the width of two gabions. As long as the battery
lasts, the gunners sleep & eat close to a cannon. In
small spaces, one does not bother to dig trenches to reach the pieces
but one puts plenty of gabions that are high & goes running to them. In large

    


              
A steel touch-hole
is
put in the cannons in the manner of a screw so it will not be damaged
during firing like the others very quickly will be. But these screws
are prone to blow off & cause damage to the gunner. There
is nothing for it but to use a proper touch-hole.
    


places one digs trenches. There are always in trenches or behind
barricades <-some-> some companions-in-arms on guard duty to defend
the pieces. One keeps the small powder magazine, of three or four
kegs, separately,






A touch-hole at the level
 of
the breach is the best because in [<-in->] this way the cannon hardly pushes
back.
