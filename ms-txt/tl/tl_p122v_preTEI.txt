Cleaning the bowl and the spoon with which one
tempers the sand

Be careful to clean, as soon as & quickly after you have cast,
your bowl & your spatula or spoon with
which you temper your sand, because <-il-> if it dries in
them, it crumbles & falls into the fresh sand & makes a hole or
a fault in the work. Also, when the mold is reheated, these
little pieces crust up & flake off & prevent neat
casting.





Molding hollow

Wax on its own cools too quickly & does not run well
everywhere, & tallow keeps its heat well & runs
everywhere, but on its own it is not good. But when wax &
tallow are mixed, the work is all the better. Crayfish &
other small animals can easily be molded hollow for the body, but as for
the legs, it will be awkward.





The first part of the mold, that is, the first cast on the
clay slab, cracks more readily in the fire than the
second.







Molding medals and flat things

You do not have to make the gate with legs thus


, but rather in this way


, which embraces the medal well. For the other way, with legs, is only
done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, which is
wide and in one piece, works better for flat medals. But take heed
that all gates be very thin close to the medal & almost not as thick
as the medal, if it is not very thin like paper. And then, from
the medal toward the gate, thicken it as it goes, for it comes out better
thus. If the gate is thick at the entry to the medal, the work will
never come out well. Make sure that <-desp-> it is moderately 
thick from the half of the gate at the top, & from the same
half at the bottom very thin. Do not forget to make grooves
<-at the hau-> in the top of the gate to prevent that the
metal runs furiously.
