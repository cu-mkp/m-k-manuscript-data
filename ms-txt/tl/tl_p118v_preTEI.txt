Casting in frames

The same sand that was used in the cooked noyaulx,
composed, as is said, of plaster, brick & feather alum, is excellent for casting in frames, and I
have experienced it thus: I pestled the pieces which had come out of
noyau molds in a mortar, dragging the
pestle because this sand is very soft. I did not
pass it through the sieve because the feather alum mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass, but I
ground finely upon marble what seemed to me too coarse.
And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with sal ammoniac
water, made of sal ammoniac, as much as two
walnuts, in a bottle of common water, the
same size as a bottle in which one boils tisane, or in a
good pot of water, so that you find <-d->
the water moderately salty. I mixed throughout <-water
of-> half a glass  of sal ammoniac, <-two
ault-> two <-au t-> silver
spoonfuls of eau-de-vie.
<-J’a-> Having thus moistened the sand in such a fashion
that it gives a good hold, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my
medal with charcoal pulverized with a file, to rid it of
oil and all other grease, which are necessary to avoid,
for they would <-make-> hinder a good release. I blew on my medal
& molded it, and the female part of the frame once
filled, I marked & made a line on the reverse <-of
the-> & edge of the medal & on the nearby sand as well. In
order that the second frame <-s’em-> take the
imprint thereupon to denote the place for making the cast, <-having
filled-> <-the female part of the frame being filled-> I
uncovered the outline of the medal and pounced the whole side with
pulverized charcoal, and then filled the male part with sand.
<-Once fai-> I separated the frame and did not hit the
corners of the <-d-> medal to make it release, because
that knocks the sand & makes it <-esp-> crumble.
Rather, I struck the back of the frame, retaining the obverse of
the medal on the bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not
released thus, I would have waited to remove it until the
frames had been dried out over fire. I lit <-the-> a row
of charcoals between two little trivets of iron in the
form that you see, and put the back <-the-> & reverse of the
frames thereupon & the imprint on top, because in this
way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, from
being too moistened they should crack, it is on the back, which <-pr->
takes the harshest fire, & the imprint remains safe &
whole.

For better, one needs to reheat the sand used for the noyau
before using it in frame, until it no longer
contracts.



Excellent sand


Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, to cover
the medal with. 



For medals & flat things, the true heat of lead &
tin is when it is melted gently.



Note that I filled the frame before pressing it and did not
hit it at all, but rather pressed it only with the strength of my
hands, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure
your frame that it does not shift at all, & if you put some
wetted sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.



Make the gate so that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the
medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part. Do
not forget the vents.
    

    

    


To dry frames is to rid them of humidity so that they no
longer smoke, being nevertheless very hot.




Reheating is to redden the frame, which is done for
gold and for silver.
