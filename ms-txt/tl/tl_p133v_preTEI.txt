Bubbles and little holes which are found in the
mold



This readily comes about when you cast two or three small
molds, one after the other, in the same bowl, for the last
one is cast from the bottom & thickest of the bowl,
which readily becomes porous. The thinnest casts more finely & more
neatly, provided that one blows strongly enough when casting on the tempered
& cast sand in order to dissipate these small bubbles.





When the sand is cast thickly, it readily becomes porous









Thing that does not release



One needs to cut it to make it burn in the mold, but cut it
with chisels in one go, in order that the blood does
not fall on the mold & does not create filth, which,
once reheated, is difficult to remove. Next, put your mold in
the oven or similar heat, in order that it dries promptly &
retracts before making a crust or mold on the
mold.

When you mold small female lizards and you want to uncover the part
first molded, begin to uncover the heads & you will recognize its
place by the pin. Do not attempt to uncover the legs until you
have uncovered the rest of the body, in order that the stripped body, as
it moves, does not remove the legs from their place, where it is
vexing to put them back. When you remove the little points which
hold the legs, fix them & press them with something, in order that,
when removing the pin, they are not removed from their place,
or, in the end, you can put them back with some wax.







Various animals entwined



You can entwine a snake <-entwined-> with a
lizard, one biting the other, or a snake that eats a
frog or a wall lizard <-s-> &
suchlike. But because these entwinings can in no way make a good
release, cut what you can & leave the rest to burn. And to keep a
wall lizard, which is small, in the mouth of the
snake, which is raised & needs to be supported in the air
<-po-> because the head of the snake is posed
    raised, put underneath the wall lizard <-se->
an elevation of earth suited to support it. And if you put your
mold in the oven, the animal, drying promptly, will retract
& will burn better afterward. <-if you see-> These entwinings are
also made to cover a wound or fault in the animals, which one usually
wounds when one catches them. Also, do not forget to attach & join
with some wax <-s->, finely applied with hot
iron wire, all the parts of the animal which pass one on top
of the other or those that you notice are not well fixed on the 
<-wax-> earthen slab, in order that the tempered sand
does not remove it. And it is to
