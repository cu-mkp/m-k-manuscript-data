 As I saw that they did not smoke anymore &amp; that, scratching
the back &amp; the front of the cast &amp; having found that they are
rough &amp; firm &amp; hard on one side and the other, which is a good
sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some fine
tin f, one lb, &amp; one ounce
of lead, fine &amp; new. I melted it in a crucible until
it was, a little as it were, a little red. Being in this way quite hot
I smoked &amp; not p &amp; being ready to cast, &amp; not
before, I smoked with the smoke of a tallow candle all
sides of my frames &amp; imprint &amp; cast &amp; everything.
I set my frame, well joined, in the press. I drew my
crucible from the fire. I left it a little pass so that
the redness at the bottom of the crucible could die
down. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three
grains of something like pitch rosin, &amp; at the same time the
size of a bean of looking-glass tin, &amp; I
mixed, &amp; stirred the crucible a little, and I cast. And the
medal came out as neat as the principal. I smoked it with the
candle &amp; cleaned it with small
brushes.



Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
lower, will come out better &amp; make the cast longish. And when you
cast several medals in a large frame, they will come out
better.





Advice about the above

Good tin is that which is hard as silver
&amp; soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
tin &amp; alloyed as is said.

Looking-glass tin must not be smoked mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.

 Nor must the forms be smoked until then.

 If the sand shrinks in the frame, this means that it must
be reheated &amp; reddened on the fire.

Good sand, when moistened, does not stick at all to the
hand when pressed.

The perfect sand for the frame is
aspalt, which is found in
Germany, which is soft as flour &amp; almo
when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.



Nota that the cast must be thin &amp; hardly thick
in order that it does not overtax the material, and must not
exceed the thickness of a the width of a grain of
wheat; likewise for tin, which wants to be cast
very thinly. For lead, a little thicker. There is no need to make
the vents very large &amp; deep either.


For frames, the sand that you use for the noyau, of the
aforesaid composition, is excellent. But in washing, crushing &amp;
reheating it several times, it must be corrupt from its nature &amp; no longer fit to make a hold &amp; to mold en noyau.
