Sal ammoniac wate[<-e->]r

The size of two chestnuts of pulverized
sal ammoniac suffices in a pot of water,
and to the tongue, you find the water
moderately salty, for too much is not good.







Sanguine

To clean the various colors of lead & tin, one
pulverizes sanguine, & with some small bristle brushes, one rubs the
molded <-e-> work.







Crab and crayfish



These are the hardest to mold, & whoever molds them well will mold
many other very delicate things.







Lizards

When one takes them with two fingers from the
sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their
<-g-> mouth, then one takes the <-a->
end of its lower mandible with the end of the
fingernail, & next, with the upper mandible,
he bites the nail, but he cannot pass through, but he
clenches very strongly. And if he were to bite living flesh it would
<-au-> not let go, & there would be no better remedy
than to promptly cut off his head. In the spring, as they
have changed skin, they are more beautiful.





The small lizards that one takes in the summer, the
size of small female lizards, grey on the back & green on
the belly, are very appropriate to cast in silver &
gold, or other metal, because they have rougher scales
than the female lizards & show better.

Composition of sand

Once everything is reheated as said above, take four 4 full
crucibles of plaster, two 2 of brick,
& one of feather alum. Do not pass through the
sieve to mix <-may-> because the
alum would not pass. Mix with your
hands until neither one nor the other, neither white
nor red, can be discerned among the other. If your plaster were not
strong, do not mix in at all so much feather alum, because
it softens the molds. Take heed also that your sand is not hot
(since it has immediately been reheated) <-C-> when you
will want to mix it with water, for this <-them->
makes molds too soft & breakable.







You may sometimes diminish the quantity of plaster if you do not
find it strong enough to withstand fire & if it cracks,
<-&-> in order that the part of pestled tiles holds up, with
the feather alum, which you can also increase so that
it creates a better bond.
