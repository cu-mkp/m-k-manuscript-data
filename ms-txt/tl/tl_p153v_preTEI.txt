flour. And to flatten it, take a small stick of
boxwood, very round & of the same thickness
everywhere, which has, at the two ends, a little circle, more raised
than the rest, to give the necessary thickness to the paste. And
then, with this rolling pin, flatten it in such a way that it
is delicate & thin enough. Then apply it on the hollow
of your mold and press on it with some cotton
& your figure will imprint itself in the paste, in relief on
one side & in a hollow form on the other. This done, anoint with a
paintbrush, wetted in a little melted butter, the
part of the paste which is hollow. Then, cut the
excess [<-r->] paste which surpasses the hollow of the
mold <-H->. Anoint your mold also with
olive oil, as you have done with others, place the
clay contour & cast <-s-> your
second mold. And you will have your medal as thin & hollow on one
side as you will want. You can have diverse rolling pins, which will
have ends, some more raised than others, to make various thicknesses, or
use sheets of lead & copper of various thicknesses
or of carton, cut with the rolling
pin.

    




If you were to rub your paste with oil, it would drink the
oil & penetrate up to the mold, which it would
attack. But butter remains on the surface of the paste
& is not imbibed at all. You should not, on these reverse sides,
temper your sand with hot water, for it would melt

 the butter.







Testing the goodness and strength of a sand to be reheated

After it has set, it must be found smooth & easy to cut, and not
rough. It tests better in a large & fantastical mold than
in a small one, for the large one remains long in the fire & the
small one is soon reheated.





Softening gold

Sometimes, there is gold so dry <-il-> that neither
cement nor antimony can soften it. But only
verdet can render it soft.
