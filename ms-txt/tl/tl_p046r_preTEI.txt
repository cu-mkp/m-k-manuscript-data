For the teeth, oil of sulfur

Some people whiten them with confections of
aquafortis; however, one says that this corrupts them
afterward & causes a blackness on them. One says that oil of
sulfur is excellent, but one needs to mix it in this way: take as
much clove oil as can be held in a
walnut shell, and as much rose honey,
& seven or eight drops of oil of sulfur, & mix
it well all together. And after having cleaned the teeth with a
small burin, touch them lightly with a <-end-> little
cotton dipped in the aforesaid oils and leave it there for a
little while, then spit or rinse your mouth with tepid
water, and reiterate two or three times. Oil of sulfur
penetrates & is corrosive, <-and l-> but the
clove oil & the rose honey correct it.
Therefore use it with discretion.
