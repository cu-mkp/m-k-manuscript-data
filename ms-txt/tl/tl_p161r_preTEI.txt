Preparation of sand for frames

After your sand de noyau dalu of gip
of lateribus &amp;
alume jameni was used en noyau,
gather the pieces of molds, break them on a long table
with a large billet in order to pulverizes
them well, and, better yet, sieve it finely. Put
them in some pots into the tilerâ€™s oven or
bread oven, several times when it is well lit, in order that
they become very red. Once cooled, repestle them, if need be, and
sieve. Next, put it in a neat, adequate dish
or semal or vessel, and wet it with clear
water, and grind it &amp; stir with a thick stick until it
is well wetted &amp; washed &amp; the filth goes to the
surface of the water, &amp; continue to stir it thus, like the
gip mat that one prepares to gild with burnished
gold, five or six days, until it is not at all
lumpy. # nota And, each time that
you stir it again, leave it to rest &amp; empty the clear water
which will be on top by tilting or with a bowl or
sponge, and put some clear water back in, &amp; thus
wash &amp; stir it until it is well fine &amp; purged of all
filth. Nota #. Next, leave it a little
to drain and dry, and make from it some little balls tempered
in sal ammoniac water, and once thus d dried
l, put them to reheat at great heat in a reverberatory
furnace, where they should be be quite red, a good space of
time. Once they are reheated in this way, pulverize them &amp; try
to mold something in a frame, having moistened your
powder with sal ammoniac water. And reheat &amp; redden the
frame, &amp; if your sand retracts, one needs to pulverize
again &amp; wet it in sal ammoniac water, reduce into little
balls &amp; reheat it &amp; redden &amp; continue so many times that it
does retract from the frame when you redden it. The main thing
is that it is well reheated, for otherwise the sal ammoniac would
not calcine well &amp; render the sand coarse, &amp; for this reason,
one does not need too much sal ammoniac in it.





# 
Nota that one needs, 
before drying it, to wet it all and le empty the
liquid in another common vessel, leaving the litharge,
in order that the stones &amp; earth remain at the bottom
afterward. One needs to let it rest &amp; empty the water by tilting,
&amp; leave it dry.
