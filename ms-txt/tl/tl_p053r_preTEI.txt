Soldering a vise

It is good that the jaws of the vise should be high to make
a long piece in it, and that the jaws join well to clamp a delicate
object. To solder the nut, after you have forged the
bolt, you  will forge a long iron
strip of such thickness that it can fit
into the notch of the bolt when red hot, & you will bend it
 all around, striking it with a hammer.
Once it is well  wrapped around, you will insert
 the bolt around which
 it is wrapped.


Copper

If, in the fire & melt, it touches the iron, this
iron will be so brittle afterward that it cannot be
forged.


Casting of lead

One mixes it, according to some, halftin &
halflead, and to l'eschheat it,
one mixes in a little sublimate. It casts well in small works in
a cuttlefish bone, provided it is good.


Molding with paper

Boil over hot ashes some cotton in
aquafortis mixed with sal ammoniac, like
aqua regia, and the cotton will become very fine,
like powder. Temper it next it with gummed water & you will mold
very delicately.


Almond trees, apricots

They come in quite straight if one grafts them. And all trees with
pitted fruit, like pavis,
mericotons, alberge,
apricots &c, come in best 
shield grafted on an almond tree.


Casting of lead and copper

Lead & tin come out well in white chalk but
the softer it is the better. The one from Champaigne fetches
the price that is set in Lyon. Burnt & calcined
horse bones mold very neatly.





I believe that the marrow from the horns of oxen or
sheep, that is to say, the spongy bone from the
inside, molds very neatly and is better than bone.



Note that any brittle metal comes out better than the fatty. Also,
lean sand receives & drinks it better than the
dense one.
