Amaranth color

Although it is said to be immortal, it is nonetheless the case that
white wine removes its tint & turns claret-colored, <-on-> & the dry flower ends up white afterward. Note that in this way the
wine, & I have <-p-> tested it. Eau-de-vie does as much.







Drying of oil

If the oil does not dry out, put in massicot &
minium. There is no better oil than that of walnut, for
it dries out neither too soon nor too late.







Casting

The Germans use lead from Flanders because
it is very soft. And to cast better they take lead ore & melt
it, & separate what is melted from the filth &
ore, & pour it into a separate vessel, then <-the
bottom-> they make their cast with it. For the lead must not have been
put to work before, but rather completely new. Some cast into molds
of iron & copper.





or new lead coming from the mine. They melt it twice
in a crucible. In the first one, they purge it of
filth. In the second, they <-en-> make the cast.







Shadows

German painters make their shadows on flesh
color of men with ground jet, stil de grain yellow
& ocher.







Bistre

It is only used in distemper, & with this wood color is
made.







Verdigris and another very beautiful bright green

One ought not to grind it with water alone, for that makes it
die. To render it beautiful in distemper, some grind it with
vinegar, but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To
render it beautiful, grind it with urine & leave to dry.
Then, whenever you like, grind it with oil. And after you have
collected it with the spatula, before finishing to clean the
marble, grind stil de grain yellow on it. And you
will have a very beautiful green.
