bit,  so that  you can
take it out if you need to. And take heed that it is necessary that
these points be of the most delicate iron wire possible
to bear the size of the animals. For, the more delicate it is, the
smaller the hole that it leaves appears. However, one needs 
different thicknesses of these, because  the points which are put in the body
& in thicker places, like under the throat, ought to be longer &
stronger than the ones of the legs & thin parts, where the
needles ought to be subtle & delicate, almost like the
thickest strings of spinets. And it is better that they
be of iron wire, which is firmer than the one of latten.
And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg ought to be
joined to the body, do not put the point there, not to corrupt
it. But place wax, as much as a grain of
millet, between the body &  the end of the tail, then with a bit of
flattened & hot iron wire, touch this wax & join
by lightly pressing. Thus having placed your animal on the
cake shaped like a mandore, place all around a
circle of the same

earth, in this way

 & join everything well together in a circle, then, with a
big knife, with which you have cut your cake to
the right size, trim the outside which exceeds it, & place there a
piece to close it as you see in b. Then, with a small curved
instrument, mark on the inside of the circle the thickness you want
to give to the mold, which will be for a common snake
as thick as two thumbs, in order that when you
cast in your wetted sand, you will see when it is thick enough. All of
this carefully arranged, moisten well everywhere with good eau-de-vie with a paintbrush the body of the animal
which is uncovered. For there is the secret, 
kept well hidden, because everything that will be 
touched by eau-de-vie will undoubtedly come out very
neatly & without  any small eyes or holes
that one calls porosity, which usually come not at the back & in the
thick sides of the mold, but on the edges. And as soon as you
have thus moistened everything with eau-de-vie, cast
in your wetted sand without letting the eau-de-vie dry,
which evaporates promptly. And wet it thus.



and make sure that the point is long according to the height
you want the head, and that it be pointed on both ends. Once placed
thus, plant your snake on the slab of earth, &
arrange the head first and then the rest.



Eau-de-vie in three goes.







If, after you have placed you animal on your claycake, you are distracted with other occupations, rub your
animal with eau-de-vie & under the belly so that it
does not dry & attach itself to the earth



If, when you pierce your animal, it renders water from the bottom
of the side of the belly, on the slab of earth, clean it well
with cotton for the sand that would touch it would be lumpy. If
it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and touch it
& moisten well with eau-de-vie.




Tempering the sand and molding the first cast

Take a bowl of leadedearth of such size that
it can hold the tempered sand, which will be needed  to
fill your mold in one go, which is 
better than in two goes, because if you do not cast the second wet batch
 promptly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the
first one will set & become solid,
