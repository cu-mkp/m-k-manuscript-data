And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in oil, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also serve you to make a seat for gold. Alum water also keeps oil from running.   Seat for gold leaf on parchment or paper Make very clear starch glue &amp; which does not show itself to have body. And make thereof six or five layers, &amp; on the last, once it is half dried, apply your gold.   For cleaning gold leaf applied to iron Rub your weapons or other gilt objects with dry horse dung.   For whitening ceruse Hard-boil eggs, divide them in half &amp; take the yolk out, &amp; between the two halves of the white put a piece of ceruse, &amp; tie them together with thread.
