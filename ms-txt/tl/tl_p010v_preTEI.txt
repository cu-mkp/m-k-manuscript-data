For painting in oil on taffeta without the
oil running

One needs to make a layer of batture, which is made
<-of well-cooked honey & turpentine-> of strong glue 
soaked for 24 hours in water then gently
brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little
honey to soften it, & make it boil all together. And on top
of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in
oil, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also
serve you to make a seat for gold. Alum water also
keeps oil from running.







Seat for gold leaf on parchment or
paper

Make very clear starch glue & which does not show itself to have body. 
And make thereof six or five layers, & on the last, once it is half dried,
apply your gold.







For cleaning gold leaf applied to iron

Rub your weapons or other gilt objects with dry horse
dung.







For whitening ceruse

Hard-boil eggs, divide them in half & take the yolk out,
& between the two halves of the white put a piece of
ceruse, & tie them together with thread. Then boil
in clear water, & it will become entirely black, & thus
the ceruse will be left well purified. Some reheat it over fire & it
becomes very white.
