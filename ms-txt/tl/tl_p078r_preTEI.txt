these drugs melt in a new earthen pot, &
when it will be melted, you will pass it in a clean cloth
& you will see a beautiful varnish.







Another varnish

Take one ounce of spike lavender oil &
heat it over charcoals, & then take a half ounce of
sang d<-e->a
Ra<-ie->c
& grind it coarsely, and then put it into the spike
lavender oil, & then mix it with a stick until you
see that it is melted, and then put it in a glass vial.
And when you want to use it, heat it little by little over the
charcoals. And before putting it down, put down a coat of very
clear glue, & then put it down with a paintbrush.







For making red varnish

Take vermilion & temper it with gum water as well
as with other water, and make it like the other varnish,
& mix this other water like the other varnish, and
then lay it down as before <-for making three green->.







For making <-tr->wood green

Take very strong vinegar, salt, &
rainwater, and one needs to put it all together with
verdigris, and put it in a new earthen vessel
with your wood, & put it in some very warm horse
dung for the space of eight or nine days.
