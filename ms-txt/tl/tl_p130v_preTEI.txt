Molding a crab

It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold it well, because one needs
to proceed differently than with other animals, because its shell is
very difficult to <-mou-> burn & in this case, one
<-it-> needs to sometimes reheat the mold three
or four times. And with all of this, it leaves a hard crust, grey like
ash. But because it does not mold in one piece & one cast
like plants, but rather in two casts like snakes that release
well, one removes this crust, not with quicksilver, which
would do nothing, after it
has been opened, with the very fine point of a penknife with
dexterity, as with the little crusts of the second cast, which enter in
the nooks that the sand or the molded animal made. But,
<-la-> because it has curved legs,
here is the cunning & secret for releasing it.


        
It is painted like a crayfish.

    
Therefore, as you have molded it on
one side, which is on the back, in the same fashion as others, uncover its
belly & all its curved legs. Make your second cast in the same fashion
as others, but as it will have set, keep from opening the mold
until you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because of its curved
legs, you would break everything. In this lies the dexterity. If you
recognize, after having reheated & opened it, that the crust is not
burned enough, reheat until it is.



<-Know that-> For opening the mold, there is
no need to soak it, for once reheated, it will open by itself.




Stag beetle

It is as difficult to burn as a crab, therefore do for it
as you did for the crab.




For molding thin

After you have molded en noyau <-la->
the first <-e figur-> mold, let it dry well
before taking away the figure of wax, <-in order-> in order
that the mold does not corrupt. Next, make a small lasagna of
paste of such thickness as you would like, and having anointed
with butter <-your-> the hollow of your first hollow
mold, adapt the paste to it, and then make your second
mold on top. If you were to anoint with oil, it would be
absorbed & would not be as appropriate as butter.
