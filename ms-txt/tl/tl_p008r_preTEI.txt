when it will be very hot, temper it in the
strongest vinegar that you can. And do this four or five times.
Next, chop some lard very small & some linen also very
finely, mix all together & use it as wadding, and by a little force
& very precisely, force it into the arquebus or pistol. And
before firing, <-cha-> if possible, make it so that
the ball is hot.
