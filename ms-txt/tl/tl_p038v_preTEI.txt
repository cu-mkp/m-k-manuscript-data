Merchant

Those who sell velvet &amp; es other
stuffs by retail do not make double-entry books because selling by
retail &amp; in detail it would be too much effort for them. They have
only their sales book &amp; their account book. But those who sell in
bulk &amp; those who traffic in pastel woad have
double-entry books.







Scarlets

Because one aulne costs seven or eight
lb to dye, they use cloths worth seven or eight
francs an aulne. But whoever wants something
beautiful se la should buy white cloth worth
fifteen francs an aulne &amp; have it dyed with
pure scarlet pastel woad &amp; a little cochineal.
Black cloth is thin so that the dyeing is
inexpensive.
