Black color for dyeing

Take lye of quicklime & litharge, mix & soak,
& you will make a tawny dye, & by reiterating it
you will make black. Try other colors with lye of lime.







Against nosebleed and for dyeing

Pestle some sorrel or lapathum
acutum of the sort that is red-veined, which is called
dragonâ€™s blood, and apply it <-of the-> to
the forehead of the one who bleeds. This herb is a strong
dye & makes beautiful violet.







Beautiful artichokes

One needs to prune them every year so that only
one stalk is left, & water them thoroughly. <-L->
Also replant some every year, for the second
year they will bear very beautiful fruit.







Planting trees

One says that rarely a tree planted on St. Paul's
day fails to take, & for covering the bark, cow dung
is very appropriate, for it is not undone in the rain like earth.







Merchant

Those who sell velvet & <-es-> other
stuffs by retail do not make double-entry books because selling by
retail & in detail it would be too much effort for them. They have
only their sales book & their account book. But those who sell in
bulk & those who traffic in pastel woad have
double-entry books.







Scarlets

Because one aulne costs seven or eight
lb to dye, they use cloths worth seven or eight
francs an aulne. But whoever wants something
beautiful <-se la-> should buy white cloth worth
fifteen francs an aulne & have it dyed with
pure scarlet pastel woad & a little cochineal.
Black cloth is thin so that the dyeing is
inexpensive.
