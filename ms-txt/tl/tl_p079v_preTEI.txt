and put it into an earthen pot, &amp; it should have
many hot ashes underneath, &amp; little by little you will make
the fire underneath bigger and bigger, &amp; one ought not to move it,
&amp; when it is cooked, &amp; it needs to be for six
hours, mind that the fumes do not harm you
for they are bad.





For making varnish

Take some mastic, sang daRage
darac, gum arabic
&amp; spike lavender oil, as much of one as the other,
&amp; make them melt all together, &amp; before coating it, lay a coat
of glue quite clear, &amp; let it dry.





Antidote against the fumes of metals

In the morning, take a piece of toast with butter,
&amp; neither antimony nor any other vapor will be able to
harm you. Or put half a pig’s bladder in front
of the face.





Tin for casting

They use common tin, which is the one that
pewterers use to make plate, which is composed of 9 or
ten ten lb of fine lead for one
quintal of tin.

Some find that there is nothing better
than fine tin.





Mixture for printers

Make a layer of pulverized antimony, &amp; a layer
of latten &amp; old scrapings or thin plates of iron or
clo iron nail heads, and continue in this way
until the crucible is full. And melt inside a four à
vent, &amp; then mix a little tin &amp; fill up the
crucible with lead until it causes it. And
increase the fire &amp; mix to make the substances alloy well. The
mixture for large letters is harder.
