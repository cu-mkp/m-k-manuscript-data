and put it into an earthen pot, & it should have
many hot ashes underneath, & little by little you will make
the fire underneath bigger and bigger, & one ought not to move it,
& when it is cooked, & it needs to be for six
hours, mind that the fumes do not harm you
for they are bad.





For making varnish

Take some mastic, sang <-daRage->
darac, gum arabic
& spike lavender oil, as much of one as the other,
& make them melt all together, & before coating it, lay a coat
of glue quite clear, & let it dry.





Antidote against the fumes of metals

In the morning, take a piece of toast with butter,
& neither antimony nor any other vapor will be able to
harm you. Or put half a pig’s bladder in front
of the face.





Tin for casting

They use common tin, which is the one that
pewterers use to make plate, which is composed of 9 or
<-ten-> ten lb of fine lead for one
quintal of tin.

Some find that there is nothing better
than fine tin.





Mixture for printers

Make a layer of pulverized antimony, & a layer
of latten & old scrapings or thin plates of iron or
<-clo-> iron nail heads, and continue in this way
until the crucible is full. And melt inside a four à
vent, & then mix a little tin & fill up the
crucible with lead <-until it causes it->. And
increase the fire & mix to make the substances alloy well. The
mixture for large letters is harder.
