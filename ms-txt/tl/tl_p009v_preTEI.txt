They completely melt orpiment in a glass
bottle on very hot ashes, but it would be more appropriate to
sublimate orpiment in a long-necked matrass as for
making garnets. The orpiment thus turns red like red
enamel & one needs to first grind it moist because once completely
melted it is very lively & difficult to grind. Next, one can
<-br-> thin it, once dry, with oil & it will
make a deep yellow of heightened color. But to prevent orpiment
from dying with the other colors & to render it compatible with
these & to make it dry promptly, it is a secret held to be very rare to
calcine common salt & to grind it in. 
Vert de terre is not used with oil.
