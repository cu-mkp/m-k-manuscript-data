powder. When the sausage is full, dip it well in
lightly, to wet the canvas &amp; not the powder, in two
parts of vinegar &amp; of one of
eau-de-vie. Next, let the said canvas dry well, and then
one needs to join to the said sausage a long string or
cord which should be two times longer than the
sausage, &amp; one ought not to tighten it to the sausage but only
to bind it to it at both ends &amp; to sew it on the sausage in a few
places in the middle. Next one needs to anoint the entire sausage with
very good turpentine, and at whichever end of it you wish to join
 to the touch-hole of the petard for giving fire, you can sew
a or tightly attach a large strip of canvas one
empan wide which should also be well soaked in
turpentine; &amp; this strip must be split in the middle in order
to wrap &amp; tie it around the petard, and one needs to attach it in
such a way that the touch-hole should be close to u
mthe the tip of the sausage, which should be open,
should be joined to the touch-hole of the petard. Then one needs to put
a lot of tightly-pressed powder onto the touch-hole of the
petard. And next, the one outside the ditch needs to pull the
thread &amp; cord that is joined to the sausage until
it is moderately extended, but not so much that it is detachedsen. And if
there was water in the ditch, one would need to support the
sausage with forks. Then, the one who holds the end of the sausage will
be able to give fire, having gotten himself to safety, &amp; the others
also.




 On petards
Petards that one wants to place on doors or iron grates are
sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 lb. Moreover, as for its
charge, ball, &amp; fashion of proceeding, one needs to do all as is
already said above, concerning the one of 3 quintals. One man
can carry it.

The ball needs to be be round on one side &amp; flat on the other
like a half ball a half of a cut ball. It is also
necessary that the cross is held to the ball and that it, when the ball
is founded if you make it from metal, is bound up with the middle
of the cross.
