Latten

It is very capricious to cast. It must be cast very hot. And to better
achieve your goal, throw on it some sal ammoniac to thin it. Alloy
it as well with a little red copper and, when you want to cast, a
little tin to make it run better. It always leaves a tail like
melted glass. It does not require as long a gate as
others.





Molding

It is only good that it die down a little on the outside &amp;
nevertheless be red on the inside, for when it comes out of the fire,
the air &amp; vehement exhalations of fire do not receive the cast so
well.





Casting of silver

Silver needs a longish gate. For gold it does not
matter. Silver, when soldering, tolerates the water
one throws on it. But gold would spatter, &amp; needs
that for that reason, one casts solder
bran on the solder.



Let the mold cool well after the casting before opening
it.





Reinforcing flowers and delicate things

For flowers &amp; delicate things
&amp; herbage, one does not use wheat oil but melted
butter, of which one gives a light # coat
 on the back of the petals of the
rose flower &amp; the pansy &amp; other flowers that
need it. But one reinforces the little legs of flies &amp;
other small animals with wheat oil to strengthen them
&amp; make them hold up.

Strawberries

The leaves are cast separately &amp; then are joined with
solder. And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid,
&amp; by that means is heavy, and the tin stem which is delicate
will not be able to hold it up without soon breaking, one makes the
stems with latten wire &amp; then one solders &amp; joins
them.
