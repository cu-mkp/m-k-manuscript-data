A drink having a taste of wine

Take tartar from large vessels & soak it in
water & it will have the taste of wine.





Founding

Some, to make it run neatly, put half metal &
half copper. Others take one part of
potin & one part of <-copper->
latten. Others take one part of candlestick
latten & one part of basin latten. And among
basins, the latten of larger ones is brittler than that of
skillets, because for making the curve of the round so small it is
necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, to which they give a more
ample curve of the round, a brittler substance can be taken. In any event,
the brittlest latten runs better & casts more neatly, but
let it be cast very <-neat-> hot. <-One-> When one wants
to cast, one casts lead into the substance, which makes it flow
& run & goes up in smoke, & keeps the mold from
corrupting. And if you want to cast fire pieces, mix in more
rosette than latten, in order that it be less breakable. The
crucibles for melting metal should be better than
those for glassmakers, as glass is not as
heavy as metal. And in this instance, one needs to lute the
crucibles with earth and pestled glass.




Crucibles

Those that are made in winter & humid
weather are not good. Those of the founders must be thick
and must be luted.




Casting

Finely calcined pumice stone casts 22 carat
gold without repair, but it needs to be ablaze and red like the
metal. And it withstands several casts.
