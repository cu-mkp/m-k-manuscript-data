a sign that it has some humidity, & if the flower also had some
aquosity, it would rot. It also ought not to be <-too-> coarse,
for with its heaviness it would weigh down the flower & make it lose
its form. Having thus chosen it as is needed, take a box, in
which you first make a mound of the said sand, on which you will set the
stalk of your flower, <-in such a way-> laid down so that the flower
touches neither the bottom nor the sides of the box, but
remains in the air. Then, weigh down the stalk with more <-on->
sand in order that it remains firm & fixed. Finally, take some of the
same sand & with two fingers pulverize & cast
it delicately on the flower, <-e-> imitating in that the flow of
an hourglass. And when the flower is as if
<-half-> covered, strike your fist on the table
where the box is set in order that the sand drops & enters
everywhere. Finally, cover it all over and thus lay in other flowers,
in order, one over the other, as many as your box can contain.
That being thus arranged, expose it for several
days to hot sun. And while the flower dries, the
sand, which ever accompanies it & holds it, does not allow that in
contracting, it shrivels & closes in on itself, but it must dry in the same state as when you put it there. Now
take heed that you choose for that effect cornflowers,
marigolds, the yellow meadow flowers called
ranunculus or pa[<-l->]ta
lupina, amaranth & suchlike, and broom,
and others that your experience will teach you.



The sand with which goldsmiths buff enamels or the
white one that glassmakers use, & any lean sand that does
not hold together, pass it through a horsehair sieve, for
it ought not to be so thin. Next, dry it well in the sun for
several days to remove all humidity from it, and
ventilate it like grain so that the dust goes away. Once it is
rid of that dust & well dried, use it as you know.



Pansies are kept thus.






For keeping fruits all year

One needs to pick them in serain &
<-s-> quite dry weather & by the stem without
touching <-it-> the fruit with your hand, and
put them in glass bottles that have a wide
opening, like tall glass boxes for putting preserves.
Fortify them with straw or something else so that they may not
break, and seal them well with wax so that they may not breathe.
And if they had a glass lid, well-sealed with wax, they
would be all the better. Put them in a case in your
well, or in your cellar in a vat, or in a
cos of earth full of water.



For where the hand will touch, it will rot,
and it is even good not to breathe on them. You can also put in
leaves from vine.
