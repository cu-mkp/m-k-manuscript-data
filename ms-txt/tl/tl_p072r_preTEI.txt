Printerâ€™s letters

Those who make them, mix into the lead some
<-nails-> nailheads & old
horseshoes, & antimony which makes it all melt.
This composition is strong for printing, & holds up. It runs
and is good for casting in lead.







Casting in copper 

It is necessary that the frame be quite even & that
it fits well also on the board where it is set, so that it holds
firm & does not shift when one molds. It is necessary that the sand
be clean & well chosen and well reheated, & pulverized very
finely on marble, for the one that you want to put
first on the medal, and that you press strongly when molding. Guard against
oiling your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly
and reheat well, & let cool. Moisten your sand with wine boiled
with elm root, and cast latten which comes out well /
namely from the substance of the trebuschets and similar
thin things. Make your gate broad & even if it is barely thick, it
will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the mold. Cast
from the foot of the medal, in order that the face, further away from the
heat, comes out better & more relieved from the violent heat. And if
your frame does not have vents, make some
<-qu-> in the sand, which come from the edges 
of the piece, to go into the gate. Cast very hot, which you
will recognize when you throw a little reserved substance in that
which is already well melted, & if it melts quickly, this is a sign
it is <-fo-> quite hot. At that time, invigorate the heat
of your furnace with bellows of the right size,
keeping the mouth of the furnace well covered with some large
<-cuivr-> tile or other similar thing,
which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take
your red-hot pincers & the crooked
iron as well, to clean the charcoals which are in
your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a latten
wirebrush. The grindings from sharpening large scissors &
large knives is very good for copper.





One believes it to be a great secret to put in
persicaire, which renders them soft as lead. Try
to extract salts from it.
