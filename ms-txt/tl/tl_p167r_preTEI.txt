Petards




Petards are made of the best alloy of metal & fine
rosette that one can, in order that they do not burst,
namely one part of metal & two of fine
rosette or old cauldron, which is even better. Some
are of fifteen or seventeen lb & <-ch-> are
loaded with two & a half lb of good grain
powder, & they are for applying on windows & common doors.
Others are of the weight of 25 to 27 lb and are loaded with 4
lb of powder. Others weigh 45 lb & are
loaded with eight lb of powder. And thus they are formed
according to the effort they have to make. On the outside, they are <-e->
of a regular shape, but on the inside, they are made like a
crucible, 





 narrower on the inside of the breech & becoming wider
toward the mouth. And this is to give force to the breech, because of
the quantity of powder they hold, & so that they do not
burst. <-At the breech one gives them-> Those of 45 lb
have a thickness of eight lines at the breech & become
thinner on the inside toward the muzzle, which is of 4 lines.
They are xii thumbs breadth long & seven in diameter at
the muzzle & opening.
