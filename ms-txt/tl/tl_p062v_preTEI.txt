Drawing

To become an artist, one needs to draw by
eye, without compass or ruler.
Masters do not allow apprentices to do this.

When the imprimatura has been long done, it becomes greasy.
One needs to rub it with ash & water.






Perspective

To know the point, one needs to lay down a ruler over the
lines, & at the intersection of these, the point will
be. Some make a hole at the end of their
rulers to fix the point by that hole & move the
ruler about. Others lay down a ruler across the panel,
then on this laid-down ruler they set the tip of another
ruler, which, attached to the former by means of a screw,
moves about & reaches as far as necessary without losing the point.
    
The ruler and compass without the judgment of the
eye cause errors.
Perspective is very difficult.






To paint perspective in oil, you ought not to use a
ruler, for you would smudge everything. But when layering your
colors you need to keep to <-the-> & follow the lines of your
first drawing.



To make plumb lines also, which go from the top
<-to make-> <-vif-> to the bottom of the panel,
you need to have a thread with some piece of lead
attached to one end & a little hook to the other for
hanging the said thread from the top of the panel.

    
    








Panel

To draw & to layer the colors, especially in oil, it is necessary that you
hold your panel as upright as you can on the easel, for if
it is slanted there is a danger that some dust & dirt might stick on
it. Keep clean & without dust the place where you paint.
