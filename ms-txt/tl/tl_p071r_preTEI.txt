Amber

It softens like paste when boiled in melted wax, and
takes color boiled with <-ceru-> fat of a young goat kid, for that of
a goat buck would make it break, principally if it is glazed.







Wood with streaked grain

The elm, in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks
diversified with grey and black, and the root of the
maple, but one needs to choose well the grain of the
wood. One gives the maple a certain yellow color,
then one varnishes it.







Mulled and sugared wine



The English, when they feel a cold coming on, mull wine in this
manner. They heat it in a <-large-> tin pot until
it boils, and when it is boiling up, they <-remove it from->
light it with burning paper to know if it is hot
enough. Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one
vessel into another, as one who wants to beat eau
pan√©e, and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a
burning paper what is falling from one vessel into the
other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the
wine is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few
cloves & a sufficient quantity of sugar. And
they <-boi-> drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.





The common English put sugar in wine to affect
for themselves the sweet new wine, which they cannot have because,
owing to the long sea crossing, the wine has lost its
sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.







Weary horses

For fortifying a harried horse, they make it drink some of
the aforesaid wine through a horn, and it finds itself
disposed for doing an even greater labor.





Eau-de-vie

The Irish do not drink any wine because they convert
it into eau-de-vie, which they use almost as habitually as we use
wine.
