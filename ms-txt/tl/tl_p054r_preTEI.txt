on some of the high shelves, & at that time, one knows
when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they
<-hau-> lengthen & raise the head & a part of
the body. At that time one carries them to the heath branches
where they stop & begin to spin their prison, which one calls
cocoon, commonly the size of a pigeon egg, although
one finds much larger ones because it sometimes happens that two or
three & up to xi worms are put in a cocoon, which is hairy
& downy all around, <-&-> the hair of which is
ferret-silk or floret; & from the
cocoon, which is a white, solid, continuous & firm skin, silk
is made. The cocoon is so hard that one only cuts it with difficulty
with a fingernail. And nevertheless, to leave its
prison, <-it-> the worm gnaws it at one end,
& after having stayed inside living on its own sap
<-it-> for three weeks, it comes
out, diminished by half. For when it begins to spin, it is
as long as a ring finger & has eight feet, &
coming out it is shorter by half & only has 4 feet. On the
other hand, it has become a butterfly & has wings, without, however,
flying. And there are male & female. As soon as they come
out of the cocoon, the male charges the female & one puts them on a
white linen, where they make their eggs, which the female would not
make well & profitably if the male was not given to her. And when the
male has detached himself from a female, one needs to throw it out, for it
would not be good to give it to another. They have completed spinning
& making their eggs in three weeks &
around St. Johnâ€™s Day. And at that time one keeps
their eggs & seed until Holy Week, as
<-on-> is said. Some spin among the leaves & make
their cocoon there without climbing high.
