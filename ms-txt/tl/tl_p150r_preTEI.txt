Very strong wax

Mix with this rosin and bole, and do not cast it very
hot.





Various alloys of tin and lead

For hollow things like turtles, half fine
lead and half tin.

For flowers, almost all tin, namely a lb of fine
tin and two ℥ of fine lead.

For lizards that are as thick as one or two
fingers, almost all lead, namely a lb
of fine lead and 4 ℥
<-es-> of fine tin.







Molds

They are less subject to cracking while reheating when they are very
thick, rather than when they are of little thickness, provided that
the thickness is sufficient. For being thin, they scarcely need to be
<-recui-> on the fire, & a long time on the fire
makes them corrupt, especially when the plaster is not
strong.

It is better to reheat a mold on its own than several
together, because one needs a larger & more violent fire for several
than for one. And, glowing charcoal stopping up the space between
the molds, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such
a way that more often you will find your molds burst &
cracked on one side more than another.

Therefore reheat your molds alone, not making fire there,
except to cover it.

And because your lead and tin become sour when
frequently melted red, to soften, melt it without reddening, and
cast in a rod.

Brick cools the metal, & if this were not for giving
bond, it would not be necessary.



The reheated molds cannot withstand several casts. But those in
which one wants to cast only lead or tin
[<-and->] or flat medals, having been only
dried, withstand many.



Very finely ground iron scales render them very firm &
strong.
