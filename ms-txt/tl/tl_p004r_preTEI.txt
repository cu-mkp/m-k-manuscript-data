Varnish of spike lavender oil

One needs to heat spike lavender oil & as it begins to
simmer, put in powdered sandarac gum so that it soon melts. And
over a charcoal fire stir continuously until the sandarac
is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
varnish on a plate, and if it is fatty when you handle
it with a finger, it is ready. And for one lb
of spike lavender oil, you will put five ounces of
pulverized sandarac, although some only put in four
ounces, but this is neither so good nor so fatty. This one is
promptly dry. Frame makers, to avoid the trouble of polishing
their ebony, varnish it with this, as do guitar makers.
This is not as appropriate for panels as that of fine turpentine,
though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not use to
varnish the landscape of a panel when linseed varnish was in use,
because it yellowed the landscape. But with that of
turpentine, one varnishes everywhere. You can put in
pulverized mastic extracted in tears or otherwise, & it will be
more desiccative, in place of sandarac.

If you want to varnish on plaster or a wall, first put on
your very hot hide glue, because if were cold it
would not penetrate the wall, & when you would put your
varnish on, it would come off.





Varnish of spike lavender oil is not as appropriate for colors as
that of turpentine, for spike lavender oil <-makes them
die-> eats the colors since it is too
penetrating.







For removing varnish from an old panel that is yellowish &
varnishing it anew

Take white soap & sieved ashes<-e->, &
soak both in water. And with a sponge, take the said
ashes & soap & rub the panel with them. And as you
see that the old varnish is removed, throw a
bucket of water against the panel to clean it.
Next put it for a quarter of an hour in the
sun to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel
is dry, you can spread your turpentine varnish on it.





Make sure the colors do not come off.
