For telling someone that you will <-show-> teach him something
he does not know, and neither do you

Take a string or a small stick and take the
measurement from the tip of his ear to the tip of his
nose and show it to him. Thus you will teach him something
you did not know, and neither did he.







For supporting a bucket of water on the tips of three
knives laid down without touching the ground









According to the strength of your knives, either
kitchen or table, you will make them support a large
weight on their tips laid down & arranged in a triangle, edge to
edge, as you can see, & they would not touch the ground. And if,
after arranging them this way, you turn them the other way without
unjoining them, the tips of the handles can also support a large weight
without touching the ground. You can easily adapt this to another
use with pikes, with joists, or to promptly make a tripod in a
camp with three halberd points. If the edge of the
knife marked A faces from right to left, the butts of the
handles will rise, but if the edge of the same knife faces from
left to right, the tips will rise.







For boiling an egg in cold water without fire

Empty an egg from both ends so that nothing remains inside,
then fill it with quicklime & natural sulfur, then
stop the holes with wax & put it in water so that it
floats by two or three fingers.







For making rabbits come out of a burrow

Take some embers in a pot, & having put
sulfur on top, put it in the burrows & block it
with something light.
