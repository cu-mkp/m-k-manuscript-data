  Vipers and snakes  I molded a viper, which, for casting, is more appropriate than any other snake because it has scales beautiful &amp; very visible on all the body &amp; principally on the head and under the throat. It has a flat head, the snout reddish, tending toward incarnadine, &amp; snubbed like the horned asp or like un the top of a pig's snout, big jowls, the eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open, where it has double canine teeth on each side, all coming out of a strip of flesh that covers and clothes them. It also has, in the throat, a tube of flesh, made like a dog’s penis, from which comes its stinger. Other snakes have a double row of teeth.  If you want cut the to mold the snakes with the mouth open, you must cut off the head &amp; leave it inside, for it will not be released.   Molding turtles  It is a matter different from the casting of snakes, &amp; plants, and flowers because the cavities that are between the two shells require several pieces. They are molded in plaster to be cast in sugar without making a gate as do all things that you want.   Plaster for casting of wax  When you want to cast in wax in the plaster mold, you must know as secret that there is need for your mold to be in hot water. Never does the animal come out so neatly than in metal, because the wax sticks. But it is to model an animal as close to nature, et to repair it afterward. One needs to smooth well away all the scales, when for wax would enter there &amp; not release well. In molding thus the animal, flatten down the scales for wax &amp;, on the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they stand up for animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not wait for the wax to a bit cool completely to release it, but do so when it is still a bit warm. When you have also molded the first cast of the animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its release, there is as much of it in one half of the mold as in the other. Make also strong wide gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified when it is released, &amp; afterward you cut this off.  + Alabaster, commonly called so, which is nevertheless plaster, is very hard but it shrinks a lot. It is very good to make medals, but it wants to be very finely sieved.
