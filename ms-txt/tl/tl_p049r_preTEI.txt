Casting of lead

Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of
churches, <-in it-> melt <-one-> for one
lb of tin a half of lead, &
cast in stone, & if they want their work whiter, they put
<-p-> half tin and half lead, but
the first mixture is the best, & does not become porous. One needs
to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke
their molds with a resin candle to cast neatly. The
antimony makes the substance brittle & breakable. The
looking-glass tin makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as
for tin, it works well <-to the-> with pure lead.
Those who make very neat lead casts, use puncheon.
Pewterers cast in a copper mold. One says
that one makes lead take hold on glass with
resin. Some put into the lead a quarter of
tin. Looking-glass tin  renders the work stronger.



Poncet

They cast with solder that <-pewterers->
glassworkers use. 



Lump of iron

Calcined <-iron-> oyster shell




    
    


Sand for lead casting

Rye straw ashes well boiled then dried & then
well sieved. Bind it with glair of egg. One can cast
copper, latten, and others in it.


    
    


Another

Burnt & calcined pumice stone. Burnt & calcined
cuttlefish bones, as much of one as of the other;
& ashes of walnut tree or vine, well
boiled, dried & finely sieved,
bound with glair of egg.



    


Pewterers

They put into one quintal of fine tin one
lb of looking-glass tin, which renders the tin
thicker. There are two kinds of tin, one of them nearly like
lead, which runs better, the other brittle, which becomes
thicker. They cast in solid & thick tin molds or, to
do it more neatly, in copper molds engraved with a
burin, or in stone, or in earth. Since
latten scraps, mixed in, only render the tin more
breakable & harder & difficult to work with, they cast
in their very hot molds <-& almost roug-> &
with very hot tin. They fumigate their tin molds with
resin candles.

Brittle <-dou-> tin is found mixed into
saulmons, easy to cut, but difficult to put to use & melt
if it is not mixed with the other soft one. And without this,
it would become waste.
