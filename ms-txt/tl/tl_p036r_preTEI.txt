For transmuting a ball into a thimble,
cunning

    







of leather



Make a small sheath of plain leather, such as cow or
morocco, somewhat thick, as tall as three
fingers, sewn like the finger of a glove &amp; large
enough that two fingertips can fit inside &amp; which, at
the tip, which is a little puckered, has a round hole as large as a
double liard. Take one two similar
boxwood balls, &amp; let one be hollow &amp;
open with a round hole on one side only so that the thimble can
fit inside. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your
leather sheath on the table with the
ball that is not hollow. Pass a stick inside the
leather sheath to show that there is nothing there, also
show the full ball, and hold the one which is hollow &amp; has
the thimble inside it by your little finger &amp; ring
finger, and do this with your right hand
with which you are holding the stick. Next, you take your
leather sheath &amp; place it over the hollow
ball which is in your fingers, &amp; making it seem as
if you are putting some oribus powder over it, you put
back the leather mold that
contains the ball with the thimble on the
table, then you take the round &amp; solid ball
remaining on the table, and command it to enter from under the
table into the leather sheath. Then, when lifting
the leather, the ball seems to be the same,
although it is the hollow one. Then you cover it again &amp; command it to
become invisible. And then, lifting the sheath while pressing
it, you will remove it &amp; the ball along with it; &amp;
l putting it aside with the sheath,
&amp; a  in its place will be found a thimble
for the ladies whose bottom hurts, that is to say, the bottom of the
needle.
