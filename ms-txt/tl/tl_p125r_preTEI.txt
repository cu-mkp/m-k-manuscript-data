üùã From small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of
crusting & removing
anything from the mold, because the
wax, being taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make
your vents
    

coming from the head, which is in the bottom, toward the
gate. Make also your gate so that it is <-too-> but a
little thick, and make within its course two or three notches, for
this breaks up the fury of the metal

& from these conduits & feeders, you can also
put in small threads of wax which are joined to the body, in
order that the metal goes more easily from one part to another
& promptly runs everywhere. And from these conduits, you lead your
gate & your vents without spoiling anything.

and makes it flow with ease,
without bubbling nor making excessive fumes, which hinders its run.
You can divide it also in two or three branches thus
        


        
when it approaches the molded thing, and always make holes in the
gate.
    





Plaster

When you <-v-> mold something to cast wax in it, you
mold in plaster alone, reheated after being pulverized.
For, once reheated in stone, the outside is cooked & the
inside stays almost raw. Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but the one
that, being tempered, is white & sets very
quickly, is good. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm & hard
after having set, but its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the
nature of each. <-If you-> You will never mold very neatly if
[<-not->] you do not temper, very thin &
liquid, your plaster or your sand of noyau. Temper it
<-immediately-> quickly after it has been reheated.




+
If you mold with plaster <-crud-> alone, reheat it
nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first
mold. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready,
soak it for a long time in water. And if it does not want to
release, soak it in hot water, for cold water hardens it.



    
    


Scimitars

To know

The workers from Damascus or from
Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate, in the
ore, iron from steel. And, from this
first steel, first melted from its ore, they
cast scimitar blades in sand <-sab-> which afterward cut the other iron without any difficulty,
because any melted iron is harder than soft iron
beaten from pigs & bars. Thus is the steel of scimitars, but
it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts <-b-> a scimitar,
one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in
sand.





And hot water softens it further. Cold water does not
penetrate it like it does with the mixed one, because it is harder &
the mixed one is more spongy. 

   
   

        
Hearing from afar
        
Make a small hole in the earth, & place your ear fully
there, at night or at a silent time, & you will easily
hear the noise.
        



        
With this plaster,
thus reheated as powder,
one can cast medals of it
that do not fear the
rain, especially if they are
varnished. One can find these in
Germany,

on the houses. But take heed that the water be
very hot, & if it is boiling, there is no danger. All
plaster molds, alone or mixed, release in it.
