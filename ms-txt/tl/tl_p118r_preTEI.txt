Snails

Those which are found in the sea & similarly those in
which certain small crabs dwell are very beautiful for
grottos, if they are stripped of the first crust of their
shell with aquafortis, for they truly appear to be made of
mother of pearl.





For removing flashing and barbs from things molded à noyau

If your molds are of good plaster which withstands
well the fire, <-&-> they will not crack at all, especially
if, with presses, they are squeezed well between two
boards or in a vessel filled with ashes or
sand, & in this way they will make no flashing. But if they do
make some, you can remove it with a burin that one calls
chaple, which has a tip like a small
chisel.





For grottos



The old vine stocks

Stones made from water called stuf,
charcoal, the compound of tin & fine latten, paper
pestled & mixed with pestled glass, cork,
heated parchment, white coral are appropriate for making grottos. But fantastical pieces of wood which are
found in the forests, & mushrooms, and
potirons of trees, once dry, are better than
any other because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
looking-glass tin, which has a shiny luster. One finely pestles diverse sorts of marcasites which one washes to cleanse them of
earth, & one sprinkles the work with it, which is very
beautiful. If there is no fountain in the grotto, one
glues all <-al-> of this with strong glue, 
<-which-> and it is soon done. Take
specimens of all kinds of minerals. The sulfurous marcasites,
which do not have a grain but are uniform like looking-glass tin,
are very beautiful.



Rosette is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
lumps which are pulverized under the hammer, which are very
beautiful pulverized on grottos.





Looking-glass tin

It whitens & renders firm fine tin if <-in one->
one puts in <-among-> one ounce of it, that
is to say, i ℥ of looking-glass tin in
one lb of fine tin.





Sal ammoniac

<-It-> Sal ammoniac water is very natural for casting
in gold & in silver.
