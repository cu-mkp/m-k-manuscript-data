some threads, as much to secure the plants, in order that they do not
rise par when you throw in your clear sand, as to
give them venting when the mold is reheated. For, in doing this,
the mold thread burns &amp; leaves some
empty space around the plants, which serves as vents &amp; places for
evacuating, &amp; to give air to the plants so that they burn better.
For what makes them stay as charcoal is that they burn in a
closed fire &amp; without empty space because of their fine sprigs. Try,
therefore, to thicken the main stem with a little melted wax,
&amp; let it cool, then mold it. And when the wax melts, it airs
it, the principal stem, with space &amp; as if loose so that it burns
better. Or else, anoint them with oil of petrol or
sulfur, of turpentine, oil of
brick &amp; similar things, or aquafortis or
eau-de-vie, or make sands with crocum, iron
scales, loops of iron, emery &amp; things that
withstand several days of great firing.

Animal bones are not so difficult to burn &amp; reduce to
ashes, because once the flesh is burnt, the bones
remain loose &amp; the weight of the quicksilver makes them break
&amp; disintegrate, once calcined &amp; burnt.



Asparagus always stays as charcoal, like little pins.
Try to take it, and thyme, at the beginning, when they are
growing, so that their stem is still thin.




Molds of plaster for wax

When your mold of plaster is done &amp; dried, take
heed that your mold be of good release, for sometimes it
happens that the animal, being wounded or thin &amp; withered, makes
wrinkles, where retire its scales are, where the plaster enters. And this not being of good release,
the wax animal would attaches itself &amp; break &amp; you would never
have it perfect. Take heed also to make your gates for the
wax very wide. Thus, &amp; the gates should not be too thick.
They are made when the animal is

 the molds have been made from both sides &amp; the animal is
outside of it.
