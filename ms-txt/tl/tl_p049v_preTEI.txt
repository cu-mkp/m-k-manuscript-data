Calandra larks & all
birds taken from the nest & which have not had freedom are
better, for these which are taken by net never sing so well. However,
the wild ones give <-[illegible]-> much pleasure with their
chanting, but they ought be taken before St. Michael,
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call gaillardise,
which makes them sick & sometimes makes them die, especially
calandra larks. One knows this when they are sad & do not sing.
One must pierce it <-av->, not with a pin, but
very gently by turning with the tip of quite pointy feather.
The calandra lark does not want to be without <-grey->
river sand, & the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself in it
& purges itself with it.
            

        

 
 
      
        
Grain of lead
        
Take a <-pierced-> playing card, pierced with a
pin or needle, folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small cleft stick and, holding the said
stick by <-one end-> the other end,
put your card three or 4 fingers away from
the water that you will have put in a dish or similar
vessel. Then pour your lead, which should not be too
hot, into the card & continually tap on the stick
that holds it. And thus your lead will granulate itself roundly.
And pass it through a coarse sieve to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The largeish one will reach 25 to 30 paces.
            

        

    
    

              
Birds
        
Those that <-can-> are taken at St. Michael are
good for keeping, but those that are taken in March die,
because they are starting to fall into love. Ortolans
are fed on oats all summer in order that they are nourished without becoming
fat, to be more appropriate for hunting & catching others.
Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them
millet. They sing at night. One needs to
<-c-> take them after mid-July until
St. Michael, for after that time when they have their young in
this country, they go [<-t->] away like turtledoves do. Siskins
should also be taken from All Saintsâ€™ Day until
Christmas, for after that they go to the mountains to
brood.
            

        

            
Ortolans are ventriloquists, such that singing without
opening the beak, one would say that they are.
