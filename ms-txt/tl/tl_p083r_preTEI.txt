Sand  for lead

℞ grey soot from the furnace of the
silversmiths, quick lime, and
flour ana, moistened according to the art, being the
finest possible.



The grey soot of locksmiths, which is held in the
forge, is very fine once ground, molds very neatly, &
releases very well.




Sand for copper medals

℞ hat felt burnt on a covered
fire, dross of iron, & burnt bone, all of which
ground very finely & pestled & watered with saltwater;
& make a paste of it & mold it, & wipe it over a
straw fire.   These three sands, pulverized and very finely
ground on porphyry, mold well, and I think that
separately each of them is very good. Burnt hat felt molds very
neatly and releases very neatly.



Plaster molds very neatly but it becomes porous. Bone has
scarcely any body unless it has iron dross. Felt makes it
release. 




Another sand

 Charcoal of vine shoots & clay earth,
<-well cooked &-> well
sieved, as much of one as the other, & join them together
with well beaten glair of eggs, then calcine in the
furnace, & to use it, temper it with vinegar.





Another for lead

℞ finely pestled slate &
<-calcined-> pumice stone, mixed together. Calcine them in
a well covered pot, & thrice stoppered over a good fire,
& each time temper them with varnish.




Another

℞ <-p-> a  little-cooked tile,
ground & tempered in white wine with burnt black
tracing paper, & if you add burnt horse
dung, it will be all the better. Moisten with glair of egg.



Tracing paper burnt over a closed fire is reduced just as
charcoal & very soft black, molds neatly & makes it
release well mixed with the others.





Excellent sand

Alabaster calcined in a crucible over
charcoal fire, so that, touching it, it turns into powder. Once
cold, pulverize it finely & pass it through a double sieve
& render it as if impalpable. And <-d-> with one
lb of alabaster, one needs one
℥ of sal ammoniac. Mix well &
incorporate everything together, then put them in a
<-cellar-> cellar or a humid
place. And with this paste, mold what you will need, & next
dry the mold in the fire, & cast whichever metal you wish, while
the sand is hot; & you will cast as neatly as the principal, &
the sand can still be used by placing it in a humid place
& drying it in the fire.
