Having therefore let your crayfish dry a little in the
sun or on its own, if it has eggs, they will shrink while drying
and will only be more beautiful. Therefore, make your slab of
yellow potterâ€™s earth, like for other figures,
lay your crayfish on top, the <-s-> back
<-on top-> on the bottom, & the legs, belly &
eggs, which are all the most fanciful parts to mold, on the other side
and on the top. Push the back down in the clay slab,
up to near the legs, which is about halfway. And fix the body with an
iron wire point in the middle &, if it seems
necessary, another at the end of the tail. And in order that the
big legs show themselves lower than the head, which is
<-enf-> half sunken, extend them &, from
underneath, add to them a little clay to raise them. Hide also the
horns in the clay, under the big legs, to arrange them afterward
as you like. As for the small legs, extend them on the clay
until the joint, and the other half of the legs remain above, curved,
for the first cast. However, in order that they do not move &
detach, secure them well, not only on the clay, but
<-att-> fix them with wax & a little hot
iron right in the joints. And if you want to find the
most fanciful cast, you can attach the end of one of the legs with the
same wax on the body, or on one of the big legs, and also make, if
it has eggs, the tail to be half folded on the eggs, & fix it in
this form with an iron wire point. Above all special heed,
since the thing is <-s-> thus arranged, that it can be
well cleaned. Lastly, having rubbed the crayfish with
eau-de-vie, cast your sand. Having set, uncover the back of the
crayfish, the head & the eyes & its little pincers, the
big legs, and the small legs all along, for one needs to uncover the most
that one can, both the long horns & the tail, except if you have
folded & curved it to hold the eggs. Other animals

Secure what will  detach itself,
like the hairy brows near the mouth, with some melted
wax underneath.




Uncover the most that you can, but take
heed that the notching that you make in the mold will release
well.

Make the mold lean on the side
that will be the thickest of the animal.

To paint it, one does the middle of the
back <-mixed-> with vermilion mixed with a little
lake, and the sides & the belly & underneath the legs is
with a flesh color made of vermilion, white of ceruse, a
little yellow ocher. As in this & all other things, have
always the natural one in front of you to imitate it.

Lay the horns on the big legs,
<-&-> or make with whitened latten wire &
solder them.

Take heed <-d-> when
modeling to arrange the legs in such a way that they do not pass the
belly of the crayfish, <-Aultr-> and that,
placing them, they sit well on the belly, otherwise the legs would
break from the weight of the body, which is massive.
