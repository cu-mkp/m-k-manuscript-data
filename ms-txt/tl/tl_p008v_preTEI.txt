Polishing of the balas ruby

It is not polished with tripoli <-but-> like the
others, but with marcasite powder & oil.





Or and argent moulu

You need to calcine your fine gold with
☿ and then cleanse your amalgam well & make the
said mercury fly off. Next grind it on marble
with gum water. As for silver one needs to take it as
is & eat away at it with aquafortis, then take it out with a copper blade
& rinse it thoroughly and next grind it with gum water.







Polishing of stones

There are three wheels for doing this, one of tin, one of
lead & one of fine copper. On the
<-cu-> copper wheel only the diamond,
the ruby, sapphire & oriental jacinth are
commonly cut <-co-> or polished. The
tin wheel is for more tender stones like emerald,
amethyst & others.





M<-[illegible]->ixture of Pewterers

Because among the fine tin they quite often mix a half
of lead, which renders the tin deaf, to correct
this, they mix in latten filings to render it
sonorous.





Perfect amalgam

Take the most delicate grais you can & hollow it in
the middle. Put in an eighth part of ☿,
<-in-> & into this, while adding water, rub & wear down your
☾ or ☼ until the
substance becomes like paste & even harder. Next, if you want, eat
it away with good aquafortis, if it is
☾ or ♀. Then remelt it,
having taken it out as you know. The ☾ will have a
tint and, once melted, will leave some grains of
☼, & the ♀ will be
very beautiful & will have almost no crust.
