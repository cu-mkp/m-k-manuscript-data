Perfumer

They readily put half of amber & half
of musk & very little civet, because amber
always overtakes the principal scent of musk.

To spare the amber, they readily put a little musk in
the white layers, [<-&->] <-for l-> which gives a more
forceful scent. But to remove <-the-> or hide the
blackness of the musk, they put in a bit of wheat
starch from England, which is perfectly white.

<-When the amber->
To perfume with white amber in the Portuguese fashion, take a
huchau of amber, well broken up. And having put in a
small silver bowl a <-silver->
spoonful of flower oil, or lacking that,
ben oil, that is to say, a silver
spoon that one uses at the table, put in your
ambergris & place all on a low fire, and it will melt quickly
if your amber is good, & it will remain there without lumps.
Once all melted, put in the size of a pine nut of
civet, & make it melt, & mix it well together. Next, take
your gloves, well-cleaned & well-dried, & dipping the
tip of your finger very lightly <-on-> on the
edge of the oil, spread it on the glove, little by little
& with patience, & rub the glove between your
hands, & trace the fingers & the stitches, one after
the other. And leave it to dry. Next, trace again as before until the
amber is all laid down.







Eau-de-vie

It is excellent for molding neatly, such that in the place where you
do not put any, the sand will usually attach to the figure. But it needs to
be in three passes. And because it does not take easily on oiled
things, I believe that it would be good to put some amongst the
water in which you temper your sand.
