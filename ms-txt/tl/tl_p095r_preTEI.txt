The furbisher buys his blades by the dozen, which
are not fully drawn by the tang because he does this himself to adjust
them well to the <-l-> pommel & guards.

Spanish ones are deemed better for being of better steel
& iron, but they are not as well-forged as swords from
Vienne in <-pro-> Dauphiné. The
Spanish ones are not as well ground coming from the
forge, because they grind them with the
foot, & this is what
makes them wavy.

Blades from Vienne commonly cost xviii or 19
lb a dozen.

The first thing the furbisher does when he gets his new
blades is to draw out their tang, which he does himself or has done by
locksmiths or farriers, giving him some
liard for his charcoal. Next, they
pass it over a grindstone to make it
cut, then lay it down on the
chameau, and with some pulverized
emery, fine & soft as flour, & mixed with oil
to make it hold, they furbish the sword with the stick used to
remove the traces of the grindstone, and then <-the->
clean the sword <-po->well with the
emery and give it a drop or two of oil, which
they spread with the finger to give it luster. Having
put the oil, they furbish the sword again on the
chameau with the
felin, which is a
thunderstone mounted in the middle of a stick like the
fustée, and this stick is called the baton à
felinder. Next, having passed it on the
felin, they furbish it with chalk &
the oil which is on the sword. Next, they wipe it & go over
it again, & furbish with dry chalk. And at the end, when they
are ready mounted, one gives them the edge with the
gratteau.

Once furbished, one mounts it on the guards which one presents to
know if they are quite suitable. And taking hold of a blade such that
the whole ricasso is held in the hand, one conjectures
that it will be just as heavy once mounted.

One puts the blade in a vise between two pieces of
wood, then with a file, they enlarge the opening of the
guard if it is necessary. Then, to rivet it,
one places on the rivet <-a piece of->
& the pommel a piece of wood, & with a hammer,
one beats on it to align & secure the pommel well. Then, with the
hammer, one finishes the rivet when the pommel is well secured
& does not wobble. The wood is put there so as not to spoil
the pommel. Next, one finishes the rivet with a file or
chisel. And some make <-the b-> the rivet in a
square diamond-shape, but it is not as good
as the round one, for, when faceted, the rivet breaks.
