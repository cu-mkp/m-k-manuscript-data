Colors for green leaves

One usually paints them in oil, because distemper
colors have no hold. For marigold flowers, lightly ground
minium for some, & for others which are more yellowish, a bit of
massicot with it. For green, the verdigris has depth &
is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the
verdigris a little yellow ocher & stil de grain
yellow. If the green is dark, put with it charcoal of peach
tree pits, which makes a <-v-> greenish black, in the
same way that black of ox foot bone looks bluish. And
thus, by judgment & discretion, put the color on the natural
flower or leaf to see whether it comes close. But layer it
transparently, so as not to cover the lines of the work.







Large molds

Because of the great weight of the metal, they want to be put
in a press in order that they do not open.







Candle smoke

It makes it come out neater, & even if it is a little
thick, it does not hold to any place because it has no body. I have thus
fumigated my noyau molds for tin &
lead, and have cast in the cold mold, well dried
beforehand, and it came out very neat. It is true that lead mixed
with half of tin was very hot, because the medal was thick.







Gate

<-Even though-> If the medal is very thick, for
this reason do not give it as thick a gate. It suffices for the gate
to have half of its thickness. But if it is thin,
give it a gate of its thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the gate
where typically the material becomes porous.





Never forget to oil the wax gate when you mold plants
or flowers, otherwise it breaks & cannot be taken out.
