I have cast with it the cleanest I have seen, in very small
figures & thin as paper. I have cast very hot in the
very red mold, and have put in the melted substance of
<-this-> the two <-substances-> compositions,
which make silver run, & have made as if I had wanted to
cast pure silver. This alloy is white in
bullitoire, like any alloys which resemble, however
little, ☾. For casting something delicate, use
this one.







Lute

There is no better than the one <-that has-> which you have
molded, namely pieces from your molds. But one needs to choose
those better reheated.





Crucible

Take heed that it is three fingers from
<-fe-> the mouth of the bellows, & that the
said bellows beats from <-us-> underneath the
bottom of the crucible, otherwise it would cool it.





Casting of latten

I took the one of latten skillets, which are beaten &
forged thinly. <-I-> Once well heated, I cast in it
two or three grains, like peas, of sal
ammoniac. This clarified it like a mirror. Once very white from the
force of being hot, I cast in it some pulverized calamine, raw &
pure. I cast it in its very red mold. It came out very neat
& thin like paper, & hollow on the reverse. But because
it had crusted, I reheated it, that is to say
reddened, let it cool, then put it to the whitening, of one part
raw tartar & of one half common salt. Once
well boiled, I rubbed it with a scratch-brush in clear
water. And because the first time it had not





Do not let it cool when melting. It always makes a tail, like melted
glass, because of the calamine.



Usually, the soft latten of skillets becomes red from casting,
especially when it stays a long time in the fire, <-m->
because the calamine exhales itself. But sour latten of
candlesticks becomes yellow & pin filings.
