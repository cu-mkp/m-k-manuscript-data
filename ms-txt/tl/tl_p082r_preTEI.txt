 Heat of copper

It is hot enough when you see it neat & even on top, without
filth.




Frame

Iron & copper make it porous if the metal
touches it, & the wood warps. Thus, make a mold of
wood, & have frames of bricks made inside this mold of
whatever thickness that you want.




Glair of eggs

Glair of eggs gives strength to sand to make several
casts.




Clockmakers

To divide the teeth of their cogwheels proportionately, they do not
use a compass, for there is none so fine that it can
compass distances as small as those of the small
cogwheels. But they make a platform (as they call it)
of latten <-make-> divided into several circles,
& each circle is divided <-d->into equal distances marked by a
point, and each circle has a certain number of them, for example one 30,
another 36, another 40, &c. Then, on the pierced center of the
platform, they set the small cogwheel there, and on the
center of the cogwheel a flat line or alidade which is moved to the
circle with the number that you want to mark on your cogwheel. Then they
mark a line on the cogwheel with a sharp point, then move the alidade
to the following point, & continue to mark thus. And to mark the
points on the circles of their platform, they divide the
circle into three & then divide this third part into as many
distances as is necessary with regard to the total division of the
circle, & make in this manner their division & distribution
of the teeth as fine as they please.
