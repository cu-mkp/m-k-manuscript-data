Stance of animals

Not only with iron points but with melted
wax, animals are secured on the earthen slab.
Wash them first in clear water, once they have died in the mixture


of vinegar & urine,
& with a sponge
purge their mouth,
eyes,
and the
head of
the slaver
which
comes out,
for
the sand
would never
set well
there and
would become
lumpy.



If you want to make them keep their mouths open, put in a little bit of
spinet string, which will not take up space.







Keeping animals

Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again,
put them back into the mixture of urine, vinegar
& eau-de-vie where you killed the others, and they will keep
for a long time without spoiling. If you have a cut on your hand,
take care that this mixture does not touch it.





Molds

Once molded, do not keep them for a long time, but rather use them
<-u-> as soon as you can, because when kept a long time,
they are subject to corrupting.





When they are reheated, the thing comes out better.







Lute

When reheating, you can use common lute. But when you want to
cast, strip the mold of it & promptly, with a
brush, layer the lute of plaster that has been used for
molds, for it will be dry when it is placed, & cast.
One needs to mainly put this lute on the joints.





Silver

When it quivers once melted, it is a sign that it is quite
hot, & because usually it is leady, it is good to throw in it
some lime mortar, for this attracts & gathers the
lead.





Fly wing

In order that they come out better, put from the gate to the edges
of these some veins of wax. Make sure also that under the belly
there is enough wax, for this is what makes the gate.








Joining some fly wing, or similar

They are joined with fish glue mixed with
eau-de-vie over slow fire, heating also the work. Then, this is
covered with modeling wax, which is grey.
