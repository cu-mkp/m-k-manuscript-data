and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your
fingers and easily pestle in a mortar of metal, 
or better yet, of iron. Next, it
will be easy to grind it, not <-only-> on common
marble that would corrode, but on
porphyry, and it is necessary that it be finely ground
with water so that when putting it on your
fingernail, you find it soft without any asperity, like
the <-p-> colors that the painters grind for oil. This one, once dry, you can
use <-au lie-> instead of sand, in a frame 
without moistening it with anything nor reheating it, if you do
not want to; fumigate the hollow form with sulfur smoke or
<-of p-> with the tip of the flame of a wax candle
that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat & shiny &
polished work, in pure lead & tin. I would
say the same for finely pulverized tripoli that does not want to
be <-not-> reheated or moistened. Burnt linen gives less
trouble than any other, because it needs neither to be reheated nor to be
moistened, & molds and releases very neatly <-&
very->, subtly & <-releases well-> neatly, like the
previous ones do as well, & withstands several fusions. First one ought to burn
it with a flame, then leave it to rest & to be consumed with its
fire until it wears it out, then finely grind it on
marble or on a paper. <-But because a

lot-> And if you reheat it in a crucible, red hot due to
the fire, to render all of it fine & impalpable, I believe it will
be even better. But because a lot of linen is reduced to very
little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
medal that you want to mold & cover it, and fill the frame with pestled slate, which molds also very neatly. But
note that the first cast is always the most beautiful & the neatest.
If you cast opportunely, soft tin that seems to be
burnished in little wheels that pewterers sell, comes out
very neatly & approaching the color of silver, without mixing
in anything. It is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &
so that the molded object should be 4 fingers away
from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well,
<-with such a degree of heat-> so hot that it
promptly burns in a shiver a paper or straw placed
inside. Then remove it from the fire & leave it to
rest a little & cast. Tin mixed
