Olives

They are spoiled if once a month one does not
refresh their salt water, which one ought not to touch
with the hands, for this makes them spoil.





Observation from rustics

That when it freezes on Palm Sunday, it
freezes all the months of the year.

That when the first flowers fall <-the suiv-> &
are lost from the frost, the others are usually lost
also.





Grafts
I
It is necessary that the graft be not from old wood, for it is never
a beautiful tree.

One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, & it
does not have enough strength to bud.

Trees which have coarse marrow, like peach trees & all
their kind & plum trees, do not want grafts in
freezing weather because the cold damages their marrow, which one
also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
graft.

All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree is sapping,
for the humor grows them quickly. Otherwise
<-au-> they dry before the humor of
the sap pushes them.





Sand

The white ash of all woods, which still sticks to the
wood that burns, and which has not fallen into the
<-bo-> hearth, molds very
neatly.





Sand

Well pulverized <-ash-> tallow molds &
releases very neatly. The one from the kitchens, which is fatty
& shiny, from the big kitchens, is better.

Finely pulverized quicklime works. The same for broken-up
flint, which works better in the cavity.
