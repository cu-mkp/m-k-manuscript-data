thus one mixes it & reduces it into
<-p-> small stones, purging it of its
impurities. Then, one puts it to cook neatly in a
<-pot-> earthen vessel in
the fornaise of those who make pots, and one
leaves it there until the pots are cooked. Next, one mixes it
again with sal ammoniac water & one grinds it very well,
and one empties the muddy & clean water into a separate
vessel. Again, one puts the same water on top &
one grinds, & again one puts the muddy water with the other.
And one does thus, until it has passed everything. In this way, one
purges & cleanses it, & one renders it very fine &
handleable. Having taken away the water by tilting it or with a
sponge, one takes the residue and one dries it. Then,
moistening it with the aforesaid water, like one does with
the other <-water-> sand, one uses it in a
frame, where, if it retracts, it is a sign that it
has not reheated enough & that one needs to reheat it further. This
one is appropriate for molding all metals, and especially
gold & silver, and the more it is used, the better it
is. One needs to set aside the one in which you cast lead or
tin, for it would sour the gold you would cast in it.
    

Feather alum should be reheated in a
<-cauldron-> crucible covered
with a tile in a strong <-flame->
fire of charcoals, in order that the impurity which could be there
burns with the feather alum, which does not burn. This is done either in the
goldsmith’s forge, surrounded with
bricks, or in a fourneau à vent with
fusion fire, so that the <-sand remains long enough-> 
crucible for a
quarter of an hour remains red. This is done more to cleanse it
than for anything else. It becomes reddish on the surface & on the
inside it remains white & better dried out. #



#
After your feather alum is cooled,
pestle it in a mortar, then grind it on marble, and it will be rendered into very fine wooly
filaments which give bond to the sand without getting burned as
other things do, which is a beautiful invention. Pestle it in the
mortar by dragging the pestle, for the flying dust
could enter your throat or land on your face, which
will give you reason to scratch yourself well. Put it in the mortar a little
at a time to avoid the flying dust. It is
better

to grind it thus, in the mortar, dragging the
pestle, than on marble,
<-for-> where <-c-> it spreads, & in
the mortar, it collects on all sides. Render it very fine &
soft to the touch.

Clay to make circles around molds should
be very fatty & handleable, and serves only to make the surrounding of
the molds. Thus, one ought only to choose the quite fatty kind, and beat
very well, & moisten it moderately with some water, & keep
it in a pit or in a terrine, and make numerous
holes with a stick in it, which fill with water, in
order to keep it always fresh & soft, so that it is always ready to use
when you need it.
