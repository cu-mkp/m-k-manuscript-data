When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the fumes of
the substance you are melting, because the cast is imprinted with the quality
<-e->of the metal, which afterward runs more easily in something that comes from it.

 Human bones are the best for casting once
calcined.

To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot
& to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some
iron scales, either in powder or otherwise, <-E-> for
it heats copper a lot & cleanses it of its grease. At the
end, when you want to cast, add some saltpeter, by folding your
additions in a paper in order that everyone may not know what you
mix in.

Sheep foot bones are even better than those of oxen
foot.

Oil & tallow make it very porous, &
    pestled glass, & copper alone.

Cendr√©e earth molds very neatly.

Ash does not have enough body to withstand
copper.

It is better not to mix the sands, but to fill the frame with
one only.

Latten is always fatty, & does not mold neatly. One finds
that it comes out better alloyed with a quarter of
copper, but let it be cast very hot.

    Copper comes out well with a bit of metal. If you mix
in metal within latten, it will be more brittle & more
troublesome.

Slightly coarser sand has more body.

Sand from <-corp-> rock is always better,
which seems like tuf in lumps, which has a beautiful
& very fine grain, & a little fatty. One pestles it, then one
dries it in a skillet on the fire, until it <-is-> no longer
smokes, then one passes it through a fine & double sieve,
& one molds with it.



Copper or latten cannot come out well if the medal does
not sufficient thickness, & if it does not have it, give it some
with wax.



Some cast through a hole made in the middle of the reverse side of the
medal.



Some, wanting to cast large works in latten, <-in it->
mix in the sand some pestled glass to give the earth
bond. But it makes it porous, and the work needs to be repaired.



One puts in lead for a large work to make it run, but not
<-not
for-> in a small one because it would leave filth all around
the work.
