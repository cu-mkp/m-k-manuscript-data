For teeth

Sal ammoniac i ℥, rock salt
1 ℥, alum half an
℥. Make water with the retort, and
as soon as you touch the tooth, the tartar & blackness will go
away. It is true that it has a bad odor, but you can mix it
    with rose honey & a little cinnamon or
clove oil.









Antimony oil

It yellows quite strongly, even silver, if you put it on it
being heated.









Against falling sickness or vertigo

Hung round the neck, wear root of peony
which should be picked at the waning of the moon.









Crucibles

Those from Bayonne, which seem to be made of
grès are better, for they last, without comparison,
longer than others. And because they are not very thick, one wastes less
charcoal melting gold & silver, for they heat
quickly. They do not drink as much silver as the others,
& for this reason, there is hardly any residue to be
found in them. They are less prone to tipping as others that have a
flat foot.









Against diarrhea and dysentery

Against diarrhea, it is very good to use preserve of
symphytum, also called consolida maior. And
if it is against dysentery, you can rub with it the temples,
the hollow of the hands, & the soles of the feet
with wax oil & take one drop or two of it with a
spoonful of broth. The root of consolida
maior, pestled & put between <-pieces-> cuts
in a piece of beef, then boiled, rejoins them, as they say.
