Semi-lively colors

When colors aabsorb into the canvas, it
means that it has been given imprimatura only once, &amp; for this reason they
become matte rather than being shiny. But this is the best,
as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having
more body, do not die &amp; are all the more beautiful for it,
especially azure, lake, &amp; those do not have body. But
those who want to rush their painting apply imprimatura twice on the first go, to be
done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as
long. The second layer of these does not absorb &amp; remains
shiny.




        

        
    From nature
        

There are some who paint from nature on oiled paper, &amp;
if they do not finish in one go, they put their paper &amp;
unfinished picture in water so that it shall not dry.
        



Illuminators painting on paper temper their colors
with gum &amp; mix in a little soap to make them run
better.
        


           
Painters must all learn how to depict after nature, for to them
it is travel provisions &amp; revenue &amp; sure means of earning their
passage when travelling across the lands with only their
cocon.

artist’s l stroke &amp; will render your hand
nimble.
