Semi-lively colors

When colors aabsorb into the canvas, it
means that it has been given imprimatura only once, &amp; for this reason they
become matte rather than being shiny. But this is the best,
as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having
more body, do not die &amp; are all the more beautiful for it,
especially azure, lake, &amp; those do not have body. But
those who want to rush their painting apply imprimatura twice on the first go, to be
done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as
long. The second layer of these does not absorb &amp; remains
shiny.




        

        
    From nature
        

There are some who paint from nature on oiled paper, &amp;
if they do not finish in one go, they put their paper &amp;
unfinished picture in water so that it shall not dry.
        



Illuminators painting on paper temper their colors
with gum &amp; mix in a little soap to make them run
better.
        


           
Painters must all learn how to depict after nature, for to them
it is travel provisions &amp; revenue &amp; sure means of earning their
passage when travelling across the lands with only their
cocon.
        

    




Painting large figures

You need to put your charcoal at the tip of a stick
such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close,
you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain
&amp; sufficient distance. Also, you when you paint up close, hold your
charcoal at the farthest end, &amp; de practically with your
fingertips. For in this way you will acquire an
artistâ€™s l stroke &amp; will render your hand
nimble.







Glazing

One commonly glazes with colors that do not have body, such as
lake &amp; verdigris. However, to use other colors, one
mixes in a quantity of calcined &amp; ground cristallin, which also
has no body &amp; makes lightens the density of the others.







White and black

It is good that an apprentice should work with white
&amp; black for two or three years to become an
artist.







Lead white

It does not die &amp; has a lot of body.







Imprimatura



One needs to be quite careful about this, &amp; not make it, as some
will, with gold color which is made with the washings of
oil paintbrushes, because verdigris &amp;
other corrosive colors which are in it will in the end will make
the colors die that are meu layered on next. It is
good to do it


with ceruse, &amp; a bit of yellow ocher, &amp;
a little massicot, &amp; make it not very thick in order that it does
not crack.
