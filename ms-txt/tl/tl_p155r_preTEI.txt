Molding a rose

Because the little branches of the rose bush
which are aupart around the flower are sometimes
very spread out &amp; would make too large a mold, one makes
and molds them separately, and the rose &amp; some
buds separately. And then one joins with solder the little
branches &amp; leaves of the rose bush to the stem of the
rose on which one intentionally leaves the little tips of the
small branches. Put your leaf or rose as low as you can in the
mold because the sand always raises it up. You
en can also mold several petals together, once
arranged one on top of the other, separating them with threads,
as is said. And regarding the rose, you can give a thin layer
of melted butter on the back of the petal, of on
the first petals on the outside, not those on the inside
be, to fortify it &amp; give it the strength to
withstand, in order that the tempered sand does not spread out &amp;
expand more than it should. You them can also mold well
the leaves of rose bushes, strawberry plants, &amp;
similar things that are flat &amp; can be flattened without spoiling
them with two gates, for opening your mold when it is reheated,
&amp; cleaning the ashes from it, All and making vents
&amp; several gates. And this is the easiest way, but the other can also
be done. And with small veins of wax adapted &amp; joined from leaf to
leaf, you can make gates. You can even make a vein of wax from
the back of the first petal until, which will join
to the gate. All of this facilitates the cast. Aulcu
The principal thing is to let your reheated molds cool down
well rather than cleaning them &amp; blowing inside them to make the
wax come out, because when the mold is hot, the ash
holds to it as if attached. But when it is cold, it wanders and leaves
with the air or when one blows oneâ€™s breath through the small
opening.

    











You can well give a bit of thickness at the ends of the stalks that
support the leaves, anointing them lightly underneath with melted
butter, because the leaves are large &amp; weighty, and the stalk of
lead &amp; tin would not have enough strength.



I would be of the opinion to mold the rose on its own with a
little of its stem close to its bud, &amp; then to join it to a longer
one of tinned latten, because the rose in full bloom has great
volume &amp; weight.



Wet the rose with eau-de-vie before putting it in the
circle of clay. Do not forget to oil the wax gate. And when you have cast your tempered sand, blow
thoroughly until it begins to set. The rose came out
well. But because the sand finds itself mixed among the petals, make your
work soak in water for a long time in order that, shaking it in
the water, the earth is gone from it.
