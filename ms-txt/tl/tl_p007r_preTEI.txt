For gilding with gold color and tinsel

Once you have <-gilded-> colored, make your
stamping either in tin, as is said, or
in iron <-dest-> or copper. You ought not
to put a layer of glue there as on wood, but take only
fatty oil, which is made in seven or eight days in
the sun with walnut oil and lead white <-&
with->, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in
haste. Then, with the oil thus made fatty, grind a little lead
white, massicot & mine de plomb
<-[illegible]->, at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
Minium gives color to the gold. Next, with this, you make
a layer of it evenly on your stamping, taking care not to fill the hollows.
And once it is almost dry, lay the gold leaf on it with
cotton. Such gold will hold up in the rain on
houses & elsewhere. And if you have gilded with tinsel, color
it with smoke of partridge or of yellow or red
cloth, & it will be beautiful like fine gold. You can
cover trunks, mirrors, valences & bedposts with colored
velvet or satin, then apply the gilded stampings
on top with strong glue.





For coloring stamped trunks

The stamping of sheets of copper or latten is made on engraved & carved
service tree wood, if one wants to spend less. And next, the stamped object is
colored with the aforesaid colors of lake, verdet,
azur d’esmail, & tempered in turpentine varnish.
But in the place you want to azure, lay down fer
blanc, which is more appropriate for an azure
background.





Doublets

Good dragon’s blood soaked in eau-de-vie
carries its mastic or glue in itself, as do
sap green & saffron.





Fish glue or isinglass and
mouth glue

It is made from codfish skin, boiled rather than
being salted. Joiners glue their masterpieces
with it and guitar maker[illegible] use it for delicate works.
It wants to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently in barely boiling
water.

Mouth glue is made of parchment scrapings and
one uses it without fire, for glueing paper or similar things, 
wetting it with the mouth.



One beats it and soaks it in <-in eau-de-vie-> <-of
vinegar-> white wine for one
night, then one melts it on a slow fire. Others soak
it in eau-de-vie.
