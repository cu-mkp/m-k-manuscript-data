Blacks

Black of charcoal from the mines, of ordinary
charcoal, of burnt ivory, of peach pits, of
lamp smoke, of burnt bones of the feet of
oxen.





Shadows

When you are making a painting with several persons, just as the
flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows.





In fresco

Azure is not good here, but wan, & one needs to work
with long paintbrushes. Fresco is not used
    <-cont-> on wood.





Azure

Turpentine oil renders it very beautiful. Test palma christi seed oil.
Walnut oil in Flanders costs at least a hundred
sous a pint. The azure requires a little
fatty oil because it has no body.





Azur d’esmail hates more than any other to be ground,
especially with water, for it dies & loses all its color.
However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with
water but with oil & grind it thickly, and in this
way it will not die as much.





Always choose the most delicate one.







Paintbrushes

When the color has dried inside, & you want to clean them, soak
them in spike lavender oil and they immediately will
turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in
walnut oil. Walnut oil is not <-as
not-> as appropriate to soften them as that of spike
lavender, which is clear like water & penetrates
& does not have body like walnut oil. The handle
of paintbrushes is made by those who work with
care from porcupine quills,
by others from wood of arrows from Turkey
<-with whom-> with which they also make small rods to rest
their hand when they are painting.





To work well on a small scale very thin paintbrushes which
have a firm point [<-z->] are<-on-> needed. And because a 
squirrel’s tail hair is soft,
the most careful take the bristles of the oldest rats,
especially of dormice if they can find them, & put two or
three of them in the middle of the paintbrush. These make
a straight line like a quill & all the other
hairs
    

of the paintbrush stick to them as to the
point. The bristles of beech martens & weasels
& small animals that make musk are even better, for a
single hair in a paintbrush suffices.
