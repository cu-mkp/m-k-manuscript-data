Tablets

Some are made from boxwood inlaid with ebony,
sandalwood, ivory, or gold and silver like
damascening. Then one writes on it with silverpoint, and
next erases it with a cuttlefish bone by
rubbing them.







Letter, more legible

One cuts the largest pieces of beryl or crystal round
on one side & flat on the other, then one sets it with a little
handle and one sets down the flat side on the letter.







Stamping

If you have some bronze medal & you want to make it very
light, make of it a hollow form of lead, then spread upon it some thin
plate of gold, or plates of lead or [<-annealed->]
annealed silver, & set your bronze medal on top
& strike with a wooden mallet.







Softening horn



Those who <-acou-> mount Agnus Dei & make circles from
horn for certain little boxes soften <-ladicte->
the said circles by soaking them in hot water and next fashion them
on a round or oval-shaped triblet.







Ears

When some defluxion occurs there, one needs
to be very careful not to put anything inside, and according to the
proverb, one ought only to touch the
ear & the eye with the elbow. However, it
is good to put on an affected ear musked cotton, that is
to say, kept in musk, for it comforts quite well.







Toothache

Some put a clove of garlic in the ear which
is on the side where the tooth is hurting, & within two or
three hours they feel well because of
it. Others put in the nostril which is on the side of the
ailing tooth green skin scraped from the <-e->
small branch of visaube, namely
the kind which is under the grey one which resembles a small branch.
