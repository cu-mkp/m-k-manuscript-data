A way for molding excellently with water



Dissolve in humid place some sandiver, and then
place this water on what you want to mold, having encircled it,
and place it to coagulate on the hot ashes. Do the same with
vitriol & copperas, which, once well calcined, reduce
in water.






Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other



It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper, latten or
similar metal, very neatly, and then when you have molded the
hollow form in the sand, leave the figure of metal that you
[<-s->] have molded in the frame, without moving it
from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a
little & push the figure down in the frame.



It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the
filth & grime accumulate. And, in this way, if you
were mold the face toward the cast, some grime could be found
there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
to repair.



Vinegar is better for moistening than wine. It is
necessary that the frame be quite smooth and even otherwise,
<-And that the cast be-> as you press on one side, the other one
lifts.



This is why the press is better, for it tightens evenly, &
more than your hands, and makes

the coarse sand, which is humid, communicate its humidity to the
soft & fine sand, which is sprinkled & pounced dry
on the medal.



When you mold, always leave your medal in <-the one->
some frames, <-Is-> without stirring
it because, if your hollow form is not molded very neatly, you can put
it back in the right place by means of pegs, which will prevent
it from shifting. But, at first, pounce your medal with very
fine willow charcoal, & <-se-> next
clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release afterward.

Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the
frame & the sand.




Bellows

To melt with bellows, & hasten your melt,
& also cast hotter <-po->, do not place your
bellows at the bottom near the foot of the furnace,
for fear that some charcoal might <-you-> enter it, put
them almost under the grate. It is good that your
four Ã  vent be in an aerated place so that the
wind might make it heat better, & that it be well dry,
& reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the furnace
& that there is only the entry of the blast-pipe of the
bellows. And by the end, you need to give it force,
as at the beginning you will blow gently.
