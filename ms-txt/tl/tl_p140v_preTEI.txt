engrave on silver &amp; copper with aquafortis. With
this also, one takes the hollow form of the relief &amp; then one casts in
this hollow form some tempered sand, which once more represents the relief very
neatly. And then, you can cast on this one its hollow form in
copper, gold, and silver, and make seals of great
singularity.

For casting in sulfur



To cast neatly in sulfur, arrange the bread pith under the
brazier, as you know. Mold in it what you want &amp; let dry,
&amp; you will have very neat work.




Try sulfur passed through melted wax, because it no longer
inflames &amp; no longer makes eyelets.







        
I tried plaster &amp;
brick alone and molded en noyau like others. My
mold was very neat, having lightly oiled &amp; rubbed
with eau-de-vie my medal. I made my gate ample at the entrance,
becoming narrower up to the medal, which was very thin. I notched the gate
which embraced well the medal. I dried the mold well on a slow
fire &amp;, at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let it
cool in such a way that I could hold my finger
to it without burning myself. I made an alloy of 4
℥ of tin &amp; six
deniers of lead. I cast red, and it came out
well. Next, I put in for 4 ℥ of
tin, xii deniers of lead; it came out
very well.
        

            
When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat
it for lead &amp; tin. But for flowers &amp; what should
burn, yes.




Molding and shrinking a large figure



Mold it with bread pith coming from the oven, or
as the aforesaid, &amp; in drying out, it will shrink &amp; consequently the
medal that you will cast in it. You it can, by this means, by
elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith, vary the figure
&amp; with one image make many various ones. Bread coming from
the oven is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts
more. You can cast sulfur without leaving the imprint of the
bread to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you
want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.





Casting of lead and tin in plaster



If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very
weighty and that does not need to burn in the mold, you can
cast in plaster &amp; brick, mixed like above, and not in
plaster alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if
it is not accompanied. But, with brick, it holds well.
However, take heed to dry out your mold at length &amp; on a
slow fire &amp; with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But
when your work is of flowers or other things that want to
be their molds reheated &amp; set ablaze, mix in some
feather alum &amp; even some crocum. I have
molded in plaster &amp; brick very neatly, &amp; it
withstood several castings.
