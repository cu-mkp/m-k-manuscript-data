   etch on silver &amp; copper with aquafortis. With this also, one takes the hollow form of the relief &amp; then one casts in this hollow form some tempered sand, which once more represents the relief very neatly. And then, you can cast on this one its hollow form in copper, gold, and silver, and make seals of great singularity.  Seals   For casting in sulfur  To cast neatly in sulfur, arrange the bread pith under the brazier, as you know. Mold in it what you want &amp; let dry, &amp; you will have very neat work.  Try sulfur passed through melted wax, because it no longer inflames &amp; no longer makes eyelets.   Molding and shrinking a large figure  Mold it with bread pith coming from the oven, or as the aforesaid, &amp; in drying out, it will shrink &amp; consequently the medal that you will cast in it. You it can, by this means, by elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith, vary the figure &amp; with one image make many various ones. Bread coming from the oven is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts more. You can cast sulfur without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.   Casting of lead and tin in plaster  If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very weighty and that does not need to burn in the mold, you can cast in plaster &amp; brick, mixed like above, and not in plaster alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if it is not accompanied. But, with brick, it holds well. However, take heed to dry out your mold at length &amp; on a slow fire &amp; with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But when your work is of flowers or other things that want to be their molds reheated &amp; set ablaze, mix in some feather alum &amp; even some crocum. I have molded in plaster &amp; brick very neatly, &amp; it withstood several castings.  I tried plaster &amp; brick alone and molded en noyau like others. My mold was very neat, having lightly oiled &amp; rubbed with eau-de-vie my medal. I made my gate ample at the entrance, becoming narrower up to the medal, which was very thin. I notched the gate which embraced well the medal. I dried the mold well on a slow fire &amp;, at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let it cool in such a way that I could hold my finger to it without burning myself. I made an alloy of 4 ℥ of tin &amp; six deniers of lead. I cast red, and it came out well. Next, I put in for 4 ℥ of tin, xii deniers of lead; it came out very well.  When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat it for lead &amp; tin. But for flowers &amp; what should burn, yes.
