For preserving

Acetum paratum ex rutabaccis juniperi 
simul tusis. Eo aceto extinguantur lateres igniti et vapor excipiatur 
ore & naribus.

garment can be thus perfumed & removing its infection, 
the room, house, &c. If you find yourself in a place where
you do not have this preparation, carry rue &
seedspestled together, then, according to
your need, boil them in vinegar and use as above.
