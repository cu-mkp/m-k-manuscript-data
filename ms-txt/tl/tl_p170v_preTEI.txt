        Against plague
        
        Take, against pestilential fever or poison or plague, an

            scabious or bugloss water

        Acetum paratum ex ruta baccis juniperi 
            simul tusis. Eo aceto extinguantur lateres igniti et vapor excipiatur

            your need, boil them in vinegar and use as above.
