To hold the cores, some use wire of the same
metal that they cast because it reduces <-with-> &
melts with its counterpart, but because when melting or folding, the
core changes, some find it better to <-r-> use
iron wire, sharpened at the ends, because it holds
firmer & having delicate ends, it appears as no more than a point of
a needle. And one can apply gold or silver before using
it for a work. If it makes a hole, one covers it with a small
chisel.

Eau-de-vie prevents the sand from becoming porous & does
not make little holes on the edges of the mold if the thing to
mold is well moistened with it. The holes & blisters & bubbles
are not made on the side of the mold, which is thick, but at
the edges, which are thinner.

One casts with common silver, with which goldsmiths
commonly work, which alloys <-And qua-> indifferently.
And when one were to cast with solder, it would run even
better.

Spat is a whitish stone which can
be found in Germany, & mainly in Augsburg, which
one uses for the most excellent sand that can be found for lead,
tin, copper, silver & gold. And the more
it is used, the better it is. It is appropriate for casting flat things
in a frame. For round things, it is not as fitting nor does
it hold in the fire as well as the aforesaid one made with
plaster.

The shreds of <-cui-> thick, greasy leather
are <-p->good to cast in the molten
copper and latten, for it cleans it & removes from it all its
filth. 





Spalt

Spalt is white like cooked plaster and can be found in
mounds and stones formed in long scales & long veins. It is
very soft, such that with a fingernail one can scrape
it, & makes a powder like our chalk from Champagne.
And because everything which comes from [<-s->] the earth is mixed
with some other substance, to purify it, one grinds it, coming from the
quarry, quite coarsely, then one mixes it with sal
ammoniac water. <-M-> By putting in a piece the size of a
walnut in a large bottle of water, and
