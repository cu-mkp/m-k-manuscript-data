Double layers

The Flemish & those who paint panels by the dozen only
make one layer & finish at the first go, but the colors soon die.
And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer
them lightly & not very thick, to soften them well.






*
Or mat



        
It is made with massicot, minium, ocre de ru, 
& yellow ocher, in order that the composition
resembles gold. Gild the day after <-one
jo-> it is laid down if you <-in the-> make the
seat for the color in the evening.



        
Shadows
        
For women, asphaltum, umber, & a little
lake.
        




After having gilded,
let it dry
& rest one
day, next rub the gilding
with a feather & cotton in order
that no protrusions remain, then varnish with Flanders
varnish, which you make mixed with a little eau-de-vie,
to render it desiccative.




        
Painting in distemper on wood
        
Because it is very tedious to paint in distemper on
wood, and because one is at pains to make a good
<-a-> face on it, some thin their colors with glair of egg
passed through a sponge, or mixed with the yolk,
water, & thoroughly beaten with the peelings of the fig
tree. With this 
| they paint & soften on the wood,
as with oil, and this supports the varnish, but this does
not last.
        






The varnish will be dry in an hour. It
will increase the color of gold. And this or mat holds
in the rain, even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried
for eight or ten days.



Gold color that is
made of different
colors cleaned
from paintbrushes for
oil is not so good, & with time,
tarnishes the gold because of the verdigris. One
must not touch with a finger the layer made for
the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The or
moulu is spoiled
if water touches it, but the or
mat holds well in the rain & in water.
One must not burnish it, because the tooth would remove it.
Gather the protrusions & small
flakes that the cotton makes lift off when the gold is
dry & you clean it, for an ounce is still gold. In
Flanders,
women <-make-> gild.
It is more beautiful when it is
a little thick, but in France
they beat it too delicately.
    
    

    

        
Colors in oil that are imbibed
        
It is best that colors in oil are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
oil has remained in that part, which would make the colors die.
The varnish mends all this & unites & renders it similar
in one place as in another. | It is necessary that gold color be laid down thick, for if it were clear, it
would be imbibed & would run.
        
           
On canvas & in
distemper, one gilds
with bole
& honey &
a little garlic juice.
        

    
    

        
Gilding molding for panels with or mat
        
see the other side of this folio this mark:
*
        
The Flemish give a layer of distemper glue 
on the molding, then mix lamp black or
soot black with the same glue & let dry.
Next they pounce some moresque in the corners & paint it
with minium, massicot, & ocre de ru,
and a little yellow ocher, tempered with fatty oil
in which they clean their paintbrushes for oil,
because the three aforesaid colors are gripping & dry immediately.
Next they lay down the gold, then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
oil, but it would not be good because the gold would
attach itself everywhere & not only to the moresque. Go
back to the top to *






        
Breathe on the gold color, and if it fogs up, it is dry enough,
but if it does not receive the vapor of the breath, it is not
enough.
    

One ought not to gild with or mat after <-with->
having gilded. But wait one day or one night, <-But
take heed not to-> and when it is as if dry, it grips the
gold. Next, one varnishes.
