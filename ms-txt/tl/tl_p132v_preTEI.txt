by itself. When it begins to redden, it is soon red everywhere.
But make sure, through the gate, that it is red at the bottom & that
nothing appears black.




Common sand from the mine

In a frame, if one casts hot, it becomes porous; therefore,
one only needs to dry it out.


    



Crocum ferri

Having <-d-> passed it through vinegar &
reddened it in the fire, I had it finely ground on porphyry,
until no roughness was perceived on the fingernail. Then,
I wet it with very good vinegar & 
left it there <-a-> two or three days, stirring
it several times each day. Finally, I boiled it
& reddened <-in-> the pot &
crocum all together in the four Ã 
vent. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that
can be pulverized very finely between the fingers. I
put some in the sand, <-a-> half as much as
feather alum. I tempered the sand quite thinly & molded
out of it a very small female lizard, which molded very neatly &
delicately & very finely. The crocum ferri does not
render the mold harder, but it firms it. And when your
mold is soft & fatty when scraping it with the
fingernail, it is a sign that the crocum is
good, very fine, & well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the
mold, because it is a friend to gold. And I believe that
silver would come out well. And that the mold, through
this means, does not crack. Make it from filings of
needles.


        
I have tried to make it so the molds where it is mixed do not crack
during reheating & thus do not make flashing.
    

        
It is better made with distilled vinegar.



One can put some amongst the molds, where you want to cast
silver, for it firms the molds, and you will find it so,
by scraping a little harder than the other where there is none. It molds
very neatly.



This one is appropriate for all molds & keeps them from
breaking & bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands
several casts. The one of steel fillings & needles is redder
& better.




Gilding animals cast in silver

You can gild them with amalgam without spoiling any
of the features, if they are made of silver.
