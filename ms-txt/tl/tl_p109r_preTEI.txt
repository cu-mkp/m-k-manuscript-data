Modeling in wax

When wax is too hard, one mixes in turpentine or a
little butter, which <-are pl-> renders the
wax more amiable and more appropriate than the tallow
that the Italians put in, because one often has to put the
tools in the mouth, which are better in boxwood or bone of hart.







Wax for molding -

As the wax is melted, they have sulfur that is
melted in a spoon or crucible, & they pour some
in the melted wax. And going to the bottom or
remaining on top, the sulfur leaves & mixes only its substance amongst the
wax & renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
having molded, it melts in the mold gently like butter, without leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be advised not to give it too strong a fire.

In order that your mold grips without repelling in any place on
a shape or image of wax, you need to anoint it with oil
and moisten your sand with lukewarm water, for the cold
water would repel the oil more & would not have a good seating on it.





Anoint well, very lightly, with oil, so little that it hardly
appears. Then, rub with some eau-de-vie. Next, moisten your sand
with lukewarm water so that it does not repel the
oil.






Bellows of the forge

It is better that they should be fixed through the blast-pipe in some piece of
thick plank, <-q-> for they are more secure for it; next, you can lightly
secure them from above. It is necessary that blast-pipes be 4
fingers above the sole of the forge.






Snakes for molding

When you take them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove
their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
removed, they get sore gums & mouth, & can no longer eat. You
can keep them in a barrel full of bran or even better of
earth, in a cool place, or in a glass
bottle. And give them any live frog or other little live animal,
for they do not eat anything dead. Also, I have noticed that
