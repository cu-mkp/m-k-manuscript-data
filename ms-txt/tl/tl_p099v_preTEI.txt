Quince trees

They want to be pruned often, otherwise they die &amp; do not bear
such beautiful fruit.





Cannons

They are very difficult to bore when they are of
metal because the substance is brittle &amp; frangible. But one
z ought not to push the borer with too
great a force nor continue all in one push, but pull it out often. In
that case, one makes the touch-hole muzzle of the
cannon bigger than the ball in order to avoid the necessity of
boring, because the substance is cast &amp; expands &amp;
pushes the mold. If the borer, which should be neither like a swallow
tail nor a point but be cut in the round like a wimble, if it breaks, one ought not to leave it there to rust
+



+ 
but immediately take it out of the touch-hole. This
you will do by pouring a little oil on it; then,
l turn the place of the touch-hole downward &amp;
strike the opposite side of the piece, &amp; it will fall down. One
needs to bore gently &amp; at ease when the piece is of
metal.




Bells

One does not make them in the pit if they do not fit.




Gilding your moldings for panels without
gold

Some take orpiment in leaf form &amp; pulverize it &amp; make
moresque leaves &amp; burnish it, and it is this
orpiment which is shiny like gold. However, ground
metals or ground cristallin or touchstone are
better.




Orpiment orange

One sublimates it &amp; one grinds it, &amp; some put in a little
arsenic to make it melt instead.





Varnish

Some make the one of mastic with two ounces of
mastic and one of clear &amp; white turpentine oil &amp;
eau-de-vie as above. Heat it on ashes until it is melted,
then let it rest &amp; put it in another vessel to purge it of
dregs.
