Quince trees

They want to be pruned often, otherwise they die & do not bear
such beautiful fruit.





Cannons

They are very difficult to bore when they are of
metal because the substance is brittle & frangible. But one
<-z-> ought not to push the borer with too
great a force nor continue all in one push, but pull it out often. In
that case, one makes the <-touch-hole-> muzzle of the
cannon bigger than the ball in order to avoid the necessity of
boring, because the substance is cast & expands &
pushes the mold. If the borer, which should be neither like a swallow
tail nor a point but be cut in the round like a wimble, if it breaks, one ought not to leave it there to rust

+ 
but immediately take it out of the touch-hole. This
you will do by pouring a little oil on it; then,
<-l-> turn the place of the touch-hole downward &
strike the opposite side of the piece, & it will fall down. One
needs to bore gently & at ease when the piece is of
metal.




Bells

One does not make them in the pit if they do not fit.




Gilding <-your-> moldings for panels without
gold

Some take orpiment in leaf form & pulverize it & make
moresque leaves & burnish it, and it is this
orpiment which is shiny like gold. However, ground
metals or ground cristallin or touchstone are
better.




Orange from orpiment

One sublimates it & one grinds it, & some put in a little
arsenic to make it melt instead.





Varnish

Some make the one of mastic with two ounces of
mastic and one of clear & white turpentine oil &
eau-de-vie as above. Heat it on ashes until it is melted,
then let it rest & put it in another vessel to purge it of
dregs.
