<-Sand-> Mixture easy to melt

One <-℥ of-> part
soft tin, one part fine lead, one part
looking-glass tin & one part fixed quicksilver makes an alloy & a
solder so easy to melt that it can easily be melted in a
dish of fine tin.




Molding hollow on one side and in relief on the other

And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine tin, which is
harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves
it in one half of the frame & presses it a little so that
it holds better. And next, you will cast in your frame some
solder described above, or another more meltable than fine
tin. And thus, the second medal will melt & mold itself on the
first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix
some lamp black with water &, with a
paintbrush, give a light coat of this to the medal, which
remains in the frame, & leave to dry. Thus it will not
melt.

But if you have a medal of copper or silver, you can
leave it in the cast if you want to cast with lead or
tin. But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold
would make the tin contract.

Tin wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.

Soft tin, which is the best for the cast, is the
one that, once cast in grille, is <-burnished
&-> shiny & polished like a mirror, & appears to have
been burnished. And does not have holes like the one that is brittle &
that is not shiny as if burnished.




Potin

Potin, being cast hot, runs & flows like tin. But
the medal becomes whitish from this, and immediately casts out the
verd, which a good material does not
do.
