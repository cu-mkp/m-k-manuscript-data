Sand from river tellins and
mussels

The long shells that one finds in fresh
water rivers, once calcined, make an impalpable white sand, which
molds very neatly.




Congealing mercury

It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two
hours in a rather large iron pot,
putting in, for an ℥ of
☿, ii ℥ of
verdet <-of-> and vitriol of
saltpeter ana, with sufficient quantity of old
water from farriers.

Or else, melt 4 ℥ of tin, & as
it cools, purify it of its filth, which is on top, then, make a
hole in it & put in this i ℥ of
☿ & it will come out like tin if you
remelt it, but it will be breakable. And if you want to assay if it is
tin or ☿, redden a shovel &
put a small piece of your ingot on top. If it is tin, it will melt
& stay, but if it is ☿, will quickly melt,
then, crackling quite strongly, it will take flight. One ought to congeal it in
a spoon or in a hollow crucible & make a
moderately sized hole.

It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in aquafortis which beforehand will have eaten a little silver.
This one, mixed, makes tin & lead run.




Mixture

Fine tin, congealed mercury with the smell of
tin, looking-glass tin, fine lead, as much of
one as the other, makes a substance that melts very promptly but is
breakable & white. I think that it would be good for solder.
A long time to cool.
