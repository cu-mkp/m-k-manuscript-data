  Sand from river tellins and mussels The long shells that one finds in fresh water rivers, once calcined, make an impalpable white sand, which molds very neatly.   Congealing mercury It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two hours in a rather large iron pot, putting in, for an ℥ of ☿, ii ℥ of verdet de and vitriol of saltpeter, ana, with sufficient quantity of old water from farriers. Or else, melt 4 ℥ of tin, &amp; as it cools, purify it of its filth, which is on top, then, make a hole in it &amp; put in this i ℥ of ☿ &amp; it will come out like tin if you remelt it, but it will be breakable. And if you want to assay if it is tin or ☿, redden a shovel &amp; put a small piece of your ingot on top. If it is tin, it will melt &amp; stay, but if it is ☿, will quickly melt, then, crackling quite strongly, it will evaporate. One ought to congeal it in a spoon or in a hollow crucible &amp; make a moderately sized hole. It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in aquafortis which beforehand will have eaten a little silver. This one, mixed, makes tin &amp; lead run.   Mixture Fine tin, congealed mercury with the smell of tin, looking-glass tin, fine lead, as much of one as the other, makes a substance that melts very promptly but is breakable &amp; white. I think that it would be good for solder. A long time to cool.
