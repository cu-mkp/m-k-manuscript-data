Molding vases in several pieces

Goldsmiths who work in large wares and plate get whatever
wooden forms they please turned on a lathe. And then,
with some wax, they model on top masks, festoons, and whatever
they please. And next they mold in three, in four, or several
pieces.







Gold solder

They take, for one gold denier, one
grain of the fine alloy, like old
douzains are.







Molding a fly

Large flies can be molded & <-g-> made
by casting. But one needs <-par d-> to anoint underneath
their wings with wheat oil, which dries quickly and
fortifies them & gives them a little thickness. The same is done to
butterflies, cicadas, grasshoppers &
similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some
leaf or bouquet. The others are made by hand with a very
thin silver sheet. One ought not to keep them once dead,
because they dry out and their legs break.



Wheat oil is put underneath delicate things to render
them more rigid & firm & to make them hold their natural
position. Because being weak & delicate, the tempered sand, weighing down
their tops, would change their form.





Bat

They have very thin wings, & if they are large & dry and
their wings extended, one would need a very large mold & it
would not be certain that the metal would run sufficiently. Thus,
when you want to mold them, choose the medium-sized ones & make the
pose <-qu-> so that they have their wings half folded. Because in
this way they will come out better, but support the side of the wings
with wax, as you know, to feed the cast well.
