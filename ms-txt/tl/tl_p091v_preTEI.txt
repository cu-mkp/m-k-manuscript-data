since the two bones are joined,
<-co-> cut them evenly all around, & make notches
<-e-> around it in different places which cross over the
join of the two bones, in order to recognize well the
place of the first join. Or else, with little shards of
wood, pierce them, or <-ma-> coat the
joins with some clay, & dry. Press, <-between them->
your hands joined between your two knees
& not with a press, because the bones would
crack. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see
that it is pressed quite tightly together & well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, pounce with some
willow charcoal, for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with oil & with willow
charcoal powder & with a brush, to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not too greasy or oily when you mold in
cuttlefish bone. When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some bone. And cast moderately hot,
which you will know when the bone is about to change
its <-good-> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it turns
the bone very red. The proportion of lead
& tin is as much of one as of the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out & of several pieces, make the gate forked with three or
four grooves, <-and-> <-make-> & direct these grooves to the
place of the thicker parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like straight on the heads, for this attracts the metal & feeds
the figure better. Shake your frame a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. Tin that is too
hot <-p->burns the bone, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out <-from the mo-> hot from the mold, it risks
breaking.
