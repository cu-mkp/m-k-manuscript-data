Tempering sand for molds of flat medals

Flat medals of wax or metal are oiled very
lightly &amp; then are touched with a paintbrush with
eau-de-vie. And in order that the mold, wetted with
water, takes without refusing the oiled thing, one heats
the water well for tempering the sand, for with cold water
it would refuse. Medals are oiled because they are not malleable
&amp; thus could break the mold. And animals, which are
malleable, do not want to be oiled. Hot water should be
of such heat that you cannot hold your finger
there without feeling strong heat. Temper your sand thicker for flat medals &amp; solids than for lizards &amp; fine things.
Your sand having set, clean &amp; scrape your mold on one side
&amp; the other, &amp; make a notch at the foot &amp; the border of the
medal on the side of the gate, in order that you can take it away
better. Lower also the mold, scraping the 
medal all around, in order that, from all sides, you can take it away
without it corrupting the mold. Next, make your scorings around
of the the first mold cast mes,
in order that the second cast joins with it without varying, &amp;
especially make a notch at the bottom of the mold
where the head of the molded thing is. Make some also at the sides of
the gate. This done, dip the reverse of the first mold in
water, oil it, &amp; thus it will not be imbibed. Rub
the reverse of the medal with eau-de-vie &amp; secondly cast,
tempering in hot water. If you have molded a medal en noyau, 
having made the first cast &amp; this one having set,
outline, with the point of a knife, the surround of the medal,
in order that it is raised on the cast &amp; not buried in it. Then
having made the second cast &amp; having opened your mold,
have take away the medal in one go, with one two
knife points q, and that one takes it from
the side of the gate &amp; the other from the side of the head, which is
opposite.



Take care not to oil your medal too much, for if the oil
seeps out, it diverts the sand from becoming smooth &amp; amassing, &amp;
makes it wavy &amp; lumpy. One should only touch the middle of the medal
of the p with the point of an oiled
paintbrush, &amp; then spread the oil everywhere.




Make especially sure that the gate is the widest you can
p toward the medal &amp; embraces it well, that the
entrance of the gate is ample, always narrowing toward the medal. Do
not forget also to notch the entrance of the gate.
