Ash in the molds

One needs to let the mold cool before blowing to make the
ashes go out. For when the mold is hot, they adhere
against it, & once cold, they separate from it more easily 
& go away in the blowing with the wind as vapor.





Molding a bird

One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
on a clay slab, and hide & sink within it half the
said bird, in order that it only shows one leg
& one foot, then you will anoint it with butter to make it
hold the feathers down, finally <-of oil->
eau-de-vie. And then cast. And being set, clean &
uncover whatever needs it. Next, mold the other side in the same way. But
because the feet, being of bone that is difficult to burn & which
are not able to be cleaned neither by quicksilver
<-If-> nor by any other means, if the mold would not
open, uncover the bottom of the feet & the toe or the little finger
of the claw, & mold as a separate piece. Reheat & open your
mold & clean the bones. The feet usually remain too
weak to support the mass of a solid bird. And for this reason,
one adapts an iron wire in the mold of the
feet which passes into the body before casting; thus, they are
reinforced. Some mold the wings in a frame. Others mold the
head & the said wings separately en noyau, then join &
repair them to first model a form that will be stiff & withstand the tempered sand.



They are skinned & filled with cotton cloth. &
even better, one needs to dress them in the fashion that curriers
do, in order that they do not lose a feather, weight. The
dressing is alum & paste of flour.
