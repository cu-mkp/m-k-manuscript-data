For casting in red copper

Pure red copper from a cauldron or other thin works
is appropriate for casting. And to make it run, throw in some sal
ammoniac, & when you are ready to cast, put in a little fine
tin & very little. And note that one needs to cast copper
very hot in the mold, which needs to also be inflamed &
entirely red like for gold, silver, latten &
metal. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it is
smooth, thin & shiny like a mirror <-of cu-> of
steel, newly polished, or like melted silver. Keep it from
the wind, for it will quickly cool. Stop the cast with
tows <-or-> to keep it from cooling.
    
    
 Red copper
comes out more neatly than latten, which has strong smoke
that prevents it from running. I molded it en noyau neatly like
the principal & thin like paper. It is necessary that it
be so hot that it is white & shiny & polished like melted
silver and like a mirror. I cast it in the same sand as
above en noyau.



Copper and latten are the longest to melt, longer than any
other metal, especially red copper. But also it flows
& comes out very neat, provided that it is cast very hot, that it is
like water.



Removing your mold from the fire, plant it in
[<-d->]<-es-> a brazier that fills a pot or
a vessel.






Huile tingente to make metals run

Take some â˜¿ sublimate of Venice,
true & not arsenic sublimate, a pea, aes
ustum, a pea, sal ammoniac, a pea.
Pulverize everything separately, & next mix everything in a
glass bottle & put on hot ash. You will see
that everything dissolves like wax, making many colors. Let it
<-everything-> set & put a little of it on each
melted metal, & it will run marvelously.



Founders of large casts for statues throw in much
tartar to clean it of its filth & nastiness,
& much sal ammoniac to render it thin & neat. And when
they want to cast, they put in much tin. The cold &
humidity strongly disagrees with it, which renders dangerous the
work of the founder, for one only needs a spring of
water in the pit to lose everything.






Clamps

They are made with flat pincers of iron wire,
reheated & refolded, then beaten at the ends on the anvil.
When they are thus fine, they are subject to burning, being put often
in the molds for reheating. Therefore, use some new ones.
