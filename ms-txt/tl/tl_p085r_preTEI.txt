to rest on a very clean & smooth table, & since it
is desiccative, I knew it would dry out <-lor->, which I
let it do in order to reduce it to powder & to mold it with sand, broken up with my fingers & the sharp edge of
a knife. I oiled my medal, because oil cleans it
without spoiling it. <-And-> And having dried it & cleaned it
with a linen cloth & very small hog bristle 
brushes, I once again lightly anointed it with clear
walnut oil & gently passed a linen cloth
over it so that it does not remain too anointed, and I noted that,
by this means, it would come out better in release, because the
ceruse, once moistened with water of glair of egg, would not
attach to the oil. This worked very well and I molded a medal of
high relief very neatly, without any sticking, which a lot of
good sands, such as felt, burnt bone & iron
dross, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it & my
mold became hard like marble, and by this I knew
that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some
water, which gives them body & compactness, such as glair, 
gummed water, <-ea-> wine boiled
with elm root, &c; and lightly oil the medal, it
withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as
glass. But even soft lead & brittle tin
<-v-> want to be cast very hot.

Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is
excellent & endures many castings & molds very neatly, nevertheless is fatty and makes things porous. Thus, soft lead <-and
the-> does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a lean
sand, such as pumice, scales & similar things to
give them body & so that they release better. For lean sands
barely release well and yet they receive metal well.





Try to mix ceruse or minium with other sands.


X
Oil & anoint with aspic oil, which will go
away when reheating, for the oil makes it porous.



One ought to moisten with glair, then mix it well. And once in
the frame, beat on top with a pestle, or other
appropriate thing, for this makes it mold better and release better. 



It would be good to fill the frame all at once, for the
mixture that is made of several sands with that of the
mine, with which you fill the frame, corrupts
it.





Green varnish for medals of copper

Having cast them very neatly, cover them with sel de
verre that we use for sand & moisten it, & in three or
4 days it will be green. Next, oil them & keep
them under the dung.





Glue

The Flemish reglue their earthen pots with
gold color, that is to say minium, massicot &
varnish.
