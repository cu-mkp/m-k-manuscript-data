Molding hollow for seals or other things

First, model your figure in wax on a piece of
glass or smooth slate. Next, mold it with our
aforesaid sand, <-l-> having first anointed lightly
with oil, as you know, & then rubbed with eau-de-vie,
<-having-> and tempering your sand with hot water. Having
the hollow form, cast it in alloyed lead, in the same form as  other figures that you make very neatly. However, if it did not come
out at all neatly, repair it. And then, <-cast some-> mold
with some wax on the relief of lead, & you will
have a very neat hollow form in the wax, which comes out very neatly
on the lead. Next, in the hollow form of wax, cast your tempered sand, which will make for you a relief, on which you will cast your
hollow form in silver or another metal for seals. But note
that you should not make your hollow form with melted wax, but rather,
only heated in warm water, or, even better, in warm
urine. Or else, if you have a relief of gold or
silver, or other metal, very <-faÃ§o-> neat
& repaired, imprint on top your hollow form of wax, & then in
the latter, cast your sand, which will come out in relief, on which you will next cast your hollow form for seals or other works. You could even
cast a hollow form on the principal of metal relief, &
even with lead & tin, which will not melt the
principal if it is lightly anointed with crushed chalk with a paintbrush, or smoked with candle smoke or with
dried glair of egg.

When you have imprinted your seal of
wax, mold en noyau this piece of wax, which is
hollow, like your seal, & your noyau will render it molded,
similar to <-u-> the imprint & the seal.



It is necessary that your wax be mixed with some color which
hardly has body in order that you see the imprint better. Lamp
smoke or soot black is good for this. White wax, for
this effect, is <-exc-> better.





Giving the thickness that you wish to a medal

Having cast your first mold, mix [illegible]
crocum or well-ground iron scales to firm it up.
And having set & rendered your hollow form very neat, take some
paste of fine
