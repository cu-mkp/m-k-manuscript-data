Note that you need
to lute well your crucible,
in order that the substances
do not take air, for
they are exhaled.



  
Lute well your crucible,
in order that it does not break.
For if it breaks, the
substances evaporate
& the fume of it is
dangerous. If within xii
hours it is not melted
and mixed, it will not be
well made.




Goldsmiths who have knowledge of this substance sell a
denier of it for five sous to other
goldsmiths, & especially to those who work in plate
and large wares, for at the end of their works, they can solder
over the first solder by means of this mixture. In general, all
those who want to mold & cast something delicate. This material
should not be divulged, lest it be abused.



The grain is like broken steel.

    

Take these substances, of the best kind you can find. Weigh them as
said above, and pestle them separately, keeping your
face covered, over the nose & the
mouth, from the eyes down, to avoid the exhalations of
arsenic, sublimate, and orpiment. Mix them well, all
together, then put them in a good crucible that is so large
that the substances can have the fourth or fifth part as empty space.
Cover the crucible with a good tile, adapted in a
circle precisely on its opening. And having bound it from top to bottom
and on the sides with iron wire quite strongly, lute it
with earth mixed with dung or founder’s earth that artillery
founders use. And in this, be careful & diligent, & do
not forget to mix in pestled glass throughout the lute to
fortify your crucible in such a manner that it takes no air, for the
substance would be worth little, because the <-4->
five last ingredients would be exhaled.
