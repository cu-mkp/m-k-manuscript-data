Animals dried in the oven for a long
time



Plant them on a slab of earth, arranging them with
points of iron wire, as if you wanted to mold them, and
<-they-> dry them in an oven after the bread
has been taken out. And they always remain thus, as much for
snakes, as birds and other things. But it is
necessary that they be dried promptly.







Note that one needs to give them their shape & put them in the sand,
as with flowers, & promptly dry them in the oven, which is
hot enough, like when one takes out the bread. And it
should stay there a day & a night in order that
it is <-chau-> dry, for otherwise it would be
smelly. However, take heed that the oven not be too
harsh, but rather like the heat of the sun in
June, otherwise the animals cook. Once dry, do not
wet them, but clean them with a paintbrush or clean them
with a brush.







Animals cast in copper

Try, <-d-> having cast them in copper, to burnish
them like gemstone foils, to see if they take color
similarly.




    


Advice concerning the gate

<-Do not-> Be careful to not make your gate very wide, and do not
forget to make in its conduit two or three holes and notches, & as
your gate approaches the <-ch-> molded thing, divide it
into three or four parts like fingers which are pointed &
are not very deep. For the metal runs more gently without being
hindered by vapors & fumes.



Always make
the entry of the gate
near the medal
notched & lumpy,
to draw out the fury of the
metal.

    











Spider molded on a leaf



The very big ones usually have hairy feet, which are
vexing to mold if you do not lay them flat, or burn them with a
candle, or stiffen them & lay them flat <-with
some->, anointing them with wheat oil. Kill
them in vinegar & urine, like snakes
<-&->, or in eau-de-vie, and then shape them on a
well-made vine leaf or other thing. Next, you can give them back their
capricious hair with <-bourr-> the sieved
fine hair of cloth waste, having anointed them <-with a-> with
fish glue or similar. Their true color is of
vinegar & verdet, & then fumigate them in various
places with sulfur. Having made your <-tourt->
clay slab, place on it your vine leaf, and the
dead spider in the middle, & pierce with a point of
iron or latten wire the middle of the spiderâ€™s body
& the leaf together. Next, place diagonally small points of
latten wire around the vine leaf to secure it well.
Then fix, with a little melted wax and the point of a hot
iron wire, the end of the legs, adapting them with the end
of small pincers. Do the same thing with the end of the
small cornicles of the spider. Return ðŸœŠ

    

To make the gate
for the spider on the
leaf and to prevent
the sand from covering the spider from underneath the
belly, furnish the end of the
tail & the bottom of the body with a
little wax, melted & applied with the hot iron
wire, as you know. In
this way, when the leaf burns & the
wax is melted, there will remain
two little holes in the leaf
which will be the gate of the spider.


ðŸœŠ
Once the wax is cool, scrape the excess with the point of a
penknife in order that the end of the legs stay neat. Next,
place the circle of earth around & cast your tempered
sand, like for other things. In this manner, you will need to burn the
vine leaf in the mold, otherwise not. And to cast more
easily, let the animal die fully, in order that, when struggling, it does
not mix up its legs. Having made your first cast, uncover the reverse of
the leaf and make the second cast.
