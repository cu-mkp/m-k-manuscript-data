Note that one needs to give them their shape &amp; put them in the sand, as with flowers, &amp; promptly dry them in the oven, which is hot enough, like when one takes out the bread. And it should stay there a day &amp; a night in order that it is chau dry, for otherwise it would be smelly.

Next, place the circle of earth around &amp; cast your tempered sand, like for other things. In this manner, you will need to burn the vine leaf in the mold, otherwise not. And to cast more easily, let the animal die fully, in order that, when struggling, it does not mix up its legs.
