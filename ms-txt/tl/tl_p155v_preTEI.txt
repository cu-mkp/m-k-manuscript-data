Rose

Because the flower in full bloom is billowy &amp; has its petals disordered
&amp; turned in various ways, it does not appear beautiful if it is not
painted &amp; also inasmuch as it has weight ou
for that the stem of tin, which is brittle &amp;
delicate, would be unable to support. One molds the flower of the
rose on its own &amp; separately, making its gate largeish in order
that it comes out b better. Then one cuts this gate
down closest to the stem of the bud, on which one grafts next &amp;
solders a stalk of latten wire to which one also
solders the leaves. But because tin, being thus thin, is
troublesome to solder, and any leaf can be melted, and also
because the cast flowers &amp; especially the rose are not
beautiful without being painted, one does not take pains to
solder, but one it grafts the pieces to join them
&amp; one glues them with fish glue that has been
a little tempered &amp; thickly melted. And in order that it imprints
better, one heats the tin work gently &amp; at a distance, for
once cold, the glue would not take. After your flower is thus
repaired, you follow the joints of the added parts with modeling wax esb, which is a white wax mixed with
much well-ground ceruse or, even better, lead
white, melting it &amp; applying it on your work with a small
hot point of iron. In this way you can repair these little
barbs that are in the middle of the rose or the holes
of the that may be in any petal. Next, you will paint your
rose according to nature. If you cast your rose in
gold or silver, you can join &amp; solder well. And
in these same metals, when you have something delicate to join to
the flower, like a fly or something similar, fish
glue is singular for it &amp; holds very well, fixing it with a
few small points which serve as nails. The leaves
&amp; buds can be molded in two molds that can be opened once
reheated, but not before. Next, these said things are joined.
