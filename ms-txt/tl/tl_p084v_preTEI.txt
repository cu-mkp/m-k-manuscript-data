Sand

I tried the bone of oxen feet, thoroughly burned &
pulverized & ground on porphyry, until it is
not felt between your fingers. It molds on its
own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid & lean, it
wants to be well wettted & moistened with wine boiled with
elm root.

Iron dross, well burned bone of oxen feet,
felt also well burned over a closed fire, and all three very well
ground on porphyry mold very neatly in lead,
without needing to be reheated a lot, & casting
<-it-> in a hot or cold frame.

Felt alone molds very neatly once moistened & releases
well, and also makes the other two release.



These sands only withstand one casting.



A fatty sand which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.





A fatty metal needs lean sand.






Eau magistra

Some people think that salt water is not good, because the
salt cracks in fire, & consequently should make it porous. There is only the wine boiled with elm
root.

Charcoal for pouncing makes for a good release, but
one finds that the one of willow makes it porous. The one
of oak or beech does <-make it porous-> well without making it
porous.



Try burnt oysters.




Lead

For casting, there is only soft lead that wants to be cast
very <-g-> hot, and soft tin.




Sand for lead, the most excellent of all, for high and low
reliefs

X I took ceruse and crushed it dry on
porphyry to make it very fine, then I moistened so
much with well-beaten glair of egg that it was like a paste,
smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a knife. I left it
a little




One ought to mix it well with a knife.
