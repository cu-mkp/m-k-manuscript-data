Press for large molds






    
      
The screw is riveted to this stirrup, which is
nailed onto the upper plate, & by this means,
raises it & presses it.



    
    


They are two sheets of iron attached by four
small iron pillars, in such a way, however, that
<-lles-> the upper is <-nt-> able to have play
& run freely the length of the pillars, & that the
lower one is fixed. At the end of the pillars is affixed an
iron St. Andrew's cross, in the middle of which is a
screw which tightens the sheets against the
molds which are between the two.
    
Or, for small molds,
one makes a frame, & having put the molds between
two plates of iron, one <-sets-> tightens them in
the frame with wedges.
    
The large wooden
presses made with screws, besides being heavy to put near to the
forge for casting, one cannot know when they tighten too much,
& very often, they break the mold.





Sand for flowers

If it is cast thick, it bears down too much on the flowers &
constricts them & reduces them as if massed together. Take heed
therefore to temper it until thin, & blow strongly before the flower
is covered. Cast at the side of the mold. And tempering the sand,
one ought not only to turn the spatula but to beat the sand in
water as if you were beating glair of egg.
