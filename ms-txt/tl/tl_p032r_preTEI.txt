The body of the cuirass

The high plates of the pauldron of the brassard  are like a
masterpiece of the masters, for it is necessary that
these pieces be very precisely hollowed &
adjusted in order that the movement may be free. Cuirass bodies
must be very evenly beaten & driven with the hammer.

Morions from Milan are all in one piece & thus better
than those that are of two.







Painter

As soon as the colors of panels are well dried, the Flemish
varnish them so they do not die any more than they already have & remain in that
state.

The one who knows to work well in distemper will work well in
oil. But, on the contrary, the one who knows how to work well in
oil will not work in distemper.







For layering gold in distemper

Common painters & scribes make
batture, that is joinerâ€™s glue tempered with
water on the fire, moderately clear, mixed with very little
honey, that is to say a few drops to make it stick. And
with it they form letters, or that which they want to gild,
with a paintbrush, and immediately after layer the
gold, but they never do their work quite neatly, and if there is
a lot of honey it dries only with great difficulty. This layer is
undone in the rain.

Others do better, they temper candy sugar in water and
mix it with sanguine that they call
cocon, thoroughly ground, adding in a little
soap. This is done neatly, & renders gold beautiful if
one uses it as the seat.
