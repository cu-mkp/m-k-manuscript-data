Counterproofing

Make some soap water &amp; with this, rub &amp; moisten the
intaglio piece that you want to counterproof, then lay white
paper on it &amp; rub very vigorously across the top with a
tooth or the bottom of a glass &amp; you will
transfer your printed piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but
if you oil your paper with spike lavender
&amp;or turpentine oil, it will represent
from the left the right on the other side. Then follow
these lines with a paintbrush or a quill, then heat the
paper &amp; the oil will go away &amp; leave your
paper white. And if you want this not to be known, if by chance,
you borrowed the piece, moisten the paper, and the polishing that
the burnisher has made on the back, which shows what has been
done, will not be known. The soap water will turn the piece
yellow, but well-gummed water, which has the same effect, does
not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make gummed
water, then mix some soap in it &amp; do as is said.





Cutters of printing plates

To clean the copper plates, or to make worn ones
print better, boil them for four or five good hours
in a good lye quite spent in the wash water. 
Then make your ink with some linseed
oil &amp; not with walnut oil &amp; press with the
rollers. The copper plates are sooner made than
wood blocks, but they are not so appropriate for
printing promptly. The wood ones are laborious but also will
sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other two. To
carve in wood, the secret is first to poach, that is to say to
lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the wood block
&amp; to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the
wood. Once dry, you then gently rub with a moist
handkerchief the back of the paper which, by rubbing, will
become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next,
one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated
glass &amp; coat with noir d’escaille, to then scrape
&amp; layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make ink for
copper plates



These rollers are good for promptly printing with cut cartons different kinds of pastes.



One can place the plates among the linen when the
lye is quite pure, or in a pot.

which is different from that of the printers, one needs
to boil walnut oil or, even better, linseed
oil for a long time. &amp; having boiled for a long
time, you will put in garlic &amp; bread
crusts to rid it of grease &amp; leave again to boil thoroughly,
then finally you put in one part of lampblack that you
have previously ground on marble with oil.
And finally you will mix everything as long as &amp; until
you see that the plate prints well. Which And when
you have spread the ink on it, wipe the plates well with
the surface of a piece of white paper. &amp; do this
until the paper looks clean and then print. If you were
to wipe the plates with a linen cloth, it would
remove the ink. Linseed oil thickens while
boiling &amp; becomes like a varnish &amp; is in danger of
catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make sure it is in an
open space or in a place where the flame cannot cause
damage. Some burn tartar until it is black &amp; grind it
with non-boiled linseed oil, or walnut
oil which others find to be better. This black is beautiful,
but the one of lamp smoke is blacker. When you want to print
fr, take with your fingertip of
the said black moderately thick, the whole plate having
first been cleaned in lye as said, then, rub it with the surface
of a piece of white paper until the
paper remains white &amp; do not touch it with the
bare hand because but with a piece
of paper applied on top. &amp; having cleaned the
plate perfectly, mi rub again with a
piece of paper, fold the edges &amp; sides. Next, take a
small even table &amp; on this a piece of
felt, then a few sheets of paper &amp;
finally the one you want to print on, which should be moistened between
two wet napkins. And on this sheet put your
plate then another piece of paper, &amp;
finally another felt. Then pass between the
rollers. And you can print a dozen pieces consecutively by
always charging the plate with ink &amp; cleaning it as you
have done. But if you desist from printing, the rest of the ink will dry
in the grooves of the plate. Thus you will have to boil it
in lye or urine, as already said, to clean it. The
rollers must not be too loose.
