Talcum mixed in the molds

I took the one from which I had pulled the oil. I crushed it
very finely even more s in a steel
mortar with a pestle, very lumpy like a file. I
rendered it very fine &amp; in a cottony &amp; downy powder. I mixed it
with sand &amp; mixed it together &amp; cast it en noyau. It
molded en no very neatly &amp; one ought not to doubt
that it holds in the fire.





Gold cast very thinly

When goldsmiths have something to solder promptly
and do not have leisure to forge it, they melt some
gold and then throw it on a cloth or other
things that withstand the fire, and they flatten it immediately
with a hammer or similar thing. And it ends up very thin &amp;
even receives the impression of the cloth.

Fine gold, not alloyed, can be cast in medals,
but not in plants &amp; lizards &amp; very fine things if it
is not alloyed.

A pansy anointed with wheat oil can be cast
in alloyed gold.

And other thin leaves, but only if the branch is not too big and
the leaves, separately cast, can be soldered.





Counterfeit diamonds put in a work

Give a light coat on the inside of the setting with black modeling wax, 
then anoint the inside, thus waxed, with
wheat oil, &amp; then powder this with lamp smoke,
for it is necessary that ceste its color not have
luster for false stones. This done, set in your stone
&amp; then with a bit of wax, then, with a
steel point &amp; a small finishing hammer,
join the edge of the setting to the stone in order that
daylight does not enter in. But keep from knocking the
stone, which would break.
