Painting plants of metal

If you are in a hurry, it would be better to mix your color with a
not-too-thick gum <-or-> because oil takes a
long time to dry and runs if it is layered thinly,
as the plants require. And if you still want it done promptly,
temper your color with glair beaten with peelings of the fig tree, 
and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
thinly.







For wormseed

 The pallid white of this herb is made from vert de terre,
white lead or ceruse, a bit of massicot, stil de
grain yellow, and cendr√© of azure. Mix & compose
your color according to a natural branch that you will have. 







Viper color



It is the most beautiful snake that can be molded, because it
has very beautiful scales, & hard & transparent. Its true color
is made with good verdigris ground well with some good
vinegar, if it is of lead or tin. And if it is in some
place darker, fumigate this first color with sulfur, as you
know. And if one needs to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub
with coarse linen. The male ejects from its
nature, which is at the bottom, when it is
firmly pressed, a little mass like half an arquebus ball
made in the genitals and full of very venomous spurs.





+ Put a bit of metalline in your
tin & your lizard will resemble silver.







Molded roses



They are awkward to mold because the petals are very fine & weak
& doubled. But, to <-obl-> avoid this, one needs to
anoint them with wheat oil, which is very dessicative. And having
quickly dried, it firms & stiffens the petals to be able to separate
them & withstand the tempered sand. The same is done with flies,
with pansies & similar delicate things, with flowers from
the caper plant.
