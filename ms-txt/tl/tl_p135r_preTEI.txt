Couleur for gold or mixture



Verdigris & sal ammoniac, as much of one as the
other, & as much as a bean of
saltpeter. For if you put a quantity in it, it would make it all boil
so much that it would boil over. Saltpeter is only put in to make
it boil, in order that one recognizes when the substance has boiled
enough.
    
    
 This couleur, put on brittle melted gold,
renders it soft immediately.

Softening gold





Gate



It is necessary that it be longish with regard to the thing that you
molded. And for big molds, at the very least, it is necessary
that it have four or five fingers of length. You can
make it wide up until the middle & then divide it in three points in
this way. And as much as the molded thing will be small, it is also necessary
that your points be small. And in the middle of the gate & of its
points, make there some openings in order to prevent the fury of the
metal & make it run gently. One also needs to
<-c-> conjoin the folded parts of the animal with little
notched lines, <-a-> especially the end of the tail or
other delicate part, in order that the metal flows everywhere
& carries itself from <-e l-> one part to the
other.



Do not forget to make a gate of wax for the feet of 
    
lizards & delicate things like this.





When you have molded an animal in the first part of the
mold, do not let this part dry before you have taken away the
said animal, for the mold, in drying, contracts and would also
make the animal contract. Keep it therefore in some moist &
humid place until you have

 done it.





Vine leaf and small frog



Take vine leaves to mold as they are in growth, likewise with
all plants & flowers, or a young vine growing again after
having been cut, or when they rebud in autumn, because the
new leaves are more lumpy & have more apparent lineation. On the
contrary, old leaves are smooth on the inside & pierced in several
places. Therefore place your leaf bottom down on the clay
slab, and secure it with small points, nevertheless
leaving it its natural curve. And make a notch in the
clay to hide the stem at the first cast, which, once made
& dry, you will take away the stem from the leaf & clean with it
well with small bristle brushes & fix it with a small mound
of clay. Next, make several gates around the leaf with wax,
as you know, & <-gec-> make the gate thin & with
several lines & lumpy.




The vine leaf is painted with green made of stil de grain
yellow & verd de terre.




You can cast on the leaf a spider or frog &
whatever you will like.
