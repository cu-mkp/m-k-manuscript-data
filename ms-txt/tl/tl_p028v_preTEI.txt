Pewterers

They deem the best tin is the one that comes in
saulmons, which has not been remelted since it came from the
mine, because the masters remelt it a in
grille, weighing two or three lb, to easily
cut it up and sell it by the piece. And in this they often make a mixture of
leftovers from plates, solder &amp; common tin.
And to recognize the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks
burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their saulmons they find pieces of iron, stones &amp; similar
jumble to cheat on the weight. The tin from England is so hard that the miners put in
lead to soften it. The one that comes by way of Germany
is softer. Commonly, the sworn master pewterers, from
bonnes villes, add six lb of fine
lead on or eight on a quintal of fine
tin. The others, who work in the countryside,
put fifteen or 20 or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness
of the lead they and its softness, they put in
looking-glass tin, 4 lb per quintal,
+ po which whitens &amp; hardens,
and a little six or eight lb of rosette on a
quintal to render the plate sonorous. 



To mold platters &amp; dishes, they make them out of pierre
porte morte, which is
grais, &amp; they turn &amp; polish around
them on the wheel. They melt their tin in an
dest iron pot on a charcoal fire, and with an iron spoon that holds
almost a sufficient quantity for a platter, they cast
leu in their cold molds, which they keep
joined &amp; tight between their knees. And soon after, they
open the molds so that they do not heat up, &amp; having taken
out the cast which is on the female side, &amp; which breaks easily.
Then, with a cloth which soaks in water, which they
always have beside them, they rub the middle of the back of the dish
&amp; around the edge, so that it comes out better, and rub the
female mold with it.

When the tin is fine, one adds less glass-looking tin,
namely 4 lb per quintal, but if the tin is base, 
that is to say alloyed with a lot of lead, one puts
at least five or six lb of looking-glass tin to it.





If there is hardly any looking-glass tin, one puts about two or
three lb per quintal. One puts eight lb of
rosette. But if there is a lot of looking-glass tin
one, like 4 or 5 lb, one only puts six of
rosette. And commonly, per quintal of tin, one
adds x lb of both.
