The mold of earth is reheated until, sometimes, it
is as if red, for otherwise the metal would spatter &amp;
would not do anything good. And similarly, the noyau on the
inside should be very reheated, &amp; mixed with charcoal
powder.





Wax for seal and imprint

For the large wax seals, you need to have tepid water
always ready &amp; apre keep your wax in
it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your hands
to render it very uniform, for otherwise the water that would get in
between would prevent it from becoming uniform. Next, you will press it into
whatever you want and put three or four pieces of paper on, &amp;
with a stick you even &amp; round like a
pestle, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
will attach itself to the paper, which will help you lift it off
the mold. Thus you will imprint better than if you were to cast it
molten. You can carve the figures &amp; gild them, silver them, &amp;
paint them with colors in varnish, &amp; transfer them onto a
base of glass painted with colors in turpentine &amp;
mastic. And if you want to apply these plates by incrustation, do it
with gum ammoniac  tempered with vinegar, and you will have
good glue.




For casting in plaster

Melt some wax, &amp; with a large brush coat the
relief of which you want to have the hollow form, as if you wanted to paint
it. And a light crust upon which qu will form,
upon which you will cast you plaster, to give it body
and strength. Next, in the hollow form of wax, you will also cast your
plaster in order to have your relief, &amp; it will release very
easily because of the wax. This is done more for large
pieces in high relief than for others.
