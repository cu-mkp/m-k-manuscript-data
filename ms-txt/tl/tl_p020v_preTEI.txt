For whitening the face

Pestle puffball in cistern water, & no
other, & wash with this whitened water. This is considered
quite singular. And I believe that making it from wheat
starch & to use it would be even better.







Against winds, colic, &c

Sap squeezed or water <-[illegible]-> distilled from
orange peel is excellent against the windy colic.
Candied peel, too, is excellent for the winds of the
belly. And to make a trial of it, having poured foaming
wine in a glass, squeeze orange
juice on the wine foam, which proceeds only from vapor &
wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also,
if you squeeze juice against a candle it will burn all
the brighter.









Skirret root

They want to be planted in a very humid place where with such a
rodier well or fountain one can water it often, for by
this means they are tender. Otherwise a hard heart forms inside,
which takes from it all its goodness.









Against burn

Pestle an onion with verjuice & leave it
to soak like this, then apply it.

Or else, apply black soap on the burn. Experimented.









Common saying

Bell tower of Rodez, church of Albi,
bells of Mende. However, one holds the bell of
    Toulouse named Cardaillac as one of the most beautiful in
France, all the more since it weighs two hundred and fifty
quintals.









A form of regimen

Every morning, take two or three eggs laid one or
two days ago. Heat them <-until-> & do not cook
them. Take the centers well dusted with sugar. And next
drink one finger of wine. And apart from being
nourishing, it makes a good stomach.
