Painting on crystal or glass

They paint in oil without lines, except for the faces where
they trace the nose &amp; the mouth with black in small work, then they
make strokes &amp; highlights in white, next they coat all with
flesh color. And as for the ground, they make it with azur d’Acre 
for more beauty, or with lake for a quickly-done red, 
or with dragon’s blood for the most beauty. But
one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even &amp; of
one color, &amp; thus for other colors. Next, they put underneath it a
foil backing for topaz, or one of gold or
silver.







Infusion of anthos or
rosemary

In the month of August, the flower is better
cooked &amp; more suitable for making oil. Take of it whatever
quantity you like, and put it into a bottle
afterward, well stoppered, &amp; leave to wilt in there
in the shade for a day. Then put in it
the first substance of wine, &amp;
leave it to rest three or four days, and next express the
whole into another vessel, &amp; into this very same
substance of wine, put in
seven or eight infusions of new flowers. Next, leave the last
infusion in the sun for a month.
Next, distil it through an alembic. Ne And take ii
ounces of this water in two or three
spoonfuls of white wine, but this is for the
elderly. Paul III used it.







Cast

Tin comes out better being thin &amp; fine rather than
thick, because being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore,
if you want to mold a thick piece in tin, mold it only on one
side &amp; with a cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way
you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to solder
two halves together. But if you must mold it thick, make it in the
form, &amp; mold a lot of feeders 
    

around the figure, in this way.
