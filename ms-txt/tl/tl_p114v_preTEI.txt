This thus prepared, place your <-de-> first
half-mold on the cake of <-earth->
clay, & put the circle also around, & make the mark for
the thickness similar to the first. Then, with another rather thickish
paintbrush, moisten well everywhere the uncovered half
<-& the belly-> of your animal
<-And-> with eau-de-vie,
without leaving anything, if it is possible, which is not moistened, for
this is the secret which makes it come out neat. And next, as promptly
as will be possible for you, before the eau-de-vie
<-not-> evaporates, wet your sand and cast it in thrusts and by blowing & moving the mold as you did
for the first one, making sure that the <-first q->
beginning of that which you pour on the animal should be a little lighter than the
next one so that it moistens everywhere & closely follows the more delicate
parts. So, leave it for a quarter of an hour to set, then
remove the circle & the clay cake. And, with a
knife, arrange your two molds uniformly together in a
long shape of a mandore, as mentioned, because of the cast.
Then, dip a little the whole mold evenly, at the level of the
joints, in water, for this is another secret to unjoin them,
otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore, by
this means, and next, extract gently & with patience and method
the half of the animal remaining in one of the molds,
<-for-> pulling it sometimes from one side & sometimes from
the other, to avoid breaking any of it, or also spoiling something from
the mold. <-And-> The latter being empty,
<-extract-> rejoin the two halves so that no dust
enters it, & put them aside until you want to reheat them, make the
gate & vents, & place the clamps. As for the animal, so
that it does not dry & that you might be able to mold it four of
five times, put it in water. And I think that it would keep even
better in eau-de-vie. However, the best would be to mold
in the same day the 4 or 5 molds that you can do,
because these corrupt animals in themselves stink within one day. Having left your molds one or two
<-es-> days to dry, for they stay
humid for a good month, make the vents on one
half 






+ Note that when you have made your second
cast, were you to leave your mold for one
day or a night without opening
it, you would need to then dip it in hot water or else reheat it
before opening it, as for crabs.




If, after both halves of the noyau have made a strong & hard set, you
would not dip your mold in water, it would not unjoin at
all. But as you dip the reverse of the mold in water,
the imbibed oil collects at the top & at the level of the
joints & makes it separate.




However, take heed your second mold is of good thickness &
that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having
dipped it in water, & you want to open it, there is a risk
that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open
it, dip all of it in water and rub it everywhere,
where it will harden if it has set well. Then, take your two
molds, joined with a rough linen cloth in
order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you
wanted to tear apart a loaf of bread. But if it happens to break, join
it & on the reverse, strengthen the joints with clamps.









Next, you can repair the faults with small chisels.
