The end is bought ready-made by the
dozen, which costs six sous for
the small ones, but for the the big ones 2
carolus. The end <-this-> is put either
with nails, which are put on the sides of the cutting edge, but
this only spoils the sword & destroys the scabbard because the
water enters through the joint of the nail. It is best to
apply some rosin or glue on it, but rosin is better.
And it is best when the end is well adjusted & set so hot that the
pulverized rosin melts on the end. In this way, it does not fall
and cannot be undone unless it is put in the fire.

Guards are of several kinds:

Worked

Guttered, which is with round moldings

Pearled

Scarfed, when the bands are crosswise

Onioned, which is with a flat head

In the King’s manner, which are plain

The furbishers buy them by dozens, the
dozen of plain ones commonly costs x lb. The
worked piece, 30 sous or depending on its
fashion.

The first thing the apprentice does is to furbish as
said.

And next, to garnish the sword & make a scabbard, which is the
height of the art.

They buy the wood pieces of
beech wood for scabbards which are ready made, a hundred for xv or xx or 30
sous, depending on the distance from the place
where they are made.

These wood pieces are thus called
estelles, and have to be
very neat & without any knots & are one finger’s
thickness across.

Then the furbisher puts them on a small bench, called a
scabbard bench, and with a <-e->
<-plane-> small iron
tool similar to that of the joiners’ bench,
they make it hold firmly. Then, with a <-plane->
plane which is like a knife with two
handles, one works the wood
roughly from the top, next one passes the joiner’s
plane on it the better to even it. Next, one scours it on the
inside with a
