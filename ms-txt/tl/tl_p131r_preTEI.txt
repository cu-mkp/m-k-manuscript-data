Plants that are awkward to burn in the mold

Mold them with two or three casts, which, once reheated, will open,
& it will be easier for you to take away the charcoal from
inside.

Letters and molded paper

Write with well gummed ink or with any color which has body
& which does not erase once moistened with eau-de-vie.
Then, place your paper on a clay slab &
moisten it with eau-de-vie and cast on one side & the

gold leaf & adapt it to whatever you want, and fill the

orpiment & little grains of diverse colors.

been held under your armpit. Which must be a bad drug, & for
the master, if he is red-haired, & for the apprentice
too.

And then, if you think about taking away these waxes composed of
things coming from the metals reheated in the mold, you
will be wrong, because, the asperity of the fire making them seethe
<-ir->, the wax goes away & the composition
of the ceruse or other metallic color attacks the mold.
And for this reason, if you want to rough out something

Nota

White wax is more delicate than the other & it does not leave
any filth when you want to make noyau and mold
hollow.
