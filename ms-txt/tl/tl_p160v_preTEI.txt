Molding a foot or hand

Mix resin among the wax, & having incorporated it
well, soften them in hot water or urine, &
then make an imprint by pressing, & next cast in plaster,
& it will come out quite neat & will release well.




Delicate work of gold and of silver

One can make flies from it by hand without casting, &
the wings & feet can be joined by solder, which cannot be done with delicate works of lead & tin because
they would melt. And the work of gold can be
enameled.




Catching crayfish

Attach to the tip of a stick some liver or lung of a
cow or sheep, & with a small string
you make a basket hang from the tip of the said
stick. Put in water where crayfish eat,
& they will quickly come to accumulate on the flesh. Extract gently
from the water, & those who want to go back into the
water will fall into the basket.




Catching passerines

If they sleep in straw, like they usually do,
close to the house, leave the closest window open & put
in a lighted candle, but so that the candle is hidden
& that its light only appears throughout the room & through the
window, and all will enclose themselves in the room. But it is necessary
that the night be dark & without

Catching birds

In winter, when the birds have molted, skin them
& fill them with stuffing cloth <-&->, or
else dry them in an oven #. Then arrange
them on the trees, & have someone who sings, & you will
gather them & catch many.



in an oven that is scarcely hot <-In
winter->. <-il->And in summer
this is done because, before they
    

    
would be dried, the fly would
get into their eyes and make worms. In
winter they are prepared better & dry by themselves
