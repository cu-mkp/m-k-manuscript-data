Black varnish

It is said, at the beginning of the book
where you can see it, that it is made with galipot.









Gilding

One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very soft, file such that there
is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heats them,
& passes them as is said. But to gild
& gild with silver, they ought not to pass more than a little
 beyond blue. Then, while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a vise,
& with some tweezers, one layers the gold, & one
sets it with bloodstone that is quite clean & rubbed with
putty. And when the guards are cold, one reheats them,
then one layers the gold as above. And first, one gives
<-of-> two layers, until the entire guard is well-garnished. And
next, one reheats as at the beginning, & one gives the third covering
of gold. Then, one burnishes very thoroughly & with great
force with a large bloodstone. <-And-> But note that
for burnishing well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to
know this, one smells it & brings it close to the
nose. For one ought not to touch it with the
fingers, but one <-holds it on-> lifts it from on top of
the warm ashes with a small iron rod, which has
been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is
completely well-burnished, one rubs it very well with a white
linen cloth, and the gold needs to be thicker &
stronger than for painters. A quarteron is worth
fifty or lx sous.







Gilding with silver

One needs to prepare the guards & whiten them with a 
<-li[illegible]-> file, a little coarser
<-for-> than for gold. And one makes them pass beyond
grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
silver foil, then separate it with a knife; next, apply
it to the guard with <-a small-> tweezers
& a small burnisher. And then, reheat & apply until they
are all gilt with silver. Next, one needs to cover them for the
third time with the doubled foil, as has been said, then burnish them
very well & with force, not with the bloodstone but with a
strong burnisher. Just as the burnisher ought not to
burnish gold.
