Earth for casting, for founders

It renders itself fatty once beaten and also mixed with
horse dung. Potterâ€™s earth would be
too fatty and would crack & would not hold in the fire, but one needs
to mix it with half as much sand and a quarter
or a fifth of horse dung. And leave
it to dry, then turn it to powder, then sift it to render it fine &
purged of gravel, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The dung
renders the earth more amiable & tractable, but it
is necessary that it be well free of straw & other things.
And when the earth is very fatty, one needs to give it more sand
& more dung. But one does find fatty earths,
in and of themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, do it by artifice.
One always needs to reheat the earths before casting.





Garden lily

If one breaks it at its first blossom & it will bud & bloom
only in the following year, & I believe
bulbous herbs do this.





Sand

The sand <-cast-> for casting should be chosen neither so
lean that it has no hold, nor too fatty. And although it is found
in nature, it is nonetheless not everywhere. And if you
are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with
fatty earth, for the sand does not want it at all, for it makes
it very porous. But you can give it bond with brick thoroughly
ground on marble, or plaster or calcined
alabaster or something similar, or the burned marrow of
ox horn or burned aspalte throughout. If you grind it quite
finely on porphyry, it <-s-> acquires
hold & then you can burn it with aspalte or mix
it with a quarter part of tripoli. Guard against
bread falling into your sand because it makes it very
porous.





Try mixing in soot black.





Ducks

Young domestic ones do not grow for a month
after they are hatched, but remain in this state. But after that they grow quickly, 
especially if they go into the water. One feeds them with boiled
millet grains, crumbling in bread for them
and scattering in well chopped lettuces.
