Files

If they are not trempées à pacquet, that is, in the fashion
described, with soot, salt, & vinegar, they
will not be good. The <-square-> large square files used
by locksmiths for their rough work are only made of
soft iron, but the soft files must be made of
steel. Founders whose work is to repair latten
& copper must have their files <-d->
coarse otherwise they would fill up with the copper which would
make them smooth & soon render them useless. Latten, which is
more brittle, welcomes softer files than copper
does.





Bones of the foot of oxen for sand

Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very
neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the
flame of straw. But if you mold them en noyau, give it
its first layer, simple & very thin, with a
paintbrush, & leave to dry at ease. Next, fortify the
following layers with wadding mixed with the said tempered
sand of bone.



It is the neatest sand that can be found for copper.





Essential oils

Walnut oil mixed with as much of
turpentine & distilled through an alembic renders an
essence whiter than common water. But this has no body & does
not give bond to colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
the color without hold and fading. These, imbibing in this way,
would not give you leisure to work and soften any more than in distemper. But
you mend this defect by giving it a little body with
turpentine, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
work with azur d’esmail & will make a perfect
lead white. Turpentine varnish made with this oil
is dry in one hour.
