Varnish

To a half lb of spike lavender oil, put in
4 â„¥ of sandarac &amp; mastic subtly pulverized. 
And first, boil your oil in a
pot on a chafing dish, and then mix in little by
little the aforesaid gums, stirring continually with a
small stick split and quartered at the tip, &amp; when you do
not collect gum with the tip, that is to say that it is totally
melted &amp; that your varnish is done. And to render it clearer,
put in a small lump of camphor to decoct. It is true that
with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the spike
lavender oil be good, clear &amp; not fatty, otherwise
your varnish would be worth nothing. You can test it
d by soaking some paper in it &amp; heating
it. If the oil, which will evaporate, leaves the paper
clean, without being a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is
fatty.







Sheep fat

In a certain region of England, the sheep that
graze there have very yellow fat and are nevertheless just as good as
others.







Spider

In Ireland, there are none, &amp; if one touches them
with wood that is there, they die. This is why some
rich people of England make their ceilings from this
wood, &amp; by this method, they never have cobwebs
&amp; spiderwebs.







Sand

Grindings are very good for casting in
copper, but one ought not to take those of
cutlers, because it is only sludge, but rather those
of those who grind mold large shears.

Pierres de filieres, with which those who sharpen, mold very neatly, once scraped, for lead. It is
commonly slate-colored. One frequently brings them to
Toulouse from around Carcassonne .
