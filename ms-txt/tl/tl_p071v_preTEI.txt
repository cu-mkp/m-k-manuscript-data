Varnish

To a half lb of spike lavender oil, put in
4 â„¥ of sandarac & mastic subtly pulverized. 
And first, boil your oil in a
pot on a chafing dish, and then mix in little by
little the aforesaid gums, stirring continually with a
small stick split and quartered at the tip, & when you do
not collect gum with the tip, that is to say that it is totally
melted & that your varnish is done. And to render it clearer,
put in a small lump of camphor to decoct. It is true that
with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the spike
lavender oil be good, clear & not fatty, otherwise
your varnish would be worth nothing. You can test it,
<-d-> soaking some paper in it & heating
it. If the oil, which will evaporate, leaves the paper
clean, without <-being-> a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is
fatty.







Sheep fat

In a certain region of England, the sheep that
graze there have very yellow fat and are nevertheless just as good as
others.







Spider

In Ireland, there are none, & if one touches them
with wood that is there, they die. This is why some
rich people of England make their ceilings from this
wood, & by this method, they never have cobwebs
& spiderwebs.







Sand

Grindings are very good for casting in
copper, but one ought not to take those of
cutlers, because it is only sludge, but rather those
of those who <-mold-> grind large shears.

Pierres de filieres, with which
those who sharpen smooth, mold very neatly, once scraped, for lead. It is
commonly slate-colored. One frequently brings them to
Toulouse from around Carcassonne.
