perfume & suchlike. But take heed that it is
necessary that the black wax with which you mold be
hard, in order that, quickly & <-du-> more dryly,
it retracts, in order to see if it is well imprinted. It is rendered
harder by adding into the already melted one more melted sulfur
& a little rosin.





        


& join & solder a tail of latten wire with
solder. The lumps on a flower are a small matter, for this can
be removed with the chaple, but let the leaves come
out well, then the paint covers everything.
    







Currency medals

One makes the relief puncheons of untempered steel,
then one tempers them, & with these one
strikes on matrices, not reddened in fire, as some think, but
on steeled iron, reheated & softened, which one quenches afterward.








Casting

Do not cast in one go, for in doing so, the metal is
regurgitated, & <-in-> [<-&->] the
metal gets cold before it goes down. But cast bit by bit &
taking your time.







Clamps

When you put them back the second time, make sure that the
mold does not shift.







Molds

Those of noyau, in being reheated, want to be set on
charcoals a little spent, without the air touching
them, like the frame molds want to be <-recu->
dried in the open & uncovered.







Thick works of tin

They do not want to be cast in lead or red tin like
thin & delicate things. It is enough if it is <-f->
well melted & hot. Thin things want to be quite hot & of red
tin.







Cleaning closed molds

One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for when hot, they retain the ash. When cold, they are cleaned better. Take a thin wire of latten or a delicate straw to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the gate. Blow into it & suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
thicken the tail with wax, then cut it,
