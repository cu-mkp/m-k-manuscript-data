Molding stucco promptly

Grind & pulverize finely brick or Armenian
bole or sanguine & incorporate it with melted wax,

goldsmith’s forge with three or four small
half-burnt charcoals, and blew only with my mouth. And
nonetheless the thing came to <-redden &-> ignition & turned
completely white, not only on its surface but also inside, & then I
let it cool on its own near the fire, for otherwise, exposing

it through my lead <-tin-> wheel, 
where I found it as hard as before, & uncovering the white
a little, I found it a fair flesh color. Finally, I polished it &
saw that it took a very beautiful polish & could paragon a
very beautiful agate for cutting some beautiful face on it &
bringing it on <-the-> a table of
