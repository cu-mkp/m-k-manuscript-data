Face in distemper

Because colors in distemper dry promptly & one would not
have leisure to perfect the shadows & touches on the face, one wets
the reverse of the face which is on canvas with a wet
sponge. Then, with a small paintbrush, one makes
the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
areas. And with another paintbrush, one redoes the shadows
by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
because they are made of bistre, which stains the canvas
like rust. The said bistre is good <-with-> for
making shadows in distemper <-mix->, for in oil it
has no body & would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in
the said bistre, for shadow, ocre de ru & a [<-a->]
little sap green. The best bistre is the greasy &
shiny kind from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is
difficult to grind & screeches on the marble.





Azure

Azur dâ€™esmail always wants to be cleaned, because the
filth that can be perceived in the wash water makes it die. One needs
to layer it two times, & the first very thick, moving the
paintbrush by layering it first lengthwise then across.
 It is better used on canvas, where it is imbibed
immediately, than on wood. Varnish returns it to its
vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To assay it,
painters bring their palette to the
grocers, & temper & alloy it with a little white
ground in oil, for in this way, the beautiful shows its
turquine vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
delicate is the best for working. It is made finer <-working-> by
washing it.





Violet and lake

It is made of azure & lake, which is also assayed
on the palette with white. The one is deemed beautiful that, on a polished knife or on glass, 
gives<-u-> a
clear <-red-> color of red rose, tending a little toward violet.
The one that is <-noi-> dark red is not as pleasant.
