This is the true measure of the caliber, but the borer
always takes away a little more.

    













Petard

They are made better in crucible form, hollow at the
narrower at the bottom &amp; becoming larger toward the muzzle. It is
necessary to pestle the powder thoroughly &amp; put on top of it either
sand or cork or better still a fitted plate of wax
thoroughly pestled on top, for it seals precisely &amp; makes for
greater force. The ball only makes a hole, the powder alone makes
more of an effect. One holds that, once loaded &amp; kept in a dry place
for fifteen days, they have more force.
