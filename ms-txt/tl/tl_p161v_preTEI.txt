Crocum ferri

It is promptly made if you put the filings, well cleaned
& washed, in an iron case, two
fingers high & covered, & redden it thus in a
reverberatory furnace, having washed it in good vinegar
for the space of a day. And it will be well burnt
<-p-> & clean, mixed and ground finely on
marble. Being well ground & once it is quite fine,
<-the-> the vinegar will bite it quite easily & will
soon give it redness & bonding, wetting it with the strongest you
can find & next setting it aflame. And in three or 4
<-ignitions-> wettings & ignitions, it will be ready. This one
is columbine color & is found firmer for casting than that which is
redder & the color of <-minium->
bole, made of rusty filings
<-coe->, & has more tincture. Others burn the
filings several times on a reddened iron shovel,
showering it each time with vinegar.
