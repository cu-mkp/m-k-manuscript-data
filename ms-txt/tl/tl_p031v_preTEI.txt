Painter

Scribes achieve darkening of lake & other
colors for garments with egg yolk, but this is trumpery and
does not last.

Others glaze reds from minium & others which are not
beautiful in oil <-M-> using glair of 
egg, and it appears to be done in oil. But
humidity corrupts all this.







Brushes

Take those that have been used a little by white-limers,
for the harshness of the lime & use make them more handleable.







Painting from nature

One ought not to undertake to work on it in overcast
weather because you would make your flesh colors browner than
one ought to.







    Painting on glass

For blue, they take the coarsest azur d’esmail & grind it
on shale, & mix in two or three rosary
beads’ worth of rocaille or more, according to the
quantity of the work. And having done their drawing with noir
d’escaille (which is painted toward the light with the piece
of glass upright), they lay all their pieces on white
paper <-when-> for knowing by the whiteness of the
paper the lighting of their histories and <-as->
set down all colors which are of one kind all in one go. Then they heat
it up.
