Fanciful tables

You can make various grooved compartments & in these, put
fishes painted from nature & with colors on simple
carton, & if you please, on silvered &
burnished paper which will represent the scales. And next,
cover this with very clear lantern horn. You can apply the same
to other works.





Planting trees

 One needs to plant them in <-dry place->
dry weather, & gather plenty of earth at the
foot all around, like a mound, in order that the rains do not fill
the holes & drown the trees.





Casting

I have tried four kinds of sand for lead & tin:
chalk, pestled glass, tripoli & burnt
linen, all 4 excellent. But as for the chalk, it needs to
be of the softest kind you can find, like the Champagne one
that painters use. It releases very neatly, does not want
to be moistened with magistra or anything else, but needs to be
completely dry, in its natural state, finely
pulverized. The first cast is always the
neatest; however, it will well withstand two or three. But there is only
the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake
your frame mold to take new powdered chalk that has not
yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the frame has
dried out & does not have as much hold & bond like the fresh one.
Pestled glass can be made from common glass sand, however,
cristallin is more excellent, for common glass contains
<-glass-> salt of saltwort only, but
cristallin contains both salt of tartar &
saltwort all together, which both help fusion, the glass
once calcined & reduced as if to its prime substance. In order to
calcine it perfectly, throw your pieces of glass, whichever it be,
among the largest possible lit charcoals that you can, if you are
    lacking another amenity <-t->for violent fire<-t->.
And when it is well red, throw it into
water



Putty is considered excellent for these two metals.
