Water to give light for the painter

Distill some vine water &amp; put
it into a big bottle. And behind this, put your
candle, &amp; it will not hinder your vision.







Frames of the Germans 

Germans who work in miniature make frames not of
glass, but of canvas anointed with clear turpentine
varnish, namely half turpentine oil &amp; almost
half turpentine, because this light, which is not as bright
as from glass, makes features appear larger to them. And when they want
to make something subtle like veins de &amp; similar
things, they use paintbrushes composed of two or three
rat whiskers.







Azur d’esmail in oil

One needs to choose the most beautiful delicate that
will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in
oil. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can
grind it well, not with water but with oil, &amp; grind it
thickly. Next lay it on your palette &amp; mix in a little
turpentine, but hardly any, to give it bond, and make it so that it is
thick like butter or mortar, &amp; then, with a fairly
large paintbrush, work it by always moving the
paintbrush back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch
across it in a tooth-like jagging with the the tip of the
paintbrush. The highlights will be made with
d the same thinned with ceruse,
which, giving it bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used
thus. It must be very thick, &amp; almost such that you are at pains to
spread it with the paintbrush. And it is all the better
if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it
is very subtle &amp; thin without being ground, and does not run.





Azure wants to be layered neatly, which is why
quan it always dies somewhat when, to mend an old panel,
one layers it on old, already tarnished azure. In such
matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer &amp; apply imprimatura again,
then put down the azure. It is almost thus for other colors.
Also, azure ground with oil always remains shiny, which is
not a good sign for azure, for this makes it die.







Grinding colors

A slab of marble &amp; p glass a
glass thumb thick is more appropriate
than anything else for grinding colors neatly, especially for
lake &amp; for whites.
