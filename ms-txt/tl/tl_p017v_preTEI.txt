The large cannon, which is for great
batteries, commonly weighs fifty-five or lx
quintals. At the breech it carries the thickness of
<-b-> two balls & one 
<-l->of the three parts of one ball. At the front, it carries
<-ba-> the thickness of one ball &
<-two-> two of the three parts. It is thirteen or fourteen
pans long. But they are very troublesome to drive. The
head-on battery, to accomplish its task quickly <-is-> &
batter with great force, is at <-d-> one-hundred fifty
paces & at two hundred. <-And-> It is true that one
batters well from three or 4 hundred paces, but it is necessary
to give it more powder. Its common load is <-p->
of xx lb of powder, its ball of 40 lb. One
needs xxv horses to draw it. When one fires it farther than its
usual range, one puts in a half ladle of cannon
powder more. A cannon can fire
4xx or a hundred shots per
day, but one needs to refresh it every time after one
has fired <-di-> nine or ten shots, if the battery is steadily
continued. For if there is a break, it is not necessary to refresh it as
often. For two quintals of copper, or two quintals
& a half if it is for large cannons, one puts one
quintal of metal. # The
metal is composed at the beginning of eight lb of
tin for one quintal of rosette, while
for large bells one only puts six lb of fine tin for one
quintal of rosette, to give it a bigger
voice. For the more tin there is, the clearer the
sound is. <-Its-> For gun founding, if one provides the
material & charcoal, as one commonly does, for
masters do not have the means, one gives x to xii
lb per quintal. And <-for the mat-> when the
master provides everything, one gives him 40 lb,
according to the King’s ordinance, per
quintal for large pieces <-&-> such as cannons, and for
small pieces, L lb. For the more material there is,
the more profit the master has of it. One founds another kind
of cannon-perriers of xxx quintals which are longer than the
others, and easily eight pans long, & they are for
battering defenses & casemates, <-s->
placing them via trenches on the edge of the ditch
by night.

On each side of the opening of the breech they give the thickness of
half a ball. And then they also add on each side the third part
of a ball.



<-Ain->
One gives it two ladles of
cannon powder for its charge, & one & a half of
arquebus powder, & the same for the others.





#

The composition of cannons of France is of one quintal of
metal for two of rosette.
But those of Toulouse & Poncet  puts 
iii of rosette & one of metal.



The rosette for re-melting is more profitable than
cauldrons, which turn entirely into filth.





Old pieces are composed of almost <-de dem-> as much
of one as of the other, namely one part of
rosette & one of metal. One recognizes this
composition with a burin. For its substance is found to be brittle
& the particle taken from the burin is found to be mixed
with yellow & white.
