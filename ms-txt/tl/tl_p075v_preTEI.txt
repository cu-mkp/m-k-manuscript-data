For making gray wood

One needs to take three half-septiers of iron
filings, xviii <-s-> deniers'-worth of
glass alum, & as much green copperas,
six deniers'-worth of verdigris, <-am-> pitch,
& a quart of <-cuyr-> currier's
water, and if you cannot find it, you will put <-more->
rainwater  of small degree. 







For gilding on wood

First one needs to put down a layer of very clear glue, and
once dry, you will put down a layer of yellow gold. And when it is
done, you will take fig tree wood, & put it to soak
some space of time, & wash the places you want to gild, and
cut your gold with a knife to the price that you will
lay. And one must lay the said gold with 
cotton <-ie->. 
And if you can find a fig tree,
take the the white of one egg & stir it vigorously.



If your gold does not have beautiful enough color, you will take
a partridge feather, & make it burn in a
chafing-dish, and make the smoke go against what you have
gilded.







For gilding with or moleu

One needs to take a shell of gold
and, before you want to work with it, you will put it to soak with gum
water and lay it down with a paintbrush, &
polish it with a wolfâ€™s <-skin-> tooth when it
is dry.







Recipe for putting all woods in color

For making it black, one needs to soak it in olive
oil, and similarly for horn, as the case may be, four or five
days, & then boil it where it has soaked
for the space of one hour, & take it out of the
oil, and take some natural sulfur or another
