Gold not being fixed

Gold as gilding goes away once the piece is reheated &
kept in high heat, especially if there is some lead, for
lead will pierce in the fire a piece with gold, because it
holds closely with â˜¿.





Cutting lead

Because it is fatty & grips & sticks to the knife or
chisel, wet it & you will cut it like glass.




Sometimes gold & silver take on, through certain fumes,
some color during the casting. But these are not at all scales &
crust, but rather this color goes away with whitening
& bullitoire.





Softening silver

When goldsmiths who work large wares have
forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that
it bursts & cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,
when it is well melted, some dry mortar composed of sand &
good lime which has been worked, & pulverize it & throw
it in.



Goldsmiths do not work at all with
the silver from reals that is not alloyed, because it is
leady & when forging it sours.



Some solder, for small works & things which only go in the fire
once, with some old sou & carolus, reheated & beaten. 
However, if the sou is not very
good, the solder eats away & one needs to solder there twice,
& one finds there too much copper. Others solder with
half silver & half fine copper.





Iron scales

Once well pulverized & ground on marble, &
mixed with the aforesaid sand of noyau, and dried slowly
without reheating, it endures several casts of lead &
tin. Copper & latten come out well. But if it
is not well ground, like crocum, it goes to the bottom,
if the sand is not tempered thickly enough.





Metal filings

They are not made by themselves if they are not aided by some
portion of similar metal, melted to assemble them & put them
in a bath, for they are sooner burned than melted. Tin and lead
filings are made with tallow, the one of gold with
salpeter, the one of silver with sandiver.
