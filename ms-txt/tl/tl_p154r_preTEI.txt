  Gold not being fixed Gold as gilding goes away once the piece is reheated &amp; kept in high heat, especially if there is some lead, for lead will pierce in the fire a piece with gold, because it holds closely with ☿.   Cutting lead Because it is fatty &amp; grips &amp; sticks to the knife or chisel, wet it &amp; you will cut it like glass.  Sometimes gold &amp; silver take on, through certain fumes, some color during the casting. But these are not at all scales &amp; crust, but rather this color goes away with whitening &amp; bullitoire.   Sweetening silver When goldsmiths who work large wares have forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that it bursts &amp; cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in, when it is well melted, some dry mortar composed of sand &amp; good lime which has been worked, &amp; pulverize it &amp; throw it in.  Goldsmiths do not work at all with the silver from reals that is not alloyed, because it is leady &amp; when forging it sours.  Some solder, for small works &amp; things which only go in the fire once, with some old sou &amp; carolus, reheated &amp; beaten. However, if the sou is not very good, the solder eats away &amp; one needs to solder there twice, &amp; one finds there too much copper. Others solder with half silver &amp; half fine copper.   Iron scales Once well pulverized &amp; ground on marble, &amp; mixed with the aforesaid sand of noyau, and dried slowly without reheating, it endures several casts of lead &amp; tin. Copper &amp; latten come out well. But if it is not well ground, like crocum, it goes to the bottom, if the sand is not tempered thickly enough.   Metal filings They are not made by themselves if they are not aided by some portion of similar metal, melted to assemble them &amp; put them in a bath, for they are sooner burned than melted. Tin and lead filings are made with tallow, the one of gold with salpeter, the one of silver with sandiver.
